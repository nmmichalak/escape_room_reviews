      "It was amazing my friends and I were able to escape with 8 minutes left of time we definitely had many screams but it was so fun I recommend this room and I can’t wait to try the other rooms \n",
      "Loved it escape within 43 mins absolutely amazing.  Had a great time.\n",
      "I had a great time. Staff was friendly, funny and helpful. Did the Haunting room and had an issue with lighting at one point but it was sort of our fault. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back.\n",
      "awsome place good staff and very very fun I will definatly come back\n",
      "This was one of the absolute coolest experiences of my life. I had heard of escape rooms and always been curious, but didn't really think much of it. But my friend and I decided to try something new during my most recent trip to NYC.We were placed in the \"haunted room\" and left to figure out the clues to open doors. (and walls, and fireplaces, and closets) The vibe was amazing. I felt like I was acting in a horror movie, or just plain in a haunted room. Multiple times we found ourselves jumping and screaming at noises or movements. And always laughing right after :)It was the beginner room but it was HARD. We almost didn't make it but luckily we did! I'm sure it would have gone faster with more people but it was great working together just the two of us. We got so excited when we figured things out. The whole thing was just a really amazing thrill - like the best haunted house I could ever imagine.And it's affordable! A really great idea if you're looking to do something fun with friends that doesn't involve a bar.DO IT!\n",
      "Loved this room and I really enjoyed the atmosphere the room creates . We felt like characters in a horror movie. It's less puzzle oriented but it definitely requires you to think. Overall a very good experience. We finished with 3 minutes to spare. \n",
      "I LOVE this place. Totally surpassed my idea of what an escape room could be. All 3 rooms are so different and have their own specific styles of play.The Haunted is great for beginners, but that's certainly not a dig on the difficulty because this room is tough. Lucky for us, we got 3 clues to use, and our game master was amazing. The price is perfect, and honestly, the experience is worth more than the price tag.\n",
      "I'm so excited that they are now in Brooklyn! I went with some girlfriends and it was just a really nice way to spend time together. I didn't realize how challenging it would be! I will definitely go back again.\n",
      "So my friends and I were tired of the usual food and drinks gatherings, and wanted to try some group activities. The groupon deal seemed good enough to give this place a try. We all had a lot of fun. Even though we \"lost\", it was clear that the people who created this game are extremely clever and creative. It was an amazing experience, and there were clues that I could never have gotten on my own. I guess I'm no Sherlock :( But I'm looking forward to the next game that they come up with. I definitely would recommend this place.\n"

We each had different positions, 1 person was a scribe, another would organize clues and process them, another would focus on the puzzles, one person was the leader making executive decisions, another person was constantly scouting the room for things others missed or things that changed in the room etc. We all had a lot of fun, and each person contributed something that helped us get to the next level, it wasn\\'t just 1 person solving everything. Believe me when I say, every single position matters. Irene was a great host. (I think that was her name).

The clock counts down and you are left scrambling through props and items in the room to solve puzzles and quizzes in hopes of finding clues to get out. Prior to starting the game, they will go over the rules and have you sign waivers. I've played several escape room games and this one was challenging yet really fun! I would highly suggest it for a first timer player. Tips:-The best way to solve the clues is to work together. I can't stress enough that team work is vital! Keep track of your clues and communicate with everyone so you don't have 5 people looking for the same clues. -Wear comfortable clothes! It can get really hot/cold in the rooms so wear something you feel comfortable moving around in.-Keep hydrated and use the restroom beforehand. You will be LOCKED in the room for an hour!-Be very observant. There's clues everywhere! Look underneath stuff, in cervices, high above you, move things around...etc-Parking is terrible here! We ended up parking right next to the building because we couldn't fit our car in the tiny driveway. Make sure you tell them where you parked your car so you don't get towed.\",\n",

There's a last chance to use the restroom, make sure you take it because once you ask to leave the room, you aren't allowed to go back in.Once in the room, they started a clock and we broke into an immediate frenzy. It's good to work in pairs and call out to everyone if you found a clue. Meanwhile, there was a staff member dressed as a detective inside the room and a few times he hinted at something if we half-uncovered a clue and were struggling, in a major way. Without him, I honestly don't think we would have solved 3-5 clues... I could see how some people would be really frustrated if they got stuck.Anyway, the next hour went by REALLY quick! Like a lot of the other reviews say: Teamwork + Communication is KEY to well, find the key! The puzzles overall were fun, some more challenging than others, but clever nonetheless and you had to solve all of them in order to find the key. Time ran out and we didn't escape but had a great time anyway. I'd be interested in trying The Cavern.In the end, the only thing I could think they could improve on is:-Rather than allowing 12 people into a room, I'd say 6-8 max is better.-Allow an additional 10-15 minsThe staff was great in offering to take pictures after the event, even when they were literally given 7 different cameras and took multiple photos on each device. We left with a coupon for their other events, i.e. RaceLA, CityRace.Anyway, last tips:Plan ahead by allotting plenty of time before your scheduled event. Parking is in DTLA where majority of the streets are one-way and if you're trying to save yourself a few dollars, you'll most likely circle around a couple of times before deciding on where to park. The lot right next to building where you do the event was $7 on a Saturday, cash only. HAVE FUN and GOOD LUCK!!!\",\n",

I am an escape room enthusiast and this was my 19th room. I would rank it 18th out of 19 rooms.  (Spoiler Free Review)Parking/Lobby:First off parking is hard to find but I suggest trying to find it on the street or at the lot at 11th and Olive. If you pass by that it will take to about 10 minutes to circle back around due to the one way streets and traffic. When we got there the host was by the door which was very nice because we were slightly unsure where to go. We entered and were told that there were going to be 6 other people in the room with us (randoms). The lobby was nice; theres a bathroom, lockers, and a bunch of comic books that are for sale. After waiting a few minutes we were shown the safety video, told the backstory of the room and then walked  to the room. The Room:Our first impression for the room was that it was fairly bland and lacking in decor. We got through the room fairly quick but we escape with 8 min to spare because we got hung up on a puzzle and because one of our locks was being finicky (The Game Master(GM) had to come in and help us with it since we had the correct combination in it and it still wasn\\'t working). This room is a Gen 1 room, meaning the there is no technology puzzles in the room, just combos, locks and keys. The Zombie aspect of the room was one of the most hyped in the reviews but when we experienced it was sub par. The whole \"encounter\" is probably about 3-5 minutes since the zombie ends up leaving through the door (which didn\\'t make sense in the plot line). I had thought that the zombie would be super scary and be with us until the end of the game but I was wrong. The actor playing the zombie did a good job for the time that they were in the room, I just wish they would have stayed in the room instead of leaving. The Hint System: You get 3 hints in this room, if you so close to take them. The are offered at the 30min mark, 15 min mark and 10 minutes mark (if i\\'m remembering correctly). During these time checks the GM would open the door and say \"The doctor will see you in ___ minutes.\" I did not like that form of hints/ time checks at all, it really takes you out of the zone and pulls you out of the game mode. I think it would be so much better if they either had a screen with the clues and timer on it or a simple walkie talkie system. The Staff: Our GM was very friendly and courteous. She helped us get settled in and described the rooms to us very well. I did not like however that when you call the companies number with a question to ask, that no one picks up and it goes straight to a recorded message. Overall:I give this room 3 out of 5 stars because I felt like they could do so much more. The decor in the room was lacking and I honestly feel as though most of the room was wasted space. There were such few actual puzzles to solve in the room and the atmosphere in the room could have been better. The actor should stay in there room for longer, even stay the until the group escapes as that would add a element of rush and fear to the game. The hint system needs to be improved. Honestly, a $30 pack of walkie talkies would be sufficient enough because without it, every time you need a hint you\\'re taken away from the game and brought back into \"reality\". I would only recommend this place to people who have never done an escape room before. After doing so many I just wasn\\'t very impressed with this one. I\\'m hoping that their other rooms will be better. For the price though (we used Groupon) I would like to try to come back and escape there hardest room (The Office).',\n",

The transitions between rooms was a little odd; mausoleum to a study to a boat to a temple but the production of those \"roomscapes\" was up there with the best.

There was moderate amount of scavenging and tasking but overall, the puzzles were engaging and well tied to the theme.  The hosts in the lobby were friendly and professional but this room in particular, though, suffers from a lack of support.

But overall, these are above average escape rooms that in most other cities would be top-of-the-line.I would say these are perfect escape rooms for new participants. They are immersive, and creative, and generally fun. They will deliver solid experiences to establish what escape rooms are all about.For experienced gamers, however, these rooms were let downs. The puzzles were too straightforward and predictable, These rooms were linear to a fault. And the production value does not match the leaders in the city (Questroom and the Basement). That said, 60Out offers reasonable pricing and still very enjoyable experiences. I expect to return for some of their more advanced rooms such as Jumanji.'],\n",
       "   '/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study': ['My group did The Basement & The Study and we left both rooms very disappointed.Let me begin by saying that we were extremely excited to do these rooms and we had heard so many good things about it. Long story short we don\\'t think we will ever be coming back to this establishment. Study: The puzzles in the room were fairly basic but then they just became big leaps in logic. There is no direction to this room, and the hint system is at the discretion of the in-room actor, who only hinted 2 things in the room for us. Other than that she would just start yelling directly in our faces, talk about verbal abuse... We will admit that one of our players did break a rule by tossing a pillow in the room which ended up making contact with the actors arm. After which we were all reprimanded over the loud speaker which left a sour mood for all of us for the rest of the room. Do not put your actors in positions where there is no visibility and there is a possibly of them get hurt. An easy way to fix this would be to add a low red hue illuminating the space, that way both the actor and the customers have at least some visibility of what is happening. Frightened people will always have exaggerated reactions to elements unknown, so try to make those elements known. In the rules they are very clear about not climbing on any of the furniture however that is quickly thrown out the window as one of the puzzles requires interaction with some furniture. This had us all very confused as why we deliberately had to break a rule in order to solve the room. Also, throw all sense of safety out the window when you enter this room because you have to do some things that go completely against common sense and better judgement, again there is no direction telling you to do the task you just have to think of the unsafe action and do it yourself. The final puzzle that we got to was \"off by a hair\" as we were told by our game master at the end. This is always frustrating as literally a few millimeters can make the puzzle not work. This could be fixed by adding larger sensors or even making notches so that there are set amounts that triggers can hit. One of the most awkward parts about the end of the game was when the game master entered and asked us \"So how did your lovely actor do in the room?\". It\\'s not an audition, she\\'s already got the role you shouldn\\'t need your customers to give feedback on them while they are in still in the room with you. Because to be honest who is really going to say something bad to the actor when they are right there in the room with you: like \"Yeah well you see she could have done a lot more instead of just standing in the corner and yelling at us\". Onto the pillow thing: Our player realized their mistake and apologized for their reactions but the way the Game Master handled it was unacceptable and unprofessional. She walked us out the lobby, sat us down while she reprimanded all of us about our actions for about 5 minutes saying that she needed a \"verbal confirmation\" from our player that they would \"behave properly\" in the room and that she could have just kicked us out without a refund. Honestly we probably would have been better off with that so that we didn\\'t have to experience not only 1 but 2 terrible rooms. We all put that whole issue aside and we were now ready for the next room with hopes it would be so much better, spoiler alert, we were wrong, it was even worse. We were brought with our group & 4 other randoms into the waiting area where the game master yet again called us out for the pillow thing by saying \"don\\'t throw anything at the actors or anything crazy like that\" while looking directly at us. Seriously?! You already spent time treating us like children and scolding us after the player apologized for their actions, be done with it and move on. The Basement: The entry style to the room was pointless & unnecessary, I guess it adds to the theming & immersion? Felt like a waste to me. The Basement has even less direction than the Study does. Be prepared to turn the whole room upside down in search for things. The flashlights were legitimately falling apart & were horrendously weak. The puzzles were a stretch, some of the visual clues were hard to differentiate: imagine 3 of the exact same locks with a 3 try limit on them. (For both rooms) When we feel like we are struggling we should be able to ask for a clue, it shouldn\\'t be up to the actors to decide if we need it. Oh and in the room was an image of our player who tossed the pillow with the words \"PILLOW THROWER\" on it. Again, with the taunts & belittlement, are you kidding me. Not a way to make us feel comfortable or welcome anymore. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Only reason I give 1 star is for the decor and windows in the Study but even then it was very sparse.Based on our experience I wouldn\\'t be surprised if they try to not let you escape so that you come back and spend another $40 on it.',\n",

       "    'The Cranial CarnivalBrought a large group of co-workers out to Escapedom, so large that we had to split up and did all 3 of their rooms.  My group went through Cranial Carnival so this review will be about that room specifically.  The idea is that you have to enter a boy\\'s mind and lock up bad memories that have traumatized him and put him into a coma.  Not the most believable of premises but fine.  I\\'ll roll with it.After explaining the backstory, the GM walked us to the \"brain\" door and in we went.  I thought the entrance into the room was a little disappointing and could have been much more creative an in-line with the story (traveling down a dark passage way, a red slide), really anything more than just a doorway.   The production in the first room was decent but really felt like a square room filled with puzzles.  Other than the occasional pink squiggles on the wall, there was nothing really organic about it.  With a couple of exceptions, the puzzles seemed to mirror the memories that the boy had experienced at the circus.  A healthy dose of scavenging kicked off the room and we wasted time looking through the non-linear puzzles that are unsolvable until you finish the scavenger hunt.  One magnet/coin maze was a difficult frustrating time sync and we had some tech issues with an 8-sided polyhedron puzzle and one \"locked\" door was open.  That was room 1.  Room 2 was a mixed bag of some clever puzzles, some not so clever puzzles (light clock), and some downright frustrating tasks (fishing).  In hindsight, it was the tech issues that did us in and we came up about 2 minutes short of escaping.  Not the best, not the worst room, I\\'ve done and comes in at #112 out of 168 rooms I\\'ve done to date.',\n",

There was more trial and error and a little randomness involved.The man and woman that greeted us were fun, nice and engaging.  The guy continued on to monitor us in the room and was helpful (with clues) when we needed it.  Obviously this whole operation was set up and is run by some fun & creative people.  I see in some of the other reviews people mentioning an actress, but maybe we didn't get that far?!  I would definitely try a different room or other escape activity but didn't love this one.  It was a little more frustrating than it was fun in retrospect because I think that specific puzzle needed a main clue to bind all the random stuff together (maybe as a hint, they could reveal another framed clue that would give you an idea of what move you need first instead of the monitor giving verbal clues).  I'm not going into any detail so as not to give anything away.I also think a few details would make the room aesthetically a lot more cooler and make you feel like you are actually in a secret temple room.  There was laminating (which I get makes things last longer but just printing out new little papers seems worth it to heighten the experience) and labels/stickers that kind of took you right out of the secret temple and into Staples. lol.

Inside, the room was cluttered (deliberately so) and we started our quest to find... something and straighten out this mistaken identity situation.  With multiple (sometimes unexpected) rooms, the production was decent and enjoyable.  But what I liked most about Mistaken Identity is that the puzzles were logical.  Nothing ground breaking in terms of technology or creativity, but the puzzles fit the theme of the room and they made sense!  There were also a few 'ah-ha' moments and even when we needed hints, we were kicking ourselves for not figuring it out on our own.  This is the way all puzzles should be.  There were a couple of tech hiccups along the way but overall a fun and smooth experience.  It's a bit on the challenging side and beginners might struggle a little.

There are no traditional padlocks or number pads. There is a critical path for the players to follow, but non-linear encounters line that path. Certain players have roles defined in the context of the game that provide a natural kick to encourage participation and communication, and I feel like that's really clever and probably doesn't get enough credit.Jason is a great game master and clearly has the experience to know when and how to nudge versus hint, and crafted an experience for our group that felt appropriately challenging, but never frustrating. My first experience with an escape room just happened to be this one, and it was so great that I was motivated to visit a different facility on the same night. The only bummer here is that so much heart and soul has to go into the creation of each room that I don't want to come back too soon, because once I play Mysterious Stranger I'm going to have to wait until the next room is released.\",\n",

Instead of turning us away and saying that we couldn't do the room, the two gentlemen working just came in at one point to help us with the one puzzle that required four people. Without giving too much away, the room begins with everyone being assigned a role that will help you in completing the room. I really liked this idea because it ensures that everyone gets to be involved in the room, instead of just have a few players steamroll everyone else. The team elements that are required to escape really add to the experience in my opinion.The other major difference with this room is that it isn't your traditional 60 minute room. It's all dependent on the choices you make throughout the game how long it will last. Your time could end in 20 minutes, or it can end in two hours. We will definitely be back next time we're in San Diego to do their other room, and can't wait to see what this company has in store for the future!\"],\n",

It also had a strong smell of pets or the bad smell of a public bathroom. Then their guest waiting room was nothing to brag about when compared to the 20+ other escape rooms we've visited...That's where the negative observations stop. Upon entering The Bayou room, it was well designed/decorated, very interactive, and had a lot of variety involved to keep you interested the entire time! It wasn't a typical escape room where you have to open 20 locks to complete the game. Our game master had to inform us we were doing the right thing but gave hints if say something we're doing wasn't lining up quite right to obtain the desired result but this didn't detract from the overall experience. Teamwork is definitely needed as there's lots to do in there! In the end, it turned out to be a very fun yet challenging experience.

My group of six with varied levels of experience had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles which required some thinking out of the box for both rooms and a lot of running around.I\\'d recommend at least a group of four for Villain\\'s Lair and no less than four. I think we benefited from having six people because for both AI and Villain\\'s Lair there were a couple puzzles that definitely helped having more people, not less, which is the opposite of what I find for most escape rooms. (I find 4 to be the perfect number). Having spent a lot of time surveying other escapers to find out what rooms would work for a larger group, we settled on Exit Game, and I\\'m glad we did! Escaping in time definitely relied on teamwork!For Villain\\'s Lair there was a greater level of detail put into the room than in AI, and a lot less button pushing. However, there is one puzzle in Villain\\'s Lair that requires a lot more abstract thinking and may or may not take your group longer to figure out. When we went, the \"alarm\" was speeding up which made a couple of us think we had lost and didn\\'t escape when we still had 7 minutes left when we escaped! Since it was new to the San Diego space, we figured it was expected that they would still have issues and gave them feedback.For AI the details of the rooms were a lot less immersive than Villain\\'s Lair, and I felt most of the puzzles required button pushing. I liked the use of technology and the use of a computer. A few of the puzzles really forced ourselves to think outside of the box. Once you have \"escaped\" you can choose to do hard mode, which our group chose to do.Villain\\'s Lair we were told was a mix of traditional locks and technology (a mix of AI and The Lab basically), of which our group enjoyed more personally. AI is more technology and have no real locks that I can think of, and The Lab which we haven\\'t done is more a traditional lock type room.I really liked our game master, who gave us appropriate clues without revealing too much, just the way we like it, via walkie talkies for both rooms.I\\'d definitely add Exit Games as one of the top Escape Room companies in San Diego.

We also happened to have two 13 year olds with us and one of them had no experience in escape rooms so we wanted a place that would be a good introduction. I was intrigued by the asymmetrical set up of the When Worlds Collide room. So much that it overcame my worries that it would be too much for an inexperienced player and such a small group. Without giving anything away, this particular game is set up so that two groups can play against each other! One in the \"Fantasy realm\" and one in \"Reality\". Its essentially the same story, and the groups don\\'t really interact with each other except for the fact that only one realm can be triumphant. Other escape rooms I\\'ve played with two separate groups I\\'d consider a parallel setup because both groups play two copies of the same room, and whichever group finishes first wins. Here, whoever finishes first wins but the two rooms are completely different so if you are so inclined, you can come back and play the other side so try to avoid spoilers after your post game sharing! All this makes When World\\'s collide a great option for a large group. Up to twelve people can play (6 in each realm). Or even as small a group as ours with some experienced players (2 in each realm). Or take your normal group and play each side on different occasions, that\\'s an option as well! Thanks to our game master Chris for explaining and giving us our clues. We had a great time! The only thing that we noticed is that the temp could get a bit hot in the rooms so dress appropriately!

I did the reality room the first night, which I thought was a bit more challenging than the fantasy room. We were on the last puzzle when the time ran out. The group in the fantasy room still had several puzzles left to get through. The 2nd night I did the reality room and we made it out with 12 minutes to spare.

The main draw of the room is that it's very different than traditional escape rooms: the time loop concept was interesting and is why I'm rating this room as high as I am, and I appreciate that they tried something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, I found the execution somewhat lacking: the actors were all good, but the main puzzles just weren't that interesting, and there was a particular thing you had to keep on doing through the game that felt like it was unnecessarily added to the room as filler. The game is weird in that there isn't really that much to do in the game in general, so an individual person will probably contribute exactly one key insight since most of the puzzles are based on observation. This probably is worth checking out for escape room enthusiasts simply due to the premise and novelty of the room, but I imagine that if the idea catches on and more companies starting doing rooms like this (which is honestly not super likely to happen due to the additional cost needed to make this work) then this will end up being a more average experience.\",\n",

If you just think it doesn't make sense, I recommend radioing in not for a Hint but asking if you understand it correctly, because sometimes you are just missing something and you won't finish even if you think it over for 30 minutes. If they say the answer is a Hint, then you can reconsider if you really want to ask.The FT had some clever new puzzles that I liked but I think the Omega room was generally more fun.

Despite the wonderful hosts, polite and friendly attitude, the story telling before the room felt rushed and mostly pointless.

The puzzles were a madening combination of way to easy, and way to convaluted. The puzzles were often solved out of order, leading to confusion when pointless clues were discovered later. While challenge is to be expected, many aspects were more dumb than challenging, such as a 5 letter combo lock utilizing only 4 letters in the solution, broken props that seem like puzzles, and visual problems that are very counter intuitive.

The clues were very hard to fine (or maybe we are not so bright).   We did use clues from the Doctor twice.  Did I mention he was really good?  He was really good.It became clear we missed some things and by the time we got back on track, time was running out so we didn\\'t end up escaping.  Sometimes I felt a little helpless because the cells were small and with four people in them sometimes all I could do was stand in a corner because there wasn\\'t room for all of us to be searching.   A little more space so that everyone can participate would be helpful, or else going with smaller friends!  Also, if you have claustrophobia, the experience of being handcuffed in a confined space may make you uncomfortable.    You definitely will have more fun with friends because the quarters are tight.  Also, some wetnaps in the cells would be great.  Believe me.Overall, I liked this and after a couple of days, my frustration at not escaping has turned to scheming as to who I will convince more people to go back with me.   This is a well done experience.',\n",

We did a couple in Manhattan, but decided that, based on the great reviews here, it was worth it to head out to LIC to try I Survived the Room - and I\\'m so glad we did!!While the other escape rooms that we did were fun, they didn\\'t have the immersiveness, intensity, or incredible production values (not to mention acting!) that the Sanatorium event did.  While we were ultimately unsuccessful in completing the event, it was still so much fun!  As others have said, it is probably not an ideal activity for claustrophobics (but why would someone with that fear want to be locked in a room in the first place??), but I felt the crowded \"cells\" added an extra layer of challenge, in that one person couldn\\'t see everything in their own cell, let alone the cell of the other group.  The atmosphere is very creepy, and there are a handful of jump scares, but the fear is built into the environment (music, decor, props, etc), not just in people sneaking up on you.  And, as many have said (but it is worth repeating), the actors are amazing!
