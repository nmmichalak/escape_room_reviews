You all are a team of investigators looking into a string of disappearances here in the backwoods of Arkansas. While on your way to the area where the groups reportedly went missing, which is coincidentally in the area they are filming a movie called Deliverance, you get a flat tire.
A few miles back you saw a little girl playing next to a shed, so you think to go and ask her and her family for some assistance. As you enter the shed, looking for the little girl, the door locks behind you. You now realize YOU may be the next group to disappear in the shed.",2-12,60,Difficult,A little scary,8+,0.32
