"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Streaper's Escape Adventures in Wabash",https://worldofescapes.com/wabash/quests/streapers-escape-adventures-the-cabin,"71 W 7th St Peru, IN 46970","A desolate getaway.  A quiet cabin in the country.  No Wifi.  No cell service.  No landline phones.  Just what the doctor ordered for you and your friends to ""detox"" from the social media frenzy that has taken over the world.  It was tough to convince your friends to agree to this trip, but you finally got them to come along.  You arrive and immediately you realize this is something that horror movies are made of; but you decide to stay because a terrible storm has swept the area. 
 All you have is a radio in the cabin... no cable television, no gaming console.  Just you, your friends, a radio and a deck of cards.  On the radio you hear a public service announcement for the area: ""Attention all residents of Lucas County... The County Asylum has suffered a security breech due to an electrical outage near the building.  Several patients are missing and are considered highly dangerous.  Use precautions when answering to unknown visitors...""  Just then a loud knock... knock... knock thuds across the cabin door.  You jolt with fear as you and your friends stare at each other.  
You know not to answer the door... but this crazed maniac will not give up until he carries out his evening of fun and games with your group as the main characters!",2-9,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,0.21
