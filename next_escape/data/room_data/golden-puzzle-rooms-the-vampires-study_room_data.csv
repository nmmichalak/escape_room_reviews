What they found, instead, was the Tree of Life. After attaining eternal life, they became greedy and didn't want anyone else to discover the secret. So they chopped the tree down. Doing so, however, imposed a curse they must live with for all eternity.
For hundreds of years, many have tried breaking the tree's curse, but many have failed, and many have ended up the master's dinner.",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,10+,None
