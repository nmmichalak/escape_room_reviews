"Escape room ""Flappers and Felons"" by Escape Hatch - Bixby in Tulsa",https://worldofescapes.com/tulsa/quests/escape-hatch-bixby-flappers-and-felons,"7 W Dawes Ave Bixby, OK 74008","Those were the days (the late 1920's) when Mickey Gambino and Anthony Hatch could enjoy a good whiskey (illegally) and talk business with Mean Boy Floyd. Now, the Hatch Family are picking up the pieces after Tony's untimely death. It apparently happened during one of his annual poker games with members of the other known families. The killer doesn't find humor in Tony cheating at cards. Spoilsport!
Our family takes care of our own and we must retaliate and find vengeance before the cops find and send him up the river and cause an all-out war with our cross-town rival gangs. The poor poor widow Lizzy Hatch will certainly thank you for finding her husband's killer. We have flapper girls, illegal booze, and a mystery to solve. Game on!",2-6,60,Easy,Not scary,,0.75
