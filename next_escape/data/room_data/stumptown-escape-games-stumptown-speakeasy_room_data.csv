Even though he makes the best beer in town, you canâ€™t in good conscience let him continue to torture your coworkers. 

So, you have tipped off the cops and they will be there in just one hour to raid the joint. Not wanting to deny the world his tasty concoction, you have to find the jealously guarded secret recipe and leave the city so that you can open a kinder, gentler speakeasy in another town.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
