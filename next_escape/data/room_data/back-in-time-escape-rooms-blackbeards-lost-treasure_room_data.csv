"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Lost Treasure"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-blackbeards-lost-treasure,"21800 Hawthorne Blvd # 311, Torrance, CA 90503-7004","Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, was an English pirate who operated around the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain's North American colonies. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance. 
Blackbeard only spent about two years (1716-1718) plundering the high seas. Within that time, however, he amassed a great deal of wealth. While the Spanish were busy obtaining all the gold and silver they could extract from Mexico and South America, Blackbeard and his crew waited patiently, then pounced on the treasure-laden ships as they sailed back to Spain.
On November 21, 1718 in Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, Blackbeard was ashore entertaining guests unaware that two ships led by British Lieutenant Robert Maynard were preparing a surprise attack to finally put an end to the notorious pirate. In the ensuing battle the next morning, Blackbeard was killed.
When Blackbeard’s ship was searched, no treasure was found. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumored hoard of gold and silver, but nothing has been found. Blackbeard's personal ledger notes that his real treasure ""lay in a location known only to him and the devil.""
So what became of Blackbeard’s treasure?  Is it waiting to be found or simply the stuff of legend? Back In Time has been hired by an anonymous treasure seeker to go back and search the captain's quarters in Blackbeard's ship, the Adventure, and try to shed some light on this mystery.
