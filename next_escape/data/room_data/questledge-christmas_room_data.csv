Christmas is not a video game. It is an escape game experience set in Santa's house and workshop in virtual reality. You will experience a realistic adventure as if you were there. Never alone, as part of a team (of 2 or 4), you become the hero and experience totally safe situations that would be far too dangerous or just impossible to live in real life.
