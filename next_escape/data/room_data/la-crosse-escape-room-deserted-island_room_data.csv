"Escape room ""Deserted Island"" by La Crosse Escape Room in La Crosse",https://worldofescapes.com/la-crosse/quests/la-crosse-escape-room-deserted-island,"319 Main St. La Crosse, WI 54601","Ahhh, paradise at last! Blue sky, white sand and beautiful ocean as far as the eye can see. But don't let it fool you! Due to a severe storm during a small private plane tour in The Bahamas, your pilot had to take a detour to the nearest island...in the Bermuda Triangle. Everyone is ok, but your plane wasn't so lucky. At first everything seems normal but upon further investigation you notice some things just aren't adding up. The navigation and radar are no longer functional. The radio still works, but not for long... Time is of the essence! There's still hope but after one hour the backup battery will die and you will have lost any chance of radio contact for help. You have one hour to locate the map, obtain the coordinates, and find the key to the aircraft to be rescued! Failure to do so will result in the same fate that has loomed with so many before you.",4-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
