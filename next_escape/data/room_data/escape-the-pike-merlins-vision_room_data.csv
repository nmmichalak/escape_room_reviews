You are seeing things in ways you havenâ€™t before. Are your eyes playing tricks on you? Or is it something else? Premonitions? You must find out! You feel compelled to schedule an appointment with a particular eye doctor that you keep seeing commercials for. As you stand before the entrance to the business of Dr. Murray Lin, you are anxious.
