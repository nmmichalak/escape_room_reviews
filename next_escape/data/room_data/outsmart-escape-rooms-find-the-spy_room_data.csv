Over the past year, more than 20 CIA and FBI Soviet operations have been compromised leading to the betrayal of at least 30 agents and execution of 10 U.S. operatives. We've narrowed down the suspects to 8 agents. We need to find this mole to finally put the Cold War behind us. Good luck and move quickly!",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
