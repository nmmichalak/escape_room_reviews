"Escape room ""Fresh Meat"" by Locked Room Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/locked-room-omaha-fresh-meat,"741 N 120th St Omaha, NE 68154","Nobody ever thought it would really happen, but the time has come: The zombie apocalypse is here. Luckily, you and your friends have barricaded yourselves inside an abandoned bakery, living off stale pastries and icing sugar while the shuffling ghouls scratch at the door in vain. Unfortunately, there’s more of them showing up all the time, and some flimsy wooden boards might hold back a couple of zombies — but not a couple hundred!
You seem to remember seeing a butcher shop next door, and some fresh meat might distract your pursuers long enough for you to make a getaway and find a new shelter. It’s a bit of a gamble, but the clock’s ticking and your lives are on the line! Will you escape in time… or be dinner for the undead?",3-8,60,Very difficult,Scary,14+,0.21
