Travel back in time with your friends and family to explore the history of the World's Fair and uncover what the exhibit released…
Word spread that an unknown creature was luring guests down to an 'Evanishment Room' from which they never returned. The attractions were quickly and quietly closed. Workmen refused to dismantle the exhibits as the fair died around it. Two months later on January 4, 1894, strange lights were seen coming from the abandoned exhibit hall.

You will choose one of six personas through which you will discover frights, trials, and adventure around every corner.
