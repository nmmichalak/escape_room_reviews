"Escape room ""Santa's Sleigh Ride"" by Escape Again Rooms in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-again-rooms-santas-workshop,"3564 State Highway 6, Sugar Land, TX 77478","Last Christmas Alex lost Santa’s list but thanks to so many helpful elves, Christmas was saved.
This year Alex has his hands full! Alex has an hour to get Santa’s sleigh ready to fly. And if that is not stressful enough, Alex found one bag was left off the sleigh. The poor elf needs you to find the last few toys in the workshop and get the bag packed before the sleigh leaves. It is going to be the most tremendous of escapes if your team can work together to ready the sleigh and load the last bag of toys before Santa is scheduled to leave.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,5+,None
