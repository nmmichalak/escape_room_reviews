"Escape room ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" by Paradox Point in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/paradox-point-the-picture-of-dorian-gray,"510 South Euclid Bay City, MI 48706","It starts with a gift. A simple painting meant to reflect the youthful perfection of Dorian Gray but capturing so much more. It’s subtle at first, lines appearing in the paint not reflected on the living face. Dorian soon realizes that no matter what he does to himself or others, he remains the same whereas his painting becomes something… else.
Drunk on the endless power his timeless face brings, Dorian soon finds pleasure in his more wicked desires. Women love him, men want to be him, and his victims are either terrified of him or dead. He is unstoppable! The only evidence of the monster he has become is his grotesque painting locked away where no one can harm it.
Is your group prepared to uncover the clues and destroy the painting before Dorian can stop them?",2-4,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
