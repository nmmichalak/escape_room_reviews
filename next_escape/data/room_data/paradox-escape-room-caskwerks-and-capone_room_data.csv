"Escape room ""Caskwerks & Capone"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-caskwerks-and-capone,"7 E Palo Verde St #9 Gilbert, AZ 85296","The year is 1928, the height of prohibition, and you… are the right-hand man of the greatest bootlegger the world has ever known… Al Capone.
For the last few years, your gang has been raking in the big bucks and living the high life. But lately, you’ve been facing increasing opposition, primarily from rival gangs, the FBI and the most determined prohibition agent in the country… Elliot Ness.
The authorities are getting dangerously close to uncovering your whereabouts and distribution locations so Capone has gone into hiding. You’ve been tasked with continuing operations from your underground speakeasy hideout while he lays low. But, you’ve just been informed by an agent on the take that they’re closing in on you.
Now you need to shore up your operations, gather all the intel from the agent you have on the inside and escape to another hideout before time runs out.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
