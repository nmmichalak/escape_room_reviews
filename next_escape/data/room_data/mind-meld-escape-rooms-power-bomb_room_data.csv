A bomb has been planted underneath the wrestling ring, along with the only championship belt they could afford. Also, the company did not have enough money for an insurance policy, so this would surely be the end for them. Since you were the only fans that were at the match, you have been kidnapped by this wrestler and locked in the local high school gym which it took place in. You must now defuse the bomb to save the companyâ€¦and your lives.",1-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,14+,0.3
