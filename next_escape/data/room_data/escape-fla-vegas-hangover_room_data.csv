"Escape room ""Vegas Hangover"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-vegas-hangover,"2480 E. Bay Dr. Largo, FL 33771","The craziest night ever! I can’t remember a thing. What the heck happened? I don't even remember how we got back to our hotel room! What did we do last night? Who is Chang and why is he saying we have his money?
We have to get it together. The cops are showing up in one hour to clear us out because of all the trouble we caused last night. I don't think the slogan “What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas” applies to what we did last night!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
