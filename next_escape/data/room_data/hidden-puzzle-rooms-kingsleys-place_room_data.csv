"Escape room ""Kingsley's Place"" by Hidden Puzzle Rooms in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/hidden-puzzle-rooms-kingsleys-place,"1935 County Road B2 West Suite 75 Roseville, MN 55113","Bill Kingsley, a notorious gangster, owns multiple speakeasies in the area and has hired you to run Kingsley’s Place. He hasn’t had time to show you the ropes yet, but he’s sure you’ll figure it out. He’s at his son, Chuck’s, birthday party today, so he is not available to help.
Unfortunately, you’ve just learned that a police raid is headed over to Kingsley’s Place in one hour. You better get the cash and get out. And you should probably grab Bill’s favorite bottle of Gunner Ghost liquor, or he won’t be happy with you. Good luck, Bootleggers. You have one hour.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
