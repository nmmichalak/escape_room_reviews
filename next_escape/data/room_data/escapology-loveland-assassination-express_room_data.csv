In the new timeline that was just illegally created, a bomb has killed Franklin D Roosevelt while campaigning in Minnesota by train.
Franklin D. Roosevelt never became President of the United States, never implemented his New Deal Policy that helped the country prosper, and the United States, broke and demoralized, never entered World War II leaving Europe open to Nazi domination.
