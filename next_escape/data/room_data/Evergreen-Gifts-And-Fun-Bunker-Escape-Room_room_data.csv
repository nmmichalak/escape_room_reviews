President Franklin Delano Roosevelt used the platform as the arrival point for his armored rail car during World War II. His armored limousine would drive off the rail car and into an elevator that took him to a secret exit near the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Just off the rail platform, a room was maintained as his office and fall-out shelter should the city come under attack during one of his frequent visits.
