Nothing beats the smell of fresh baked gingerbread cookies around the holidays…except when YOU are the gingerbread cookies. As you gain sentience after leaving that 350 degree inferno, you look around and realize you and your friends are gingerbread cookies fresh from the oven. According to that annoying timer in your gingerbread house, you have 45 minutes to escape before that hungry Darryl with his grubby little fingers comes home for a snack. So, you better run run as fast as you can, escape or be eaten, because YOU’RE the gingerbread man!
