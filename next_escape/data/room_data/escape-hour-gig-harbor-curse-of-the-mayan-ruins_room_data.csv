"Escape room ""Curse Of The Mayan Ruins"" by Escape Hour Gig Harbor in Gig Harbor",https://worldofescapes.com/gig-harbor/quests/escape-hour-gig-harbor-curse-of-the-mayan-ruins,"3212 50th St Ct NW #104, Gig Harbor, WA 98335","The dimly lit corridors and maze-like hallways had us archaeologists intrigued. Stumbling upon what seems to be an undiscovered Mayan temple was more than fantastic news for our newly budding careers. With adrenaline running through our veins and aspirations in our eyes we investigated further. It seemed with every turn there was more and more treasure to be found and great discoveries ahead.
Although with each new finding, the air became colder, we all began to feel uneasy; this omnipresence was deafening. Something is happening. The further we explored the more lost we felt, until.... we stumbled upon a tomb, the entrance behind us slammed shut.
Where are we? What's happening? With anxieties rising we fight to find a way out. Something is off, there is an unknown presence here. A consuming presence. We must escape before it's too late.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.35
