"Escape room ""Tomb of the Lost Queen of Egypt"" by Escape Helena in Helena",https://worldofescapes.com/helena/quests/escape-helena-tomb-of-the-lost-queen-of-egypt,"735 N Last Chance Gulch, Helena, MT 59601","  The year is 1923. You and your team of adventures have arrived in Egypt seeking fame, fortune, and the redemption of your family name. Twenty years ago, your archaeologist father was on the verge of a major discovery: the tomb and sarcophagus of Queen Hatshepsut, the lost queen of Egypt. However, the sarcophagus he found was empty. The archaeological community accused him of being a fraud, bringing shame upon him and your family’s legacy.

Your father spent the rest of his years obsessed with finding Hatshepsut’s final resting place. He traveled far and wide throughout northern Africa and the Middle East to find her tomb until he and the members of his expedition disappeared three years ago.

Months after your father’s disappearance, you found a package that was addressed to you while clearing out your father’s study. Surprised by this discovery, you opened the box to find a satchel containing your father’s notebook, a map, and a note with the name and address of Dr. Niles Smith, a colleague of your father. You immediately contacted Dr. Smith.

Your meeting with Dr. Smith revealed the contents of the satchel may provide details that could lead you to Hatshepsut’s burial site.  Dr. Smith offered to fund an expedition to Egypt if you were willing to lead it. He warned of the potential dangers of your journey explaining Hatshepsut’s lost tomb was believed to be cursed and that no one who has searched for it has ever returned. Reluctantly, you accepted his offer.

You have gathered your team and have studied your father’s clues. The map has led you to a cavern that seems to be an Ancient Egyptian crypt. Could this be Hatshepsut’s tomb and your chance to redeem your father’s legacy?
