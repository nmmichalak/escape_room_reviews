The mob boss is tired of losing and has hired you to go undercover as a high roller. It’s up to you to identify who is stacking the cards and his current location before he returns and finds you in the high roller room. You have 60 minutes to decode the cards and get out before this crook finds you and takes you out himself.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,7+,None
