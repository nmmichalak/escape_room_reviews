"Escape room ""Motel 813 Escape"" by Port City Escape in Wilmington",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington/quests/port-city-escape-motel-813-escape,"813 S 16th Street Wilmington, NC 28401","Enter a 1970’s era motel room filled with items from a long-dead family. You and your friends are incredibly daring – or incredibly foolish – enough to check into Motel 813 on a dark and stormy night. In 1972, the exact room you are booked into was the scene of a grisly murder of a young family. While most people blamed the husband, the murder was never solved. When a second couple went missing after checking into this room it was closed to the public.
Now, you and your friends are locked in this room. If in 60 minutes, you have not been able to uncover the mystery behind their tragic deaths, your destiny will be no different than those of the guests that were here before you. Enjoy your stay.",2-5,60,Average,Scary,10+,None
