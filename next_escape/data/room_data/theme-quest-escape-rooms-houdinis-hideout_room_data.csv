"Escape room ""Houdini’s Hideout"" by Architect Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/theme-quest-escape-rooms-houdinis-hideout,"7019 Reseda Blvd., Reseda, CA 91335","You have volunteered to be in what is Houdini’s final death-defying performance – a Double Escape! The room you are in is booby-trapped with a timer that, once activated, will result in the collapse of the walls and everything in it.
Outside the room, Houdini has been locked away in a completely soundproofed and locked box — with only enough air to last an hour. Your job is to successfully break out of your room and save the Great Houdini within the hour, or the both of you will end up being part of a disappearing act that is permanent to your fate.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
