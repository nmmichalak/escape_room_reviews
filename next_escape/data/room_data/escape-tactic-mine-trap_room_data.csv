"Escape room ""Mine Trap"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-mine-trap,"130 Southside Dr Charlotte, NC 28217","You and your team of miners were hard at work deep underground in one of the most dangerous jobs in the world. Then your greatest fear was realized – part of the Black Iron coal mine collapsed trapping you and your team underground and in the dark.
The clock has now started. You know that oxygen is limited, and it’s only a matter of time until you suffocate. You must break through the fallen rock and wooden support beams, navigate the chambers of the mine and escape into the mine shaft elevator that will take you to safety.",2-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,10+,0.61
