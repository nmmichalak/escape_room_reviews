"Escape room ""The Backstage"" by Forbidden Escape in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/forbidden-escape-the-backstage,"442 East St Plainville, CT 06062","Nearly 30 years ago, the Mystique Theatre was one of the oldest running performance theaters in the state. That was… until people started to go missing. Local police leads found partial remains of many of the individuals in the basement of the theater, along with supernormal instruments and items of which have not been named to the public.
Although the offender was never found, the Mystique could not hold onto its small local following and closed that same year. ​Stories of figures in and around the building and only seen as shadows came shortly after, and continue to this day. It is said that they hunt for new bodies on the hour, and take those that are found.
The theater remains standing, although closed and abandoned to the public. Over the years many have been rumored to enter the old room, but few emerged to tell their tale.",2-8,60,Difficult,A little scary,13+,0.2
