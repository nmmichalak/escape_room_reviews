"Escape room ""Deception"" by Mind Games in Roseau",https://worldofescapes.com/roseau/quests/mind-games-deception,"106 Center St W Roseau, MN 56751","The year is 1935.  The greatest showman since Houdini is under suspicion for the death of his apprentice.   He was so talented that no lock could hold him.  No entertainer could out dazzle him.  To watch him was to see a man rush headlong towards death only to escape it at the last possible moment.  Now, he has vanished almost out of thin air.

You and your fellow theater goers are led down a path where illusion and reality blur.  The master of illusion knows you are on to him.  He has locked you in his magic lair of trickery and there seems to be no way out.  Can you unravel the clues to escape  or will his art of deception be your demise.",4-8,75,Average,Not scary,,None
