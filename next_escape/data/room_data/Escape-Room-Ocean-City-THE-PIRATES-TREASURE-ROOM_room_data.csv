"Escape room ""Pirate's Treasure Room"" by Escapomania in Ocean City",https://worldofescapes.com/ocean-city/quests/Escape-Room-Ocean-City-THE-PIRATES-TREASURE-ROOM,"11805 Coastal Hwy Suite I Ocean City, MD 21842","Many moons ago, from the arctic oceans to the deep Caribbean seas, a lucid and dangerous nameless pirate crusaded to the farthest edges of the earth, pillaging and scouring for treasure. As he sent many souls above, so too, did the heavens rage against him. As the seas toiled in the dead of one fateful night, a tidal wave ruptured his ship and swallowed him whole into an endless watery grave.
The wreckage surfaces when the moon glows full to drift in agony for eternity, its captain beheaded by the waters from whence he came. You and your crew must seek the pirateâ€™s treasure hidden in his haunted cabin and solve the mystery of its fate to escape before the wreckage sinks back down below.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
