Little did you know…  It was hunting season.
The cards are stacked against you, as you have found yourself bound in a dim lit basement with brick walls, no windows, and with several others.  The dripping of water in the background is becoming increasing painful to hear, as you become more and more accepting of your fate.

You’ve been “Taken”.

The kidnappers have dispersed for a very limited time, and you have exactly one hour to rid yourself of what binds you from freedom, or become the next victim, and disappear forever.

The choice and opportunity are yours for the taking!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
