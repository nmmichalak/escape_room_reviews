Imagine history changed; shattered. Imagine the Cold War, gone horribly, horribly wrong. The year was 1977 when the bombs fell. The Nuclear Winter that followed was long, grueling, and terrifying.  Decades have since passed, and we have slowly recovered from the devastating blow. Very few buildings remain from that time except this fallout shelter which still stands. Untouched. A monument, or perhaps a tomb.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,5+,None
