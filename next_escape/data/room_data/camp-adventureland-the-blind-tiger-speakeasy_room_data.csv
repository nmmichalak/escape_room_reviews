The mafia has turned this into an opportunity to make a killing. The city has been taken over by the powerful crime boss, Maximilian Malone, who has built a network of speakeasies on almost every street corner. You are a group of Treasury Agents. As the most trusted officers in the bureau, you have been given the assignment to go undercover as bar employees. You'll have one hour inside the most notorious speakeasy in town, The Blind Tiger. You must find the crime lord's ledger book - the biggest piece of evidence necessary to build a case to take down Malone and his entire organization.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
