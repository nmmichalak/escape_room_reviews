An expedition led by Sir Beldon Frye disappears somewhere in the Sinai Peninsula. A team of explorers and a dozen local porters were looking for the Lost Pyramid of Nebkaâ€¦ Or more precisely, something that should have been there. They were never seen again. Using the simulation reconstructed from their DNA memory, your team will put yourselves in the shoes of the explorers. Find out what happened to the expedition, and more importantly, locate what they sought.",2-2,45,Average,Not scary,,None
