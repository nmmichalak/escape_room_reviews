"Escape room ""Infected"" by Crisis Rooms in Frankfort",https://worldofescapes.com/frankfort/quests/crisis-rooms-infected,"20861 South La Grange Road Frankfort, IL 60423","No one knew that when the zombie apocalypse happened, the infection would spread so rapidly. Being a blood-borne disease, no one had the foresight to think about mosquitoes carrying the virus. Your entire team has been infected. You find yourself in the lobby of Shadow Pharmaceuticals, the only company that has been able to successfully create an Antivirus, but unfortunately it's only experimental and not readily available. With the zombie apocalypse in full swing, there's no one in the lab and it's locked down like Fort Knox. This is your only chance for survival. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. You have 60 minutes before you start to change; better make it quick!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,0.26
