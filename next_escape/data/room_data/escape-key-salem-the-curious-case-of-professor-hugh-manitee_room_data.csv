Professor Hugh Manitee is the most reclusive professor on campus, and you're going to write a story on him. If you can get an interview with him, you deserve the job. If you can't, you'll have to get creative, but I'll remind you that I cannot condone sneaking in after hours. Security is hourly, so if you get caught, don't think your press pass will save you.
