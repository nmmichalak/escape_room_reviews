Is Mountain Man trying to get you to take the bait, or is Sheriff Bullard the one that is reeling you in? Banjo Boy is a shady character, maybe he is the one behind this baited plot to lure you into the net. And whatever happened to Toothless Bob? 

Is it just another exaggerated fish story, or is it true that his Charter Boat went on an endless fishing trip? It is hard to know the truth when the water is so murky. You can fish for clues all you want, but you need to find a way to get off this boat in a hurry or the hook will be set and you will become the Catch of the Day!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
