Thousands of innocent victims of the Great Inquisition have met their death here. Many people know that instead of the last wish a prisoner could get a chance for life and freedom. Anyone convicted to death was locked for one hour in the mysterious dungeon full of puzzles and secrets.
The only person who managed to escape from the sinister Saint Angelo’s dungeon was the sculptor Benvenuto Cellini, the greatest master of the jewelry craft. No one else succeeded in the fight with the dungeon’s puzzles for an hour. They are waiting for you. You have one chance. And one hour.",2-8,60,Average,Scary,16+,None
