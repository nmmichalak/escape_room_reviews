To do this will need to install a virus on their network that will encrypt all their financial data, holding it hostage.
You have one chance to plant the virus on an old server before Equos removes it from the office. To do so, you will need to gain access to the server room and shut down the three security systems they have in place protecting the server. You will only have about an hour while the office staff is out on lunch, so make it quick.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,14+,None
