"Escape room ""The Feud"" by Epic Escape Game in Pikeville",https://worldofescapes.com/pikeville/quests/epic-escape-game-the-feud,"225 2nd Street, Suite 1, Pikeville, KY 41501","It's 1888 and you and a group of pioneers are heading west to start a new beginning. It's late and your group decides to stop for the night in an old cabin along the Tug river. There are shouting and gunfire outside. You realize you are right in the middle of the Hatfield & McCoyâ€™s blood feud.
The cabin appears to have been inhabited by both of the warring families at one point, with the Hatfields on one side and the McCoys on the other. They are threatening to burn down the cabin in 1 hour. They will grant you safe passage only if you produce a family heirloom for each family.",1-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.37
