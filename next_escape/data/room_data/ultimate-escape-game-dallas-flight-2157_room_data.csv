You are a team of C.I.A. operatives, given orders to infiltrate a warehouse containing the remains of the crashed plane. Your main objective is to find the black box and erase the audio data from the cockpit before the F.A.A. discovers any details of the true mission of the plane. The F.A.A.â€™s security is good, but you have one hour to complete your mission. Leave no trace that you were there. Fail to do so in time, and you are on your own.",4-10,60,Very difficult,Not scary,7+,None
