Your abductor has turned off the oxygen supply and left you to die and no one knows where you’re at.
To make matters worse, other noxious gasses have been leaking into what little air you have left, giving you just 75 minutes to rely on your own wits and cunning to free yourselves before he returns to dispose of your lifeless bodies.",5-10,75,Very difficult,Scary,16+,None
