"Escape room ""Bank Robbery"" by Smart Escape in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/smart-escape-bank-robbery,"503 York Rd Towson, MD 21204","Some would say that committing a bank robbery is a very bad idea. But what if this bank belongs to the mafia or National Crime Syndicate? Your task is to take at least a small portion of the money that they stole from so many innocent people. You have already entered the building, and have 60 minutes to reach the safe and leave with the money. BE CAREFUL! If you get caught, you will not leave alive.
