There is only one problem with Apollo. He is extremely absent-minded and very paranoid. We believe this genius Alchemist has indeed discovered an elixir that will grant the person who drinks it, everlasting life!
During the process of creating the elixir, Apollo went mad and only repeats one thing over and over again from his padded cell. “Pick it up, search for it and unwind it, it doesn’t matter you’ll still never find it!”
We need your team to enter the Alchemists’ laboratory and find the elixir before the contents of the room drive you mad!",2-7,60,Average,Not scary,,None
