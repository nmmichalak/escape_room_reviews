"Escape room ""Like, Totally the ‘80s to the Max!"" by Riddle in Mashpee",https://worldofescapes.com/mashpee/quests/riddle-like-totally-the-80s-to-the-max,"61 Market St, Mashpee, MA 02649","Get ready for a bitchin’ time! Welcome back to the 80s – before the internet existed and Facebook’s founder was still in diapers. The Donald was just a businessman with his original hair (we think). Prince and Madonna were illin’ and acid wash denim was never considered grody to the max.

You have 60 minutes to escape Heather's bedroom, a like, totally average teen from the 80s’, while figuring out how to get back to present day. If you don’t, you’ll forever be without your smartphone, Snapchat, and Starbucks. Can you get back to the future?",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,0.5920000000000001
