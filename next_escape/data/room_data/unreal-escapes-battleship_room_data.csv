The entire United States Naval fleet has been destroyed by a surprise, all sidesâ€™ naval attack. Fortunately for the U.S., there is one old, beat up, decommissioned Battleship that is left in the fleet. It is the Battleship USS Staten Island which was the last of the true Battleships to have ever been manufactured.
