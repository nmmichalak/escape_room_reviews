Your boss is going to be very upset if you can't get it back in time. Steal back the idea and be the hero of the company!
Each of the rooms is a copy of the others with a different spin on theme and in-jokes. All the rooms can be played simultaneously for competitive gameplay. This makes them great for corporate events and organized events. They are also just as fun to play non-competitively as a single group.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
