"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,"2510 Green Bay Rd Evanston, IL 60201","The village of Matsuri is on the verge of peace. The rival gangs that run the village have decided to end their decades-long-conflict by celebrating with a fireworks festival, and your company, Hanabi, will be providing the fireworks.
However, the grand finale has been stolen by the village thief and taken to their hideout! Luckily everyone knows where that is because that kind of goes with the gig when everyone knows you're the village thief. But without the grand finale, the rival gangs will accuse each other of sabotage and the warring will continue.
You'll have to use your brain and teamwork to solve the traps in the hideout of the thief and recover the fireworks. The village of Matsuri depends on you!",1-10,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
