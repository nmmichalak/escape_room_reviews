"Escape room ""Monkey See"" by Try-N-Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/try-n-escape-monkey-see,"3350 NW 2nd Avenue A2 Boca Raton, FL 33431","I’m writing in hopes that someone will find this after…after we’re gone. I realize now that there is no hope for us, possibly for all of the mankind, so maybe, maybe I can use what time I have left to warn you! We were wrong, so very, very wrong! We conducted our experiments and didn’t come to realize until it was far too late that we were the subjects. They’re no longer dumb creatures or simply baser animals! They’ve become intelligent and sly and unfortunately for us dangerous! The tables have turned and they’ve gained control.
I only hope that this note finds you safe and you’re able to escape and warn the others. Our captors are contained in the facility at the moment but I fear that’s not going to last. They will figure out our subterfuge, they WILL escape, and God help us, they will kill us all! You have to escape! You have to tell the world! Your fate and the world’s future depends on it!”
