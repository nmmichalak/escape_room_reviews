"Escape room ""The Dollhouse"" by Curious Escape Rooms in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/curious-escape-rooms-the-dollhouse,"359 Main Street, Fitchburg, MA 01420","There once was a woman who obtained something so valuable it was both precious and dangerous. Unwilling to destroy it, she entered the portal to the dollhouse to hide it inside before the men who were after it could get their hands on it. Since then she's gone missing.
We need it back. We need you to retrieve the goods. But fair warning, staying in the Dollhouse after the portal closes does have its lasting effects. Escape in 60 minutes or you'll never be the same again.",4-8,60,Difficult,A little scary,12+,0.26
