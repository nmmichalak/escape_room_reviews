"Escape room ""Escape the Colosseum"" by The Great Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/the-great-escape-room-tampa-escape-the-colosseum,"300 E Madison St #301, Tampa, FL 33602","As a prisoner deep under the Colosseum, you await your turn in battle. Spartacus was once imprisoned in the very cells you currently occupy, and he managed to escape. To help others follow his path to freedom, he left a series of clues and challenges showing the way but made them clever enough so the guards couldn’t follow his path. Studying the timing of the guard patrols, you realize you have a 100-minute window with which to make your escape or face the uncertainty of the arena against tested gladiators.

Get ready for a unique adventure like no other! You will work your way through multiple distinct rooms under the Colosseum, working together with your fellow prisoners – and maybe a little help from unsuspected allies – finding clues and solving puzzles in your effort to Escape the Colosseum! May the Gods of Rome have mercy on you and bless your path to escape!

Escape the Colosseum is one of the longest escape adventures in the world at up to 100 minutes. The attention to detail makes this a deeply immersive experience and you truly feel like you have been transported 2,000 years into the past. If the ancient Romans didn’t use a Master Lock or modern tool, you won’t find them in this period themed experience! There is no in-room Game Master and our hint delivery system is unique and incorporated seamlessly into the storyline.
