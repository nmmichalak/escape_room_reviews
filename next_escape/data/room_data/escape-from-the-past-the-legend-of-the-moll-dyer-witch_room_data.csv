In the late 1600’s Moll Dyer was a hermit that lived in the forest away from the other settlers. When bad things such as crops failing, freak storms, sudden unexplained deaths and freak accidents started to happen, the settlers blamed Moll Dyer. One winter, a group of settlers went to her hovel and set it ablaze. 
Moll Dyer fled into the forest. Several weeks later a boy found her frozen body. Her body was kneeling beside a rock with one hand raised as if casting a spell and the other resting on a small boulder, which had an imprint of her hand (This boulder is on display today in downtown Leonardtown.) Initially, the settlers were relieved until their troubles started again. 
Now you get to go back to her hovel and find out if she really was a witch!",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
