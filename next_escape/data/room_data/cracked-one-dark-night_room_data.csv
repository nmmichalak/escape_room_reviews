"Escape room ""One Dark Night"" by Cracked in Wausau",https://worldofescapes.com/wausau/quests/cracked-one-dark-night,"4613, Ste C, Camp Phillips Rd Weston, WI 54476","Not long ago, but long enough to forget, four brothers worked together to build hunting cabins deep in the Northern Wisconsin woods. For many Falls, these cabins were abuzz with activity. But time played its duteous role, and the cabins became a memory, a forgotten family heirloom. Although wilderness has claimed everything else, Cabin No. 4 remains.

Recently, the cabin was handed down from grandfather to grandson. With the passing of the grandfather, an evil was born. Though this cabin was once used to put food on the table, it is now used to feed a much, much darker hunger. A hunger laid in wait, until now.

With heroic effort, your team has forged through the wilderness and made your way into the cabin. As a storm rages outside, your team must unveil the sinister secrets inside. Thrilling, and spine-tingling, this room is NOT for the faint of heart. Can you and your team make it out in timeâ€¦ or at all?",2-8,60,Average,Scary,16+,None
