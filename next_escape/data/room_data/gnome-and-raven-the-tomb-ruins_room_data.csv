"Escape room ""The Tomb Ruins"" by Gnome & Raven in Richmond (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/richmond-v-a/quests/gnome-and-raven-the-tomb-ruins,"9200 Stony Point Pkwy Richmond, VA 23235","Ever since archaeologists uncovered the tomb of the young pharaoh Nekauba and took his favorite ruby, strange things have happened in every museum to display it. Inexplicably, museum workers would find nearby exhibits damaged or broken and mysterious power outages plagued every building to store it. Some even claim that a ghostly red light fills the hallways at night.
It was finally decided that the ruby needed to be returned to its beloved and rightful owner. Your job is to navigate Nekauba’s tomb and restore the ruby to his tomb once again. But beware – the tomb is still protected by traps and ancient puzzles and getting to the pharaoh’s room won’t be easy!",1-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
