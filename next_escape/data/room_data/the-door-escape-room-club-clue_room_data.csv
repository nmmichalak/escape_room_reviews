Suite D1 Charlotte, NC 28217","You and your group will enter into Club Clue as detectives to solve a recent murder. Professor Pete Pamplemousse was just found dead here at Club Clue. The professor taught French literature and history at the local university and it was suspected that he had secretive ties to the CIA, possibly as a spy.
Pamplemousse had been seen entering the club earlier in the night with sunglasses and a hat on by the bouncer. The club had a brief power surge and the lights went out. When they came back on, the professor was dead.
We have kept all of the suspects around for questioning. It is your job to find out “Who Did It, When, and with What.” Can you solve the crime before time is up?",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,18+,None
