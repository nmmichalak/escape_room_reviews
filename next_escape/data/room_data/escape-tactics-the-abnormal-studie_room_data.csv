"Escape room ""The Abnormal Studie"" by Escape Tactics in Wenatchee",https://worldofescapes.com/wenatchee/quests/escape-tactics-the-abnormal-studie,"415 King St Wenatchee, WA 98801","Hallo meine freunde! It’s been a wunderbar day as you prepare to sit down in your studie with a good book and an even better drink. Suddenly, you can’t help but notice those strange noises coming from your bookshelf… “Do you think they can find it? They could never stand a chance in solving the mystery of the Castle!”
Intrigued, you turn around and find yourself struggling with this dilemma; continue straight and exit your studie for the night, or turn back around and explore the bookshelf in greater detail. You ultimately decide the latter path and begin your slow approach to those ominous voices; who would ever want to choose the less worrisome path?
Your body now only inches away and fingers slightly grazing the spine of each book as if trying to read the contents inside, there is a large crescendo in whispers coming from all over the room. Seeing no other option, you are determined to solve the mystery of this “Castle” that the whispers so frequently repeat like a poorly made record. Do you and your team have what it takes to uncover the mystery of the Abnormal Studie?",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,10+,None
