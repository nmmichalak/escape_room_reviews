Strange things have been happening in the town. The terror started when the lights came back on at Grandma Agnesâ€™s old house. No one can explain the dark figure in the window or the strange noises, but now neighborhood children are missing.
Uncle Garrett thinks he knows the source of this evil and has asked you to help him stop it. As you step on the porch to greet the sweet lady that now inhabits the house, the air becomes musty and you can hear the souls clawing for help. You quickly realize that she is not who she says she is. Your only goal is to make it out alive.",3-8,60,Average,A little scary,15+,None
