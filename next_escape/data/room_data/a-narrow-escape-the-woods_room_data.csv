"Escape room ""The Woods"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-the-woods,"1502 N Semoran Blvd Suite 160 Orlando, FL 32807","Your team has received a distress call from Edwin Hubble, a famous astronomer who lives in the Aokigahara woods. He studies the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies coinciding with Zodiac Signs in this famous Japanese forest. Mr. Hubble has requested an evac utilizing our private emergency broadcast radio. The frequency drops right before heâ€™s able to give out the coordinates.
Your team has been assigned to venture into the woods in search of his location so you can relay to your helicopter crew the coordinates for evac. There is no sunlight left, so you must be quick to evacuate Edwin and your team before the helicopter you came in on leaves. They will wait no more than an hour in fear of the legend the forest holds within. Anyone can enter the sunrise, but no one can escape the sunset.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,0.21
