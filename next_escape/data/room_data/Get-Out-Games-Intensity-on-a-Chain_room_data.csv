"Escape room ""Zombie on a Chain"" by GetOut Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/Get-Out-Games-Intensity-on-a-Chain,"202 W 400 S Salt Lake City, UT 84101","Zombie on a Chain is a fun and thrilling experience, unlike anything you’ve ever done before. Although this room still requires a savvy brain or two, there is a catch: chained to the wall in the room is a ravenous zombie…and he wants to eat you! Did we mention that his chain extends a little longer every 5 minutes?
Don’t worry, our zombie is not the gory blood and guts kind. This is also not a “spooky” experience and the room is fully lit. Admittedly, our zombie does have anger management issues, but he is not the brightest light on the Christmas tree, and you may just find yourself chuckling at his antics.",6-12,60,Average,Not scary,,None
