With the captain locked in his quarters, the disloyal pirates scuttled the ship, gathered up whatever items they deemed to be valuable, and fled aboard the lifeboats. However, one item was overlooked. A seemingly insignificant stone stolen from a merchant vessel. This stone, we believe, is the artifact.
