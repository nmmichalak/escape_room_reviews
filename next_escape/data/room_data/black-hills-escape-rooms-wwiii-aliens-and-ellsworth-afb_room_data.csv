Several of those events occurred in South Dakota. 

​On June 25, 1966 a report was called in SAC at Ellsworth that there was a flying saucer sitting on the cover of one of the minuteman ICBMs. Power was cut at the silo and had to be restored. Helicopters were dispatched and upon arrival the alien craft departed as witnessed by the crews. 

These reports continued for much of the next week. 

Were there aliens at the silos and if so what did they do over the course of that week?
