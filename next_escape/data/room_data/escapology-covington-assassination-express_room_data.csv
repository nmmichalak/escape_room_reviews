"Escape room ""Assassination Express"" by Escapology Covington in Covington",https://worldofescapes.com/covington/quests/escapology-covington-assassination-express,"3025 Pinnacle Pkwy Covington, LA 70433","In the timeline you know, Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected the 32nd President of the United States in November of 1932. As President, he led us through one of the worst times in U.S. History, the Great Depression and World War 2.
In the new timeline that was just illegally created, a bomb has killed Franklin D Roosevelt while campaigning in Minnesota by train. Franklin D. Roosevelt never became President of the United States, never implemented his New Deal Policy that helped the country prosper, and the United States never entered World War 2, leaving Europe open to Nazi domination.
You and your team will be transported to the dining car of the train just before bomb detonation to defuse the bomb. Doing so will correct the timeline, saving Europe.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
