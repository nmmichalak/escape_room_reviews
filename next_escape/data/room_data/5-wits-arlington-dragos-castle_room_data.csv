"Escape room ""Drago's Castle"" by 5 Wits Arlington in Arlington (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/arlington-va/quests/5-wits-arlington-dragos-castle,"4238 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA 22203","A mighty and terrifying dragon has broken out of the storybook world and is roaming free in the castle. You’ll need to team up with a princess to navigate the castle’s corridors, break free of the dungeon, and find the book with the power to seal the beast back in its pages. The princess will be a powerful ally on your quest, but take care – if she uses too much of her magic helping you, that won’t spell a storybook ending when it comes time to face the dragon!",2-12,30,Average,Not scary,12+,None
