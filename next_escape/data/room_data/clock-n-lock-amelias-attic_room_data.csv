This, ultimately, led to her eagerness to fly airplanes. After becoming rescued and living on a remote island, she chose to live quietly under a new identity when she returned to the mainland. Fame had continually intruded into her life and her fateful last flight provided her with an opportunity to step out of the limelight. She avoided fame and chased her dreams. Only the brother of her navigator knew of her survival although, occasionally, she would send cryptic postcards from around the world to her parents who – recognizing her handwriting – held hope that she was alive and well.
