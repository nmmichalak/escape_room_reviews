San Marcos, Blvd Suite 103, San Marcos, CA 92078","Since the apocalypse, things just haven't been going your way. You've lost all your worldly possessions, and have been trying to survive in your dystopian neighborhood with the few survivors you've managed to meet along the way.
The human race is being wiped out by the XT-28 virus, which is deadly and spreading rapidly. Luckily, a brilliant scientist works in your neighborhood, and he created the only known cure for XT-28. Being a rather paranoid individual, he protected the formula in his lab behind a safe wall of codes and puzzles.
Unfortunately he has fallen victim to insanity and has disappeared without a trace and you and your fellow survivors have just contracted XT-28 and have 45 minutes to sneak into the Mad Scientist's lab, find his secret formula, all the ingredients, and properly mix up a batch of the antidote for yourselves before you are taken by this deadly virus!",2-5,45,Difficult,Not scary,13+,None
