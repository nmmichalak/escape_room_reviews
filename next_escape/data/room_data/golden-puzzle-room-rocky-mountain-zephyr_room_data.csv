"Escape room ""Rocky Mountain Zephyr"" by Golden Puzzle Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/golden-puzzle-room-rocky-mountain-zephyr,"860 Tabor St #210 Lakewood, CO 80401",No one is in the locomotive cab and the Rocky Mountain Zephyr is rolling down the line. You are the only ones left aboard as it barrels down the track. Dispatch says you only have one hour before the train rolls through High Point Curve. A train going that fast would surely jump the rails and plummet down the cliff.  Can you stop the train before it gets there?,2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
