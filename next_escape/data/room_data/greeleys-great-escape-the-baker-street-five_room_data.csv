"Escape room ""The Baker Street Five"" by Greeley's Great Escape in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/greeleys-great-escape-the-baker-street-five,"901 35th Ave A, Greeley, CO 80634","Late last night, a gang held a secret meeting at the docks to plan their most elaborate heist yet: the theft of the crown jewels. This meeting started out as every other meeting had, but it quickly took an unexpected turn. 

A few of the members seemed unusually nervous. Tension and suspicion was running high, and a minor disagreement that arose while planning the heist quickly escalated into a heated argument. The argument ended when one member was accused of being a snitch, and shots were fired. When the smoke cleared, one crew member lay dead, killed by a single bullet to the head. The remaining crew members immediately fled the scene. ",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,14+,0.37
