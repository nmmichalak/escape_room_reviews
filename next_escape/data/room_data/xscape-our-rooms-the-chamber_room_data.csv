"Escape room ""The Chamber"" by Xscape Our Rooms in St. Augustine",https://worldofescapes.com/st-augustine/quests/xscape-our-rooms-the-chamber,"197 Blackford Way, Suite B, Saint Augustine, FL 32086","You are a member of a building demolition team, and you are making a last sweep of an abandoned building before its leveled. You come across two previously undiscovered chambers within the building. The chambers seem to contain a collection of artifacts, past, present and perhaps even the future... with an apparent link to Da Vinci, the universe and more.
Unfortunately, the door has closed and you are locked inside, with only 60 minutes before auto-detonation occurs. Can you decipher the clues you find and escape the chambers?
The Chamber is designed as a competition game: there are two identical rooms for teams to race each other to see who can escape first. Each room is suited for 2-6 players. It can also be played in single room mode without competing against another team.",2-12,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
