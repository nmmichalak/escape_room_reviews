"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Revenge"" by Booby Trap Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/booby-trap-escape-rooms-pharaohs-revenge,"100 N Gasser Rd Suite B Baraboo, WI 53913","Welcome to the hot sands of the Egyptian desert. You’re part of a large archeological dig team that’s looking for lost artifacts near the Valley of the Kings. Your team has been using an old stone structure as a field office to run the operation, which started nearly 4 months ago. During that time, your team found nothing…until last night.

Just before dusk, a large stash of ancient artifacts was discovered. Instead of starting the morning by examining and cataloging the artifacts, you drew the short straw and had to make a routine supply run into town.

Upon your return, you realize something went terribly wrong. The other members who stayed behind at the dig site are lying outside of the field office, barely conscious and near death. Now it’s up to you to figure out what caused this sickness and help the team before it’s too late.

Your fellow archaeologists are barely holding on, so your time inside the field office is limited. Work together to look for clues and solve the puzzles. Now it’s time to get to work. They are all counting on you.",2-10,60,Easy,Not scary,,None
