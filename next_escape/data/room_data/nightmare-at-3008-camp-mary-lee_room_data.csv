"Escape room ""Camp Mary Lee"" by Nightmare at 3008 in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/nightmare-at-3008-camp-mary-lee,"1731 Decatur Hwy Coalburg, AL 35068","In 1870, Camp Mary Lee was formed with brothel houses and saloons. It was named after Mary Lee Boyle, whose husband died from being trapped in the mines. It is said that Mary went crazy looking for her love. 

     By 1910 the prohibition fueled a number of fights and feuds in the camp, while brothers, Arthur and Walter Jones, claimed responsibility for more than 100 murders in the area. This is now known as Bloody Beat 22.

     Some say that can still hear the children of the camp playing in the woods, while others claim that they can hear the screams from Bloody Beat 22. 

Come visit Camp Mary, but beware of the Jones Brother spirits.",2-14,60,Average,Scary,,None
