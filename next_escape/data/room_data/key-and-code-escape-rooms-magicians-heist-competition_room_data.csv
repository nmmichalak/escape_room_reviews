For the last apprentice of Frida Hatrick, the world’s most famous female magician, that was literally the case. Her previous apprentice made a near fatal mistake with a saw blade and now Frida wears a scarf around her neck to disguise the scar. But the show must go on!

Frida has recently announced an enormous magic tour spanning 50 countries and 5 continents and needs a new group of apprentices to help her amaze and astonish her worldwide audiences! Fame and fortune await the winner but to BE the best you have to BEAT the best.
