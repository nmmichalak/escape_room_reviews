Loveland, OH 45140","A highly contagious airborne virus called TS-51 has just been released in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The virus kills anyone infected within 4 hours. The virus was created by the reclusive Dr. Walter Ryan years ago and was thought to have been destroyed, along with the antidote, in his lab explosion on September 17, 2013.
You and your team will travel back in time to September 16, 2013, the day before the explosion, to Dr. Walter Ryanâ€™s lab to find and retrieve the antidote formula. The time portal can only be held open for 60 minutes, so time is of the essence. Billions of people are counting on you.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
