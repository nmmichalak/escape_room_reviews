"Escape room ""Candy Shop"" by Mission: Escape in Valparaiso",https://worldofescapes.com/valparaiso/quests/mission-escape-candy-shop,"1050 Broadway Suite 3 Chesterton, IN 46304","You and your cousins have inherited your estranged grandfather's candy shop, which was known for its unique chocolate. Being a rather distrustful old man, Grandpa refused to share his recipe with anyone, even his employees. He hid pieces of his recipe, protected by puzzles, throughout the candy shop for his heirs to find so that they could continue his legacy.
If you find the recipe, you can continue Grandpa's business and use the profit to pay back the rest of the mortgage. If you do not, the bank will repossess the candy shop and Grandpa's perfect chocolate recipe will be lost forever!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,None
