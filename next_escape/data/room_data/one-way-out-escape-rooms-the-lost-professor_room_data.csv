Rumors have circulated around the college since his disappearance.
Reading through the Professor’s notes you find evidence of a major discovery deep in a South American jungle. With this information, you’ve packed your bags, plotted a course for a long-lost temple. If you can find it and what happened to Professor Marshall you will add your names to the pages of history, but only if you make it out alive.",2-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,None
