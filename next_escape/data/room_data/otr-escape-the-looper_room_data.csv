Police nicknamed him Oblivion because all of his victims have been found as skeletons despite only being missing for one day. When you enter the house you soon realize you have been led into a trap and you are now locked inside of Oblivion's Time Room.
Oblivion is a mad clock-maker who has figured out how to alter time. Anyone he traps in his chamber will age 20 years every 15 minutes. You now have 60 minutes to escape the Time Room before the time on your life ticks away.",1-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
