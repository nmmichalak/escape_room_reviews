The sun has set, and just as you’ve given up hope, a Yooper camp appears in the distance. As you approach you realize the owner must be out baiting his blinds - which should give you about 60 minutes to gather what you need and get out. If you follow the camp rules you’ll be able to power on the generator and get signal to call for help. This is a mission you don’t want to fail.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
