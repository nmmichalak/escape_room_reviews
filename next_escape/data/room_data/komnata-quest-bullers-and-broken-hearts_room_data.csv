"Escape room ""Bullets and Broken Hearts"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-bullers-and-broken-hearts,"67 West St Brooklyn, NY 11222","It is possible to find everything in the Sin City - cheap drinks, excellent stuff, a gorgeous girlfriend for a night, a hitman in order not to get your own hands dirty. But it is also the easiest way to find problems for .... yourself. And then you shouldn't expect the police to help.
The police here serves Senator Rork who knows whom to execute and whom to pardon. After curfew, no one can leave the city. So you have just 60 minutes to find out the only thing that can't be found in the Sin City - Senator's dirty laundry.",4-10,60,Difficult,A little scary,16+,None
