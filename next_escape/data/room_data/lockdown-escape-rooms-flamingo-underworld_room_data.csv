Las Vegas, NV 89103","I am Hades, God of the Underworld, and you are trespassers in my domain! I know not how you made it to the land of the dead; as natural causes, or perhaps as stowaways on the River Styx. No matter, in an hour’s time your souls will be trapped here forever.
Don’t bother begging me for mercy! I have no pity or time for puny mortals. Your efforts are better spent appealing to the other gods. If you can please them according to their particular tastes, they may just give you a chance to save yourselves.",3-10,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
