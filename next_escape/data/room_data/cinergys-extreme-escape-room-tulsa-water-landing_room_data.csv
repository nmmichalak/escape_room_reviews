The red eye flight from Amsterdam to Newark was a fairly ordinary flight, for a smuggler. You are hidden in the cargo hold, when you are awakened by a sound no one ever wants to hear… ENGINE FAILURE! The pilot has done a fair job of landing you in the middle of the North Atlantic, and you are floating… for now. But no one knows you are hidden in the cargo hold. No one is coming to save you. It is up to you! Your goal within 60 minutes is to depressurize the cabin and free yourself before the plane sinks to the bottom of the ocean.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,18+,None
