"Escape room ""Containment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-Containment,"275 W Wisconsin Ave #2040, Milwaukee, WI 53203","The TR-18 virus was created by your team of top military scientists...not as a weapon, but rather a research tool. Its conception would have allowed decades worth of raw data to be observed and recorded, resulting in the ability to combat and neutralize within a matter of days countless unknown biological, chemical, or radiation-based weapons.
But something went wrong...so very wrong. An underground group of animal rights activists managed to infiltrate the facility and liberate all of the test subjects...and the virus they're carrying.They have no idea what the have just done. Knowing that the facility has been compromised, automated security measures have been enacted to contain any potential outbreak. It is too late for that.
If Operation: Clean Sweep does its job, it will eradicate any possibility of saving the human population, as it will destroy all 60 samples of genetic material that are resistant to the virus, as well as the 3 necessary binding solutions. Without all of these components, there is no hope of synthesizing an anti-virus in time to save humanity from its impending fate.",2-8,60,Average,None,,None
