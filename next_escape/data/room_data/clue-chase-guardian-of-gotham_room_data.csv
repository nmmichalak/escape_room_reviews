"Escape room ""Guardian of Gotham"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-guardian-of-gotham,"39 W 32nd St 4th Floor New York, NY 10001","July 2132 – Martial Law has been declared in Manhattan. Villains and crime syndicates control most of the major districts. Clue Chase Laboratories, now a marvel of high-tech innovation, suffers a break-in at the hands of a mysterious figure. 
Shortly thereafter, reports of a cyber-suited vigilante possessing time travel abilities begin to circulate. Comic geeks and journalists begin referring to her by the moniker “Doctor Time”. In the ensuing months, crime falls to a low not seen in decades. 
However, the public is becoming increasingly skeptical of the vast power she wields, and this would-be hero’s methods. You must break into Dr. Time’s lair, discover what they know about the artifact, recover our technology, and defeat Dr. Time – preventing them from amassing even more power.
