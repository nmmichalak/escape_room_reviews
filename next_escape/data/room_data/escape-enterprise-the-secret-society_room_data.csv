The organization you belong to, has an undercover spy planted in his office working to stop him.  That spy was killed in a car accident recently.  We cannot afford to waste his efforts; your team has been assembled based on the individual skills that you possess.  The spy who was posing as a janitor has set everything in motion all you have to do is get in and follow his trail.  Place the thumb drive into the hidden USB port and login with the username and password then get out before you are discovered.  Good luck
