"Escape room ""King Tut's Revenge"" by Expired Time in Findlay",https://worldofescapes.com/findlay/quests/expired-time-king-tuts-revenge,"1811 Tiffin Ave Findlay, OH 45840","British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of King Tutankhamun (King Tut) in November of 1922. After he opened King Tutâ€™s sarcophagus in February of 1923 he discovered the sacred scarab of the young King. The scarab was removed from the sarcophagus and a curse was placed upon anyone who enters the tomb.
The only way to remove the curse is to find and return the scarab to the tomb. There were rumors that Carter hid the scarab in a nearby location as he studied other artifacts of the tomb. You have 60 minutes to find the scarab and return it to the sarcophagus to lift the curse, the only problem is the sarcophagus has been recently locked back up and you must now find a way to open it and return the scarab before King Tut gets his revenge on you!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,0.55
