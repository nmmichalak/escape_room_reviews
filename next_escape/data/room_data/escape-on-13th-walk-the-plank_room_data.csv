None of your crew had encountered pirates before, until today that is. After an intense struggle, you and your crew have been boarded and taken hostage by the pirates—and not just any pirate, but Blackbeard himself! You’ve been locked in the brig of his ship, the Queen Anne's Revenge, and they’re going to make you walk the plank in one hour. You and your fellow surviving crew will have to decide your fate by choosing to follow the counsel of a previous prisoner or wallow in fear of Blackbeard and his crew.
