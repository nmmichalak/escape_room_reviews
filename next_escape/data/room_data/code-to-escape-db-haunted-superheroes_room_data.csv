"Escape room ""Haunted Superheroes"" by Code To Escape in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/code-to-escape-db-haunted-superheroes,"119 S Palmetto Ave Daytona Beach, FL 32114","Within the old house of your great grandfather lies a special room where he had hidden away his superhero collectibles, a place far away from his everyday life. Since he passed away, a long, long time ago, nobody has dared enter the room. They say it is haunted. People keep on hearing creepy voices from within the room. Rumor has it that he had some very rare action figures in his collection, which were believed to have been lost forever. 
Recently, you spotted an odd looking old man selling something extraordinary at the flea market. He whispered that you are the chosen one and only you can take advantage of his secret spell. A moment after he placed the paper scroll in your palm he disappeared into the mist. After deeply investigating the spell you have learned it provides you a shield, or ward, from ghosts in haunted locations. This protection spell is not unlimited, however, and you have exactly 3,600 seconds to use it after casting. Use your time wisely! If your team can acquire these valuable action figures in time you could be the superstar of the next Comic Con! No collection on the planet could compare to your rare action figure collection!",4-14,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
