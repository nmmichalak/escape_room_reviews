Archie seems extremely stressed today. He pulls you close and says, ""I've been doing some calculations at my home inside the park based on some of the samples we've collected. You must meet me at my house tonight and I'll show you. I have data of over 460 earthquakes in the park. A Yellowstone's Super Eruption could be 1,000 times larger than any in human history, threatening all life within 1,000 miles!""
As you approach his retreat, you notice a note left on the door… ”You are in danger. You have to act fast. In 60 minutes the volcano is going to erupt! I think we can stop it. I’ve hidden clues inside that I can only trust you with. Please help save humanity!” Are you brave enough to save everyone and every living thing or only yourself?",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
