Tasked with a simple extraction mission you and your crew are sent to the Alpha Centauri quadrant of space to aid the crew of the Nautilus space station. The ship may require simple maintenance or you may need to deliver the crew to a new vessel until repairs can be completed. Everything is very routine… until it isn’t.
