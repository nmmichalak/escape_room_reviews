"Escape room ""UltraViolet"" by Entrapme in Waterville",https://worldofescapes.com/waterville/quests/entrapme-ultraviolet,"105 Main Street, Suite B & C Waterville, ME 04901","While sitting at home thinking of how to spend your evening your phone goes off. It is a text message from an Unknown Sending. The message says there is a Rave at the old abandoned building in Waterville. After debating whether you should go or not you decide that you deserve some fun. You text a couple of your friends before heading out to the party.
When you arrive there are no lights on at the abandoned building but you can hear music coming from inside. You try to enter the party but there is no handle on the door. Do you have what it takes to get into the Rave or will you have to go home for another night of binge-watching Netflix?",2-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.39
