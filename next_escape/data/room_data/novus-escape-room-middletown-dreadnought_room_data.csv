"Escape room ""Dreadnought"" by Novus Escape Room in Dover",https://worldofescapes.com/dover/quests/novus-escape-room-middletown-dreadnought,"727 N Broad St Middletown, DE 19709","127 years ago, the world survived a catastrophic ice age known as the Whiteout and is now going through the aftermath of this global crisis, which blanketed lands with water and reduced the human population by large numbers. Nations now live on giant arks known as Dreadnought, which are able to sustain ecosystem and life on a smaller scale. Only a small percentage of land remains and every 20 years, candidates will be picked at random to be transported to this land to live out their remaining lives. Being the chosen ones this time, you and the rest board the transport vessel with glimmering excitement to finally see land for the first time.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
