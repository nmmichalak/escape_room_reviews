"Escape room ""The Box"" by Time Trap in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/time-trap-the-box,"8042 Old County Rd 54 New Port Richey, FL 34653","There are no actual clowns and all content is appropriate for participants at all ages. The room is dark, however. We imagined how a modern-day sadistic killer would actually design a room where you had to outsmart the killer or die trying.
While simple in design, the game is dark and difficult. The killer wouldnâ€™t give you a fancy television with a nice count-down clock and already thought through clues. It features a straightforward build out with nothing to take away from the puzzles. When you walk into this room, you are not given directions (at the hardest setting) or a storyline. You have one source of light and the BOX is staring at you daring you to fail.",2-4,60,Difficult,A little scary,13+,0.35
