As you may have noticed, Adolf is about to win the war, and your group of Allied Spies has been captured. Great job... You, and the rest of the Western world will be dead or enslaved by the Nazi Empire if you don't do something to stop them. To accomplish this, you must first escape from this jail you are in.
You must think like a spy and detour the nuclear weapon that Adolf deployed two hours ago. In your room, you have every single tool necessary to make this happen. Remember, in 60 minutes, any further attempt to complete your mission will be absolutely futile. The fate of the Free World is in your hands!",1-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
