"Escape room ""Wild West Jailbreak"" by Escapetown Peoria in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/escapetown-peoria-wild-west-jailbreak,"4812 N Sheridan Rd Peoria, IL 61614","The meanest sheriff in the Wild West, Alfred J.W. Abernathy, has arrested your buddy Clive after a fight at the local saloon last night, and swears he’s going to hang at high noon tomorrow morning. But you know he’s an innocent man. Your team has one hour to steal the keys to Clive’s cell and get him out of town before Abernathy shows up. If you can’t get Clive out, he’s going to swing, and so will you. Good luck, partners!
