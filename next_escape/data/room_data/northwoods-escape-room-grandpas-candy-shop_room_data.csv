"Escape room ""Grandpa's Candy Shop"" by Northwoods Escape Room in Minocqua",https://worldofescapes.com/minocqua/quests/northwoods-escape-room-grandpas-candy-shop,"332a W Pine St Eagle River, WI 54521","You and your cousins have inherited your estranged grandfather’s candy shop, which was known for its unique chocolate. Grandpa used to make all of the chocolate himself early in the morning before the shop opened. Being a rather distrustful old man, Grandpa refused to share his recipe with anyone, even his employees. When he fell ill, he hid pieces of his recipe, protected by puzzles, throughout the candy shop for his heirs to find so that they could continue his legacy. Apparently, Grandpa figured that you, his heirs, would be more clever than his employees.
Unfortunately, Grandpa had not yet finished paying off the mortgage on the candy shop. So, there is still quite a bit of money owed on the property and the bank is running out of patience. If you find the recipe, you can continue Grandpa’s business and use the profit to pay back the rest of the mortgage. If you do not, the bank will repossess the candy shop and Grandpa’s perfect chocolate recipe will be lost forever!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,14+,None
