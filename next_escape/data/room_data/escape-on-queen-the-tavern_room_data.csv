"Escape room ""The Tavern"" by Escape On Queen in Lancaster",https://worldofescapes.com/lancaster/quests/escape-on-queen-the-tavern,"43 N Queen Street Lancaster, PA 17603","Captain Johnny X has been plundering the seas for years but now he has met his match- HIMSELF! He has locked himself out of his personal quarters where he keeps his finest Hogshead. The crew has already tried to help him get in but they haven’t been successful, now there’s a storm coming and most of his skittish crew have run off. He is desperate for help and is willing to pay a handsome reward if you get him back in his quarters. I’m not quite sure why he feels that he needs to have you chained to the floor of the tavern though, I guess he has trust issues.

The storm is approaching more quickly than anticipated so work quickly before the rest of the skeleton crew leaves you behind.

Just remember to watch your back- Pirates are rarely what they seem!

You will only have one hour to assist Captain Johnny X and he does not take kindly to failure! Be sure to help him out or you may be forced to walk the plank.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,14+,None
