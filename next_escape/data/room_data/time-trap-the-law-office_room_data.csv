Well, you aren’t really supposed to be here right now. Your dearest friend is being tried for Murder and the jury will return in one hour and you are certain it will be a guilty verdict. You know she is innocent but how do you prove it? After watching the trial, you realize that the defense attorney knows more about who the murder is than what he is letting on.
In a moment of desperation, you grab your friends and decide to break into the lawyer’s office. As the door shuts behind you, you realize that the lawyer knew you were coming and locked you in. In a classic lawyer move, he has hidden the clues in an intricate web of puzzles and places so that he could find them if he needs to. You have to unravel the clues to find out who the murderer is, what the weapon was, and where the murder took place.
The clock is ticking and when the timer goes off the police will arrive. You will either save your best friend with the evidence the Court needs to acquit or become a defendant for breaking and entering yourself.",2-4,60,Average,Not scary,,None
