You decide to go out to a bar to kill time. Here, you meet a tall, grisly, one-handed man who begins telling you stories about a cabin in the woods not far away. Intriguing and vivid stories about a magical book called the Necronomicon cloud your judgment, and before you realize it, you are on your way to the cabin to retrieve both the ancient relic and the gentleman’s missing hand. He’s leaving town in an hour and if you can retrieve his hand and the Necronomicon, he will reward you handsomely.",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,7+,None
