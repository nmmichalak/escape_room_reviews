"Escape room ""Myrtletown Wagon Trail Escape"" by Riddles Escape Room in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/riddles-escape-room-myrtletown-wagon-trail-escape,"9713 N. Kings Highway Myrtle Beach, SC 29577","Betcha didn’t know there once was a Wagon Trail in Myrtle Beach.
Provisioned and ready to head west in search of real gold, this group of East Coast wanna-be westerners never made it off the beach.

OK, so we’ve made all this up; just roll with it please!!

The Wagon Trail’s main gold accumulation “went missing” some time back and bits of their stash continue to disappear.
Without this precious metal, their means to buy and sell, they cannot leave.
They are looking for good samaritans to help ’em round up the culprits that aim to keep ’em in Myrtletown and ultimately find their missing gold.
That’s where you come in, Pardners.
Are ye smart ‘nough to see what this little town cannot? Could the thief be right under their mustaches? Is the town destined to remain at the beach forever?",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,18+,None
