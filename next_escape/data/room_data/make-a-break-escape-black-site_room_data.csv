The CIA caught you red-handed monitoring the activity of several CIA agents. Your notes, journal entries, and actions are all part of the investigation.
Luckily, you’ve encrypted your documents, and the CIA is having a difficult time decrypting them. Your team has been monitoring your captors and have found a weakness: a 60-minute window in which the guards change shifts, and you’ve chosen this opportunity to escape. Your FSB handler is on the outside and ready to aid you in your extrication. Escape the restraints, decrypt your notes, and escape the CIA Black Site.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
