"Escape room ""Cabin in the Storm"" by Room to Escape in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/room-to-escape-cabin-in-the-storm,"3734 Allen Ave Fort Wayne, IN 46805","You’ve been on an adventure with your friends in a vast wilderness. The weather radio you brought along has told you about a sudden but severe thunderstorm moving into the area. You know there is no way you and your friends can outrun the storm on foot, so you radio for help.
The rescuer who answered your call for help says they can retrieve you by helicopter, but only if you can find exact coordinates to your location. You've got about an hour before it will be too dangerous for the helicopter to save you. You remember seeing a cabin not long ago, so you hurry back there and knock on the door. There’s no answer, but fortunately, the door is unlocked. Surely you can find coordinates inside.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
