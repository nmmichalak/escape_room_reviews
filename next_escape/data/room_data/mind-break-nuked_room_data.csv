But when a fire erupted in the break-room, all we heard was a huge explosion and then everything went dark. Without the power to the plant, it’ll overheat and blow causing millions to be exposed to the radiation. All employees were told to evacuate immediately, but not you! You are part of the disaster team, called to safeguard us all. We know the plant can only go 60 minutes without power, we must hurry! Find the control panel, turn on the generators, and open the cooling valves to neutralize the reactor before we have a nuclear meltdown!!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
