Before we get started, there is a little matter which we would like to discuss regarding the escape of several members of the Dark Order. While their current whereabouts are unknown, classes are to continue their normal schedule, but we must remain constantly vigilant. As first year students, you will be tested in many ways as you develop your skills in the magical arts. Do you have what it takes to become master sorcerers and sorceresses?
