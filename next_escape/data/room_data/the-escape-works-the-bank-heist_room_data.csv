"Escape room ""The Bank Heist"" by The Escape Works in Watertown",https://worldofescapes.com/watertown/quests/the-escape-works-the-bank-heist,"140 Stone St Watertown, NY 13601","You are a member of America’s most successful crime syndicate. Today, you’ll be facing your greatest challenge yet, as you and your team attempt a heist at the Valley Isle Bank located at 140 Stone St, Watertown, NY 13601. Your recon team has just completed phase one of the heist – they have ensured the building is empty and gained access to the bank manager’s office, where the door to the vault awaits. They have assessed the situation and have reported that this particular vault is going to be difficult to compromise. They have discreetly hidden clues, tools and hints around the office which you will need to complete your job as safe-cracker. Recon also reports that they have suspended the security system for 55 minutes. After that amount of time, the alarm will be activated, and you will have 5 minutes from that point to escape before law enforcement arrives. Your hackers are available to monitor your progress and assist you via the office computer as needed. If you do manage to enter the vault, you will have to make a crucial decision: take the available money and run, or stay just a little longer to try to significantly increase your take.",2-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,9+,0.3
