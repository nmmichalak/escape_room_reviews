You and your fellow agents have been handpicked by top-brass officials to take part in the final selection stages for a ""Blacklist"" division of the CIA, known only as NICO (North - American Intelligence and Counterterrorism Operatives.)
As this is a division that does not exist, operated by people who do not exist, housed in a facility that does not exist...should you fail, any memories of the experiences related to your time here will, likewise, cease to exist. Provided you succeed, however, you will become a ghost in the system and will operate behind the scenes, shaping the future of the entire world, while leaving behind nothing but dust and echoes.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
