As the night wore on, you become friends with a cute couple who had amazing accents, endless stories from their travels abroad and insisted on buying everyone’s drinks.
The next thing you know, your group wakes up in the hull of a boat as captives. Still a little groggy, you’re not sure if it’s been hours or days. Together, you’ll have to work to break everyone free, find out where you are, how you got there and more importantly  – how to escape.
You’ve heard from one of the guards that the ship leaves port in sixty minutes with no plans to dock again for months. If you’re going to save yourselves – you must act quickly. To escape, you’ll need to find the passport which contains the code to your freedom.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,,0.43
