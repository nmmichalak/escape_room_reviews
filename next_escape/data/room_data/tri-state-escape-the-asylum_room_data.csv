"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Tri-State Escape in Huntington",https://worldofescapes.com/huntington/quests/tri-state-escape-the-asylum,"1327 Winchester Avenue Ashland, KY 41101","From 1864 to 1895, the Ashford insane asylum was home to some of the state’s most disturbed individuals and some of medicine’s most questionable treatment tactics. In 1895, the state learned of torturous methods being used at the asylum and closed its doors. Since that fateful day, reports of other-worldly sounds coming from the asylum have left the locals in fear. Legend has it that the souls of those whose lives were taken in this place still agonizingly haunt the walls within. You and your friends have decided this Halloween to break into the basement of the abandoned asylum, where it has been said the doctors performed their darkest work. Will you make it out alive, or will the madness overcome you—causing you to be a patient of the Ashford Asylum forever?",2-8,60,Difficult,Scary,,None
