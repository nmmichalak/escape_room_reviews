In an attempt to salvage their luck, they mutinied against the Captain, throwing his love into the sea. Unfortunately, a worse fate awaited them; a wrathful storm brewed overhead, washing their ship ashore... and no living souls were left onboard.
Your crew comes across the wreck, gathers courage and decides to venture onto the damned vessel. Now, what you must do is find the treasure and escape the ship before you are cursed too...",2-12,60,Difficult,Not scary,7+,None
