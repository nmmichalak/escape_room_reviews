Weren't we surprised at the reading of her will when we found out that she had left her fortune to her cat?! That fortune is OURS! OURS, I say!
So, we've hired you, a team of crack cat burglars to break into Great Auntie's house and find her fortune and bring it to us. Be quick though, because once you enter Great Auntie's house, the alarm will alert the police and they will be there in exactly 60 minutes to arrest you!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
