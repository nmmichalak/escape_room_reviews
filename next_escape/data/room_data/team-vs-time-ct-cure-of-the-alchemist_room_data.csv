As the plague doctor, they depend on your curesâ€¦ but your best efforts are proving less fruitful each day. There is, however, another way. A local alchemist, said to have otherworldly powers, is rumored to have concocted an elixir that can cure any ailment. Attempts to persuade him to share his potion have been unsuccessful.

But can a bottle of the priceless potion be gotten by other means? Even the alchemist must sleep sometime. Armed only with candlelight and resourcefulness, you will have just one hour to explore the apothecary and, if you are lucky, steal a bottle of the elixir.
