"Escape room ""Abandoned: The Story of House 901"" by Greeley's Great Escape in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/greeleys-great-escape-abandoned-the-story-of-house-901,"901 35th Ave A, Greeley, CO 80634","The abandoned house at 901 sat lonely and empty since the early 1950’s. The single family home, with it’s empty windows and silent halls attracted attention from local children and teens over the years. 

Locals often call it haunted but every so often someone was dared to go inside, however, it wasn’t rare for the person to disappear completely. Or worse, come out gibbering nonsense and failing to gain their mind back afterwards. 

But why? What could be so horrendous inside that people’s sanity crumbled? You and your friends have decided to find out. You’ve gathered every scrap of evidence you could get your hand on, and discovered little. The last family to live there were Jane and Jerald Robinson, a happy couple with children. A news article you had dug up detailed a strange exit from the home. No packing was done. No pre-planned moving. It was as if they had suddenly fled in the middle of the night. 

Even stranger still, though the article talked about 2 children, it only mentioned a son. Why did this family leave and why is only one child identified?

Your fearless group has decided to answer these questions for yourselves. Stepping foot on the property. In the window, a light flickers, and the sound of a girl’s high-pitched giggle echoes as you open the front door. Will you discover where this ghostly giggle originates?

 Or will you too, become it’s victim?

Are you brave enough to go into the house at 901?",2-8,60,Average,Scary,14+,None
