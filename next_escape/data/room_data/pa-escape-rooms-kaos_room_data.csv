"Escape room ""KAOS"" by PA Escape Rooms in Scranton",https://worldofescapes.com/scranton/quests/pa-escape-rooms-kaos,"350 Main Street Dickson City, PA 18519","In recent months, a mysterious serial killer who identifies himself as ‘The Revolutionary’ committed four ghastly murders around the United States. Today, more victims have been captured, and are currently being held in a closet in his makeshift lair. /p>

Always one step ahead, The Revolutionary set a trap just inside his front door, and now the rescuers are also trapped in a closet in the lair. In 60 minutes, The Revolutionary will return to commit his fifth gruesome crime, unless the victims and rescuers can escape the serial killer’s lair!
This is not a scary escape room (just a little creepy).",2-10,60,Average,None,,None
