You are Gerard ""Gerry"" Droller, a CIA Field Operative, your code name is Don Frederico and you work directly for the President of the United States, J.F. Kennedy.

While going over your mission notes, you realize the world is facing a nuclear Armageddon. The Soviet Union, under Premier Nikita Kruschev, has strategically assigned ballistic nuclear missiles to the Cuban territory with approval from the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.

These missiles are located less than 100 miles from the U.S and are able to reach major cities with only a 4 minute flight time. The atmosphere is extremely tense!

An American spy plane has just been shot down over Cuba and the President is now under massive pressure from the Pentagon to launch an invasion of Cuba. The President, however, isn’t sure whether the plane was shot down deliberately by the Cubans or the Soviets, or if this was a terrible accident by a lowly soldier.

If this was indeed an accident, there is no need to go to war, and a peaceful solution may still be possible. If this was a deliberate action, then the President has no choice but to launch a U.S. invasion of Cuba, which could result in a nuclear war.

However, having entered the Palace, you receive word that Castro and his bodyguards are traveling back towards the palace, and they are only 60 minutes away! You must complete your mission and escape before you are caught!

Solve the clues, answer the riddles, find the critical intelligence and get out within the hour. Rely on your intuition, have confidence in your team and leave no stone unturned! Remember: Your mind is your most powerful weapon and time is of the essence! Do you have what it takes to complete your mission?",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,5+,None
