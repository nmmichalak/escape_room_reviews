Don't get too comfortable: your execution is set in exactly 60 minutes.
Due to overcrowding, the Warden has been forced to temporarily place you in the old E-Block. The guards say it was closed over 40 years ago due to a gas leak. But some of the old-timers say that it really had to do with a prisoner who escaped and was never found. Nobody knows how he pulled it off.
Are the rumors true? Did someone really break out? Is there a secret way out? Can you escape before your time is up and the guards come back to get you?",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,8+,0.3
