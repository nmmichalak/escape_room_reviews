During a meeting, your team receives a video message from one of the President's top advisors. A foreign power has launched a coordinated attack on America. The President has been incapacitated and an onslaught of nuclear warheads are heading for America's most populated areas.
The very room you meet in contains the means to launch the USA's anti-missile defense system to intercept the warheads. Unfortunately, the video feed with the advisor cuts off before he can explain how to activate the system. Your team has one hour to figure out how to stop the attack before disaster strikes America.",2-6,60,Easy,Not scary,13+,0.6
