"Escape room ""Ransom"" by Entrap Games in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/Entrap-Games-Ransom,"7905 L Street, Suite 110, Omaha, NE 68127","The last thing you remember is heading down the hallway on your way to bed before the lights went out. You’ve woken up blindfolded and handcuffed in a very odd and small cell. The kidnappers have asked for a ransom, but there is no guarantee that they'll let you go even if you pay them! It’s up to you to crawl through a series of clues in search of a quick escape before they return with your fate.
This game room requires some physical activity and may be difficult for players that are unable to kneel, crawl, or jump.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.38
