"Escape room ""Blood Shed"" by Escape Room Entertainment in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-room-entertainment-blood-shed,"604 E New Haven Ave, Melbourne, FL 32901","“It’s summer and fear is starting to settle over the city like a blanket.  The whispers started a few weeks ago. And are growing to a dull roar, as speculation starts on the people missing. 

You and a group of friends are determined not to let your summer go to waste, living in fear of the unknown.  You make plans to go hang out in Downtown Melbourne, where a number of people have gone missing. There hasn’t been a disappearance in weeks, and you are confident that being in a group together will help protect you from harm. 

You and your friends have enjoyed dinner, and are headed out on the seemingly empty streets to a usually crowded bar, that stands deserted, to grab drinks before you head home.  A van pulls out in front of your group – and before anyone knows what is happening, it all goes black. 

You awaken into what can only be deemed a nightmare. It seems this madman has taken you into a shed of nightmares. Your fears are confirmed and you realize that you and your friends are the next victims of this psychopath. 

You are restrained in a dark room – you hear the key scraping the lock, and a voice talking on a phone, discussing plans to kill you when he returns in an hour.  You hope you have time to escape this hell before he returns.”",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,14+,None
