"Escape room ""Humana Festum"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-humana-festum,"12909 Foothill Blvd Sylmar, CA 91342","A serial killer cocktail soiree where you play mini escape rooms while you imbibe and mingle!

By now, you all know about our prolific serial killer, Edward Tandy and he and his mother's plans to rid the world of those who lack... the wherewithal to save themselves. Additionally, over the years, Edward has accumulated ""followers"" that he has deemed the ""proven few"". Edward and his cohorts have grown tired of spending their days on the Tandy property alone and have invited you to a special cocktail party known as Humana Festum.

At Humana Festum, you will be treated to the finest of spirits Tandy has to offer, as well as the chance to visit the four corners of Edward's mind, where you will have to find remnants from his memories and use them to solve yet another one of his twisted games. Only this time, the reward is much greater - you may get a chance to meet Edward himself.

Humana Festum is an immersive event with 6 performers where you will solve 4 mini escape rooms before combining everything you've collected in order to finish a larger over-arching game. Once you've completed the game, you are free to hang out as long as you like to converse with other escape room and horror enthusiasts alike. Feel free to take photos and videos with our performers while you participate!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,18+,None
