The FBI just received a video message from mad environmental science student Seymour Green, who will deploy a bioweapon weapon tonight destroying California’s population. We need you and up to five more of your fellow agents to break into his lab and discover where, when, and how this weapon will be deployed–and if you can, stop it.
