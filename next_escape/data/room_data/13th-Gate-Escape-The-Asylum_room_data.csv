"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-Gate-Escape-The-Asylum,"800 St Phillip St, Baton Rouge, LA 70802","With an alleged 7000 deaths taking place inside its walls, the old abandoned avery island asylum is up to it's eyeballs in spirits, not surprisingly topping lists of america's most haunted spots.
Originally built as a tuberculosis hospital in 1913, the building saw many die from the disease. But with the addition of mentally unstable criminals and the mentally handicapped in 1919, the facility became severly understaffed and soon tales of mistreatment and dubious human experimentation trickled out.

Many believe the murderous owner of the facility, Doctor Victor Delacroix, was to blame claiming he kept patients as hostages to perform gruesome experiments and medical procedures on them. It was not until HIS mysterious murder in 1931 by several of the patients that an investigation was launched and the facility was finally shut down for good.

Apparations include Beaux Davis (aka ""Mouse""), a small girl who leaves her toys lying around and who's been caught on camera, a nurse who hanged herself in the central hallways and can still be heard yelling at her patients, hundreds of scattered screams of tortured souls throughout the facility, and the murderous ghost of the doctor himself, who is said to still walk the halls, searching for his next victim.

Your friend Jenny, a local reporter, broke into the old asylum this evening in the hopes of capturing footage for a story she was working on about haunted places. She's been gone for awhile and it's getting dark and a storm is coming, so you and your friends decide to go look for her. You hesitantly enter through a broken window and start searching through the maze of dark rooms. You enter an old patient room when suddenly you hear the door lock behind you, trapping you inside.
 
Can you find your friend and escape or will you become the doctor's next patient?",4-8,60,Difficult,Scary,8+,None
