Castles, palaces, and museums were wiped out. These collections would later come to be known as ""imperial treasures.""
After generations, these ""imperial treasures"" are divided ""eight pieces"", with Hitler of course receiving the largest share. His vault, built in 1938 at Lashitaner, was nicknamed ""Wolfenstein.""
