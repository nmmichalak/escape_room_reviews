Academy Blvd Colorado Springs, CO 80917","A world-renowned expert in historical artifacts, Professor Martin Alabaster has gone missing! You've recently asked him to consult on an expedition to find a fabled relic of a long-forgotten civilization.
You've just received a very strange call from the professor, claiming that he has found it, with the line going silent abruptly. Confused and quite rattled, you gather your team and race to the professor’s home. Nothing seems out of place, so you enter his study.
The door closes behind you and a recording begins to play. “I can’t take any chances that the wrong people made it here first. You have 60 minutes before the room fills with a corrosive gas destroying everything including the occupants. Should you manage to survive you’ll not only find me but the location of the relic.”",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
