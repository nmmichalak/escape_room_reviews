That is the last thing you remember that night. The next day you wake aboard the huge 3-masted 800-ton Chinese ship called the Keying that has set sail on the arduous and risk-filled journey to the United States and Britain around the perilous Cape Horn. You quickly realize that you have been fooled by the King of the Crimps, Joseph 'Bunko' Kelly and forcefully drafted to work with the ships' company of 12 British and 30 Cantonese sailors.

Ahead lies months, if not years, of dangerous, unhealthy, unsanitary conditions with little hope of pay. After weeks on the open sea, an impending storm drives the ship to seek refuge on a small island known to the locals as Samui. While in the ship’s mess hall, you start to hear a familiar sea song: “Way ay up she rises, way ay up she rises, way ay up she rises early in the morning.” The crew is starting to prepare the ship to set sail! Looking around the room, you make eye contact with a few of your shipmates, everyone quickly realizes, now is your only chance to escape! The Keying will set sail again in an hour as the tide waits for no man.
