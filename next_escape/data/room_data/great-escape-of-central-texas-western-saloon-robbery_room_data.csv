Central Texas Expy Killeen, TX 76543","This is Tombstone....this is the old west!  Here, the law has more than they can handle and the criminals give 'em plenty.  Milt Joyce, owner/operator of the Oriental Saloon, has died and in the old west, there are no wills.  What does that mean for you and your band of outlaws?  Rumor has it that Milt left a fortune of gold behind for the taking and in these here parts, that's invitation enough.  But hurry, you aren't the only thieves gunning for the gold.",2-7,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
