As their fame spread across the land, their very oddly creative siblings became jealous of the Grimm brothers. They decided to start writing children’s books themselves. In their first release, they inadvertently exposed secrets of The Moon Howlers, a inept local wolf pack. 
Infuriated, the gang’s leader Fang, vowed to seek revenge on the entire town. After wreaking havoc late one night, the pack took several townspeople into the surrounding enchanted forest. Your job is to sneak past the wolf pack and rescue the hostages while avoiding the mysteries of the enchanted forest.
