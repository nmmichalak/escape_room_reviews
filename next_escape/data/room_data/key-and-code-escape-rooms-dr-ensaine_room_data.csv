"Escape room ""Dr. Ensaine"" by Key and Code Escape Rooms in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/key-and-code-escape-rooms-dr-ensaine,"1420 Scheels Drive Suite E-108 Sparks, NV 89434","A local dentist, Dr. Ensaine, has been renting a space from you for his thriving dental practice. Lately, though you've been noticing a change in his routine and becoming suspicious. He's been staying very late at night... and some of the patients who have been entering the office don't seem to be exiting!
The sounds coming out of his suite are NOT those of a typical dental office! Instead of the usual suction and cleaning noises, the sounds of drilling and grinding followed by terrified screams and moans fill the air. And was that a chainsaw you heard just now? Something is definitely wrong.
You've observed that each night the Doctor leaves for an hour and then returns. Tonight's the night... you decide to seize the opportunity to sneak into his office and see what he's been up to! But you've got to work quickly... he'll be back in 60 minutes and if he returns and finds you there... you may never come out alive!",3-10,60,Average,Scary,10+,None
