"Escape room ""Framed"" by Epoch Escapes in Jefferson City",https://worldofescapes.com/jefferson-city/quests/epoch-escapes-framed,"3600 Country Club Dr #318 Jefferson City, MO 65109","You and your group were on your way to check out what is rumored to be the BEST escape room in town, when you were dramatically pulled over by several police cars. Things happened pretty fast after that, now you’re in central booking… evidently you match the description of some fugitives that have been accused of undisclosed crimes throughout Jefferson City. But you didn’t do it! Civil disobedience isn’t usually your thing, but this is ridiculous. The guard has stepped out. Use your wits to find your way out before the guard returns!
