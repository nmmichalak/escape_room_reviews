Eldorado Ste 100 Bloomington, IL 61704","You're late, you're late for a very important date! The Queen is demanding an audience with you in sixty minutes and not one minute later. The last person who was late for a meeting with her majesty was....well lets just say heads rolled that day. On your way to the Queen’s castle you stumble across a strange man in a large hat having what appears to be a Party in the middle of the woods. You explain you are on your way to meet the queen and cannot be late, but the man will not take no for an answer.
