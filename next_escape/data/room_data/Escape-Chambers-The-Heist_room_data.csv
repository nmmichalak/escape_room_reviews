"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Heist,"275 W Wisconsin Ave #2040, Milwaukee, WI 53203","You're halfway done. You lifted the diamonds, successfully managed to hide them inside of the small wooden sculpture, and got out of France without any issues. Good thing U.S.Customs doesn't check traveling pieces of art near as carefully as other goods entering the country. All you have left to do is break into the gallery and get them out of the sculpture.
Why did things have to turn complicated? The heist was supposed to begin tomorrow night...fortunately, Donovan, your team leader, read between the lines. The brains behind this whole thing were never going to let us walk free with their goods...they need a scapegoat and your team fit the bill.
Solution: Take it back before they have a chance to set you up. Donovan left the briefcase with the tools in the adjacent retail space, next to the gallery. You don't have time for some elaborate plan, so you're going to have to do a lot, with a little. Get the goods and get out... or maybe spend the rest of your lives in prison.",2-12,60,Average,None,,None
