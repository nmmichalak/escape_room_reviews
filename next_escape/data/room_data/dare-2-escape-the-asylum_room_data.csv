Throughout the years, there were many reports of strange, unexplained noises in the hallways, screams in the night, locked doors opening mysteriously, and sightings of malicious entities roaming the grounds.
You are there to conduct an investigation in the very same room of a patient by the name of Victoria Sneed to determine her fate. As you and your team are investigating Victoriaâ€™s abandoned room in hopes to make contact with her, the door slams shut and locks you in from the outside.
