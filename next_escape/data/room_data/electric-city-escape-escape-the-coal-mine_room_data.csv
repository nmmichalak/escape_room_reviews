You're covered in coal dust, and have already worked a twelve-hour day. Finally, the whistle blows for 6 o’clock.  As you’re preparing to go home, you hear a large explosion. You were all supposed to be at the secret meeting of the Molly Maguires tonight to discuss the Shenandoah Bridge plot. The mine bosses must have found out and blown the entrance to the mine. Now, you must find your way out before the invisible gas, methane, consumes your lungs. You only have about an hour of oxygen left. Fortunately, as miners, you prepare for these types of events.  There is another way out, but you’re not going to like it- Dead Rock Run.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
