You are a Union officer based in Columbus, Ohio and are tasked with uncovering Confederate Sympathizers in the North. Ever since Brigadier General John Morgan entered Union territory with his Calvary, things have been busy. Yesterday he was successful in crossing over into Ohio and began conducting raids of homes. He is posing such a threat that General Burnside declared Martial Law in Cincinnati. Things have gotten crazyâ€¦ some rumors even say he is on the way to Columbus!

This morning you received a tip about the home and stables of a local barrister whose family is originally from Charleston, South Carolina. It is reported that the stables have been very busy at all times of day and night, and it is suspected that Southern dispatches are being routed through the home, possibly even top secret letters to Morgan himself. You discover that the family attends a special service at church every week, and this potentially creates an opportunity for you to search their home without compromising additional intelligence by arresting the family. Can you get in the home, and find information on where General Morgan is headed and any secret documents stores here before the family returns from service? Capturing General Morgan and his men could be the beginning of the end for the Confederacy!",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,8+,0.4
