Olive Ave West Palm Beach, FL 33401","Classes at the Boca Baton School of Magic and Wizardry were unusual and slightly dangerous.  Why should your final exam be any different?  To graduate, you must find the Ancient Crystal of the Druids and restore it to its’ rightful owner.  It will take teamwork and all the magical powers you’ve learned to pass this one last test.  Succeed and you will graduate top of your class.  Fail and you will be washing brooms for the rest of your life. ",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
