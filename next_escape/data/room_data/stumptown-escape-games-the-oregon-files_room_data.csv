Every holiday he would regale you with tales about your home state of Oregon. UFO's, Sasquatch, D.B. Cooper, some kind of Vortex, there seemed to be no limit to the weirdness.
To say you were surprised to get a panicked call from him would be an understatement, what he said during that call outright shocked you. Now, you have 60 minutes to find the evidence in his cabin which has him on the run and get out before the feds raid the place.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,10+,None
