After meeting the parents and the child for the first time they leave for the night telling you they’d be back early the next morning. You wish them well and go about your time watching the child.
Watching TV, you doze off until you hear a blood-curdling scream. You jump up and look around to get your bearings. You then run up the stairs to Mary’s room. You enter the toy room that leads to Mary’s room and crib but as soon as you get inside the door shuts behind you. You try to open it but it is locked and you hear the scream coming from Mary’s room.
You’ll now have an hour to try and save little Mary and get out of the room or else be trapped forever!",2-10,60,Difficult,A little scary,,0.35
