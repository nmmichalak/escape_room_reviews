Things were going smoothly until a sudden storm rolled in. Your fancy yacht has taken significant damage and is on the verge of going under.
Luckily, an island is spotted nearby. You manage to get ashore just in time. After hiking in search of shelter for what seems like hours, your group comes across what appears to be a camp hidden deep within the island jungle.
It quickly becomes apparent that this is no ordinary campsite: this is a smugglers den! Amongst the stolen loot is a jet ski. Can you find the key and escape the island before the criminals return?",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
