Ever since you were a kid, you have been interested in Paranormal activity – and you have seen some stuff that is…well..downright inexplicable. The Laughton Hotel has stories that make your hair stand on end. The Supernatural energy surrounding the hotel is palpable. Most paranormal investigators have declined the offer of exploring these old buildings, but your curiosity got the better of you. Find the secret elevator, get it working, and take it to Floor 23 and get proof the place is truly haunted. And if you believe the superstitions, be sure get out before midnight, as local legend has it that any living thing caught in the hotel at the stroke of midnight becomes part of the spirit world, and gets trapped in the hotel forever!",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,18+,None
