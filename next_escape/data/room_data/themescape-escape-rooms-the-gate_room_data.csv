We have learned the door that has been discovered is a gateway to a curse that will unleash darkness upon the world. A top secret military department has now constructed a device around the gate to protect the world from the powers that lie beyond its threshold. With every minute that passes by, the device grows weaker as the curse becomes stronger. Now we must crack the code, enter the tomb, and finally put the curse to rest.",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,14+,None
