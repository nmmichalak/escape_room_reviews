"Escape room ""Wizard Escape"" by Unity Escape Rooms in Redlands",https://worldofescapes.com/redlands/quests/unity-escape-rooms-wizard-escape,"2015 W Park Ave Suite 2B Redlands, CA 92373","For centuries, the three most powerful magical groups have lived in harmony. The hard-nosed and hot-headed Drekians, masters of the dragons, the proud and often hard-headed Ulfurics, masters of the wolves and finally, the cunning and secretive Snakurians, masters of the snakes.
Together, these three groups have shaped their magical world how they saw fit. There have been disagreements over the years, but logic and wisdom always prevailed. That was, until the current leader of the Drekians, Lars Darkonian, received a vision while staring into the eye of the dragon. In this vision, he saw the one thing that could give him what he coveted most: power above all others. He saw the Cup of Destiny.
The wizard that drank from this cup would become the ruler of all. The cup was in the possession of the Ulfurics. Lars knew what he had to do and in a daring nighttime raid, the Drekians stormed the Ulfuric Den and stole the cup. Horrified by the events that transpired the Ulfuric leader, Artemis Nightbane spoke with Sylvanas Tiamat, the leader of the Snakurians and together they decided that the matter was far too dangerous to ignore. The Cup of Destiny in the hands of Lars Darkonian would spell certain doom for their world they had worked so hard to build.
Both leaders have gathered a team of wizards to invade the Drekian Lair to retrieve and ultimately destroy the cup. The task is now yours to fulfill. You must raid their lair, find the cup, and escape in time. The fate of the world is in your hands.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,0.5
