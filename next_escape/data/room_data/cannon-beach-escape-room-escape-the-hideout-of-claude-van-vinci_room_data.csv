Marge Hemlock, Camp Director at Camp Haystack, has caught you planning a prank that would make you a camp legend. She has the evidence in her footlocker and is planning to call you parents and ban you from camp as soon as she is back...in just one hour.

But you’re in luck! There’s a camp rumour that a while back some campers hid a series of clues that will let you get the evidence and escape her cabin. If you succeed she’ll have no way to prove it was you. If you fail, she’ll call your parents and you’ll be in big trouble.
