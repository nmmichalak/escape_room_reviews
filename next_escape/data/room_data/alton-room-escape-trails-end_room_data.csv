"Escape room ""Trail's End"" by Alton Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/alton-room-escape-trails-end,"319 Ridge St., Alton, IL 62002","Your group has been hiking all day and it was so beautiful you lost track of time and are utterly lost in the wilderness! Now, it's an hour before sunset when the park will be closing. You know it's hopeless to try to hike back out by yourselves, and you need to find a way to contact the Ranger's Station since there is no cell service.
Fortunately, you have stumbled across the Trail's End Cabin, available for public use, which has a 2-way radio to contact the rangers for rescue. The only problem is some pranksters have hidden the radio which you must find, along with the correct channel and passcode so the rangers know you are not just another prank call at the end of the day!

â€‹If you can't contact the rangers before they head home, you'll be stuck in the wilderness all night... tired, hungry, and thirsty!",4-12,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.33
