The general public has been told that Oak Ridge National Laboratory has been shifted to civilian control and has been winding down production of any more atomic bombs, however, this information has not made it to the Communist ears.
Russia has launched an early prototype of their Tsar Bomba hydrogen bomb and will impact the Oak Ridge, TN area in 60 minutes. The emergency broadcast network urges everyone to seek shelter immediately to avoid the deadly blast and radiation. Frantically looking for shelter, you find an old rundown farmhouse. The door is locked, obviously, the owner didn't want strangers to use his house!
Players must find the keys to unlock the shelter, get inside, and seal the door shut before the bomb detonates.",2-8,60,Difficult,A little scary,6+,None
