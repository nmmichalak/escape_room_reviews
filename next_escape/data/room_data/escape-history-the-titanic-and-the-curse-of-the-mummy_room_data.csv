"Escape room ""The Titanic and the Curse of the Mummy"" by Escape History in Warren",https://worldofescapes.com/warren-oh/quests/escape-history-the-titanic-and-the-curse-of-the-mummy,"5580 Youngstown Warren Rd #1 Niles, OH 44446","While aboard the Titanic, you and your party get word that the famous archaeological couple, Sir Mortimer Wheeler and Tessa Verney, are traveling first class and transporting a few Ancient Egyptian artifacts to a museum in the United States. One of those artifacts includes the sarcophagus and mummy of Egyptian Pharaoh, Ahman-Ra’s princess. Supposedly, there is too much moisture in the cargo hold, therefore, these artifacts are being held in the Wheeler’s first-class room, under his close supervision.
Your party decides to sneak into their room while they are at dinner followed by ballroom dancing on the night of April 14th. While examining some of the artifacts more closely, you discover a hidden note. You read through the detailed account of the history of the mummy and discover it has a horrible past. In fact, a curse follows this mummy, bringing misfortune and even death to those who have come in contact with it.
You hear the door mysteriously lock, you’ve found out her secret, and now find yourself stuck inside this room with the Cursed Princess, Ahman Ra. You and your party will need to break this ancient curse and escape before something bad happens to you, or even worse, all of the passengers on the ship.",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
