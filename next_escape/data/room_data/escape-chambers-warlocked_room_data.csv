"Escape room ""Warlocked"" by Escape Chambers in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/escape-chambers-warlocked,"338 SW 6th St Des Moines, IA 50309","The lines between worlds have become blurred. Hidden behind a veil of spells and enchantment, exists a society of witches and wizards, balanced against the rest of the natural world...hidden, that is, until now.
Due to unexplained circumstances, non-magical individuals have been falling ill and dying over the past few months. As the body count continues to rise, you must assemble your team to halt the plague now facing both worlds.
A nefarious wizard, known only as Xerath, has placed a number of cursed paintings around the globe, draining the life force of those unfortunate enough to gaze upon them. It is believed that this energy is then siphoned into a ""host"" painting.
We have reason to believe that the ""host"" is being held in a private underground vault, inside of a secured facility operated by a powerful goblin race proficient in ""technomancy."" Using a dangerous mixture of ancient magical defenses and cutting edge high tech security, you and your team must navigate through the vault, find the ""host,"" and escape before the cloaking spell wears off and you find yourself face-to-face with a dark wizard of unmatched power.
There are two identical rooms at the location that can be played as dueling chambers. Both rooms can accomodate up to six people.",2-12,60,Average,Not scary,,None
