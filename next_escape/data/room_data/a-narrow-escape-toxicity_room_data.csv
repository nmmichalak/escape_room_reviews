"Escape room ""Toxicity"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-toxicity,"1502 N Semoran Blvd Suite 160 Orlando, FL 32807","You have been kidnapped by Vladimir, a Russian sadist who is known for holding people hostage for months while releasing various gasses into a confined bunker to test the effects on the human mind. When Vladimir grows tired of playing mind games, he releases a toxic gas known as Phosgene which creates a deep Psychosis. From there, the body starts shutting down as the user's organs slowly and painfully stop working; starting with the lungs.
Vladimir loves games, and you are his new challenger. He has given you an hour to find the switch that isolates the gas. If you win, the Phosgene will instead flood into Vladimir's chambers and end his sadistic challenges for good. It's your life, or his. Good luck, and remember, Vladimir has never lost a game.",2-8,60,Very difficult,A little scary,,0.14
