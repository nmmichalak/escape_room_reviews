You stumble upon a cabin in the woods. With little water left and no more food, you enter the cabin seeking shelter until sunrise. The cabin is far beyond what you expect; it's more than a mere dwelling; it’s four forest walls with stories, secrets and much, much more. The last wanderers did not make it out. Do not let this cabin swallow you too. Get whatever you need and get the heck out!",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,14+,None
