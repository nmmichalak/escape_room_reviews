"Escape room ""Gold Rush 1849"" by Time Escape Loveland in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/time-escape-loveland-gold-rush-1849,"770 N Lincoln Ave Loveland, CO 80537","Gold miner Jedediah Taylor is one of the most ruthless treasure-seekers in California’s Gold Rush of 1849, doing anything to find pay dirt. His gold-fevered soul is stingy and malicious, and if you try to jump his claim you’ll meet your untimely end, just like the gamblers and thieves who tried before you. This reclusive 49er lives alone in a remote cabin hidden deep in the dank, dark woods. Word is that old Jed has quite a stash of gold hiding in his humble abode.
Today you finally found his cabin...EUREKA! When Jed steps outside to go prospecting for those glorious nuggets you sneak inside. To your surprise, the door shuts and locks behind you. If Jed catches you up to your shenanigans you’ll be just a flash in the pan! If you're smart you'll find the gold, but if you're brilliant you'll get out before you get caught.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
