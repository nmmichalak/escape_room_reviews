"Escape room ""The Scientist"" by Trapped Downtown in Hastings",https://worldofescapes.com/hastings/quests/trapped-downtown-the-toy-room,"229 N. St Joseph Ave Hastings, NE 68901","Noted entomologist Dr. Husen has selected you to work with him as a graduate assistant in his lab. Over the years, his research has led to the successful identification and treatment of numerous insect-borne infectious diseases. His experience is needed now more than ever though since a new mystery pandemic has swept across the southeast killing millions and infecting hundreds of thousands more…including Dr. Husen! 
You believe that the answers to this new disease may be found in his lab, but you don’t even know where to start. What is it? How is it being transmitted? What are the signs and symptoms? Can it be treated? You’ll need to think fast because the hospital informed you that he has just been taken off of life support and only has “about 60 minutes left.” Find the answers, save the scientist!
