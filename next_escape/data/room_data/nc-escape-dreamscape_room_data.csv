"Escape room ""Dreamscape"" by NC Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/nc-escape-dreamscape,"119 Orange Street, Durham, NC 27701","Dreamscape is a next-generation game built for both new and experienced players. Based on a simulated VR experiment, it immerses players in an environment which is technically challenging and inclined to electronic puzzles over physical locks. Dreamscape requires no outside knowledge and has a variety of puzzles that require teamwork, just like our other games, but those who have played before may still find that it subverts their expectations (in a good way, we hope!).
