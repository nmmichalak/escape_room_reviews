It is now February 22nd, 1779 and the War for Independence continues. You and your fellow Partisans have just been informed that Commander George Rogers Clark will arrive with a significant force in the next day or two to attack and retake Fort Sackville on the Wabash River.
You've been asked to find black powder stores to conduct the battle. You are already certain about where a good amount is located… in the weapons cache of Fort Sackville itself! One of your party has a covert method of getting into Commander Henry Hamilton’s office at Fort Sackville. It is your understanding that his office is somehow connected to the weapons store. Find the black powder and escape the Fort within 60 minutes and you may help secure the western territory for your fledgling nation.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,8+,0.4
