The famous North Diamond was on loan to the Electric City Museum and displayed in the Slocum Wing. A competing team of spies already attempted to steal it. Unfortunately for them, they were caught, and the diamond was never recovered. That’s where you come in! We have figured out that the thieves have hidden the diamond somewhere in the Fine Art Wing of the museum. We know they have left some clues for their team to find it. Your mission is to complete what the other team couldn’t! Disarm the alarm, use your skills, and follow the clues that the thieves left behind to find the diamond before the guards return on their hourly check. You have 60 minutes, starting… now!
