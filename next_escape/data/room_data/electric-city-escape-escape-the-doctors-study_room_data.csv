His study stores all his research, holds his inventions, and is the place where he conducts his experiments. Which is why you are here today; to witness his latest experiment. At least this is what you were expecting. As it turns out, the doctor is running late, and someone in your group must have knocked over some test tubes. Suddenly, the doctor comes over a speaker and announces to the group the NEPA Virus has been released! He quarantines your group in the study. Apparently, without the antidote, the virus will take hold in only 60 minutes. Your group will have to find the cure in the study before it’s too late! There will be some challenges as the crazy doctor’s inventions cause some difficulties, the clues are locked up, and you will have to find the cure before everyone is “NEPAtised” forever!",6-16,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
