"Escape room ""The Mad Doctor"" by Escape Games Live in York",https://worldofescapes.com/york/quests/escape-games-live-the-mad-doctor,"237 W Market St York, PA 17401","Dear Prospective Scientist of UMAD:

If you are receiving this it is because you have qualified for your final exam to graduate from UMAD. Your dedication to the scientific disciplines has been extraordinary and the way you handled that escaped Garflak from the quadrupedal sciences wing will have 
instructors talking for years!

You and the other qualified candidates will endure a grueling set of devious tests to prove you have learned what you need to be a truly productive scientist in the world.  You will need all of your wits, fortitude, instincts and if things go badly all of your alumni donations to get through this exam. Pass and you have graduated. Good luck. 

Sincerely,
Professor Ulysses William Hertz",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,0.41
