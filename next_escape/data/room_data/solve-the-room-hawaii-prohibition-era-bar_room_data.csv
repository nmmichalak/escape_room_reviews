"Escape room ""Prohibition Era Bar"" by Solve the Room Hawaii in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/solve-the-room-hawaii-prohibition-era-bar,"1722 Kalakaua Ave Honolulu, HI 96826","It is 1924 during the Prohibition Era, and you are hanging out with some friends at a speakeasy (an illegal bar) in Chicago when all of a sudden Al Capone walks in! You and your friends watch in utter surprise as Capone walks up to a guy and shoots him 6 times then leaves. (The victim, Howard, was shot by Capone because he assaulted Capone's friend).
The cops are called - they rush in as everyone scrambles to run away or hide. No one wants to be caught in an illegal bar. You end up hiding in the bathroom.
Eventually, the bar is locked up and closed with you and your friends trapped inside; but not for long! You and everyone else hiding in the bar need to find a way out in 60 minutes before the cops come back searching for stragglers and witnesses.",1-6,60,Difficult,A little scary,12+,0.35
