We've sent people in, but as of yet, no one's come out. We believe there is an ancient relic that is making them vanish. Can you retrieve the relic before you vanish like everyone else?
There are two identical rooms available at the location, each for 2-6 players.",2-6,60,Very difficult,Not scary,10+,None
