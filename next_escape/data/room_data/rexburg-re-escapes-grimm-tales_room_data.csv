While walking through the woods to verify some rumors of an enchanted tree, you are kidnapped by a witch. She traps you in her cottage. Her plans? To skin, roast and devour you. But first she needs to collect enough herbs and spices to stuff you all with. She grumbles, as she walks out the door that it would take an entire hour to collect herbs. If you can escape the witch's hut and all of her enchantments, you will have quite the story to tell the Brother's Grimm. If you can't, your tongues may tell a different tale from the view of a dinner plate.",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,15+,None
