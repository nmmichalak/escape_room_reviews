The great Chocolate Factory closed its doors forever.
The town was in a frenzy to take over his delicious treats but the doors to the factory seemed to be unbreakable until one day you and your friends discovered a series of clues left just outside the factory. Your mission is to get into the factory, get it up and running, and retrieve the master’s newest creations.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,0.65
