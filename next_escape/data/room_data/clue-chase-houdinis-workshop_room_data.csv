"Escape room ""Houdini's Workshop"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-houdinis-workshop,"39 W 32nd St 4th Floor New York, NY 10001",October 31st 1926 – Harry Houdini has died. Famous for his skepticism of self-proclaimed “mystics” Houdini was famous for taking part in seances in order to debunk these charlatans. Clue Chase Labs believes that Houdini was holding these events in order to search for the only real source of mystic power in this world – The Artifact. With his passing we must ensure that any research or discoveries he made during his time on earth do not fall into the wrong hands. You have one hour to search his workshop for anything concerning the artifact. Good luck. ,1-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
