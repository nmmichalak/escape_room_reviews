You have lost count of the days that have gone by. You noticed that Thursday's jail warden spends an extra 60 mins at dinner due to his gambling habits. This gave you a glimmer of hope to escape.
Recently, new inmates have been locked up next door. You can hear murmuring about ""inside man"" and ""decode messages"". Thursday is probably the only chance for you to escape. Will you and fellow inmates come up with a plan to find a way out, or will the death penalty come and find you first?",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,0.52
