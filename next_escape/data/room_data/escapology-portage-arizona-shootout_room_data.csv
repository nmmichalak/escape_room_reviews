"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology Portage in Portage",https://worldofescapes.com/portage/quests/escapology-portage-arizona-shootout,"5600 Portage Road, Portage, MI 49002","It’s 2:55 in the afternoon, you, Wyatt Earp, and three other marshals are sitting inside the O.K. Corral Saloon discussing the latest series of crimes that are blamed on the local cowboy outlaws. This group of outlaws are known for their violent criminal history. You and the other lawmen have had several previous confrontations with this group.

While, you, your brothers Virgil and Morgan, and your best friend Doc Holliday are devising a plan to round up the cowboy outlaws, the townspeople start screaming. Immediately, you all know something bad is about to happen.

Looking out from the window of the saloon, you see 5 outlaws riding into town on their horses and heading toward the saloon, including the notorious Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury.

When Billy and Frank draw their pistols, you know it is going to be a fight for your life. You draw and fire in defence of your own life, the lives of your brothers, and Doc Holliday. In a cloud of dust and gun smoke, chaos ensues. You shoot your gun until you run out of bullets!

The whole shoot out takes only 30 seconds - the most terrifying 30 seconds of your life! After the dust settles, 3 bodies lay in front of you. Quickly, you notice two of your people are injured but the rest are unharmed. The marshals have won the fight!

However, there is some bad news: the other 2 outlaws are no where to be found. The marshals must quickly identify who has been shot and who is on the run. You will have 60 minutes to complete this task or the 2 outlaws will surely escape to Mexico!

Find the clues, solve the puzzles, pick the locks, find the names of the guilty suspects and get out of the saloon within the hour.

Rely on your intuition, have confidence in your team and leave no stone unturned! Remember, as you always say: “Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything. In a gunfight… you need to take your time in a hurry!” Do you have what it takes to complete your mission?",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
