It happened faster than we all expected. Russ Coleman, one of the survivors and microbiologist, managed to set up a small lab. After receiving word from government officials, and performing some tests, Russ was able to create a working vaccine. His vault lost power and stopped responding. A radio signal went out to a nearby vault. To find the survivors, they sent a message to the “South” vault.

We don’t have much time to send your team to find out what happened to the vault to the north. Remember your objective is to get the vaccine to save the world!",2-8,60,Very difficult,A little scary,12+,0.2
