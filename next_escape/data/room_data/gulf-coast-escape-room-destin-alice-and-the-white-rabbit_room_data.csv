You decide to follow her, and see her go into a hole near a giant resting tree. You call out to her, but get no response. You go to inspect the tree, and call out again. Suddenly you lose your footing and end up falling for a what seems like small eternity. Suddenly you are now Wonderland. Your goal is to get out in 45 minutes and free Alice from the Queen of Hearts before you both lose your heads.",2-10,45,Average,Not scary,,None
