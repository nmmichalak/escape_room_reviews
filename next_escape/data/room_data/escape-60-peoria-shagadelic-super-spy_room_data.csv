He has recovered the nuclear missile that the Doctor had stolen and has hidden it in his very “shagadelic” London pad.
Now Doctor E has captured your British friend and is going to set the missile off remotely in 60 minutes. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to find and disarm the missile and get out of our hero’s high security pad before the Doctor sets it off in exactly one hour.
