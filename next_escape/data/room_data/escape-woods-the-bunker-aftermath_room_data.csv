The virus was only released a few days ago but it has already spread to much of the world's population. In its wake the virus is turning everyone infected into mindless, blood thirsty shells of their former selves. In the aftermath, civilization is beginning to break down and humanity is crumbling. 
Not much is known about why the virus was released or who released it but you and your team have discovered the location where the virus was manufactured. If the virus was created in this bunker lab, then it is possible that an antidote exists in the lab as well. At the current rate of infection the world's population will be completely infected in a matter of weeks. Your mission is to infiltrate the bunker where the virus was created and find a possible antidote. 
If you find an antidote, then you will have the power to save the world... or seal the world's fate if you decide to destroy the only antidote. Will you make the right choice?",2-10,60,Very difficult,Not scary,10+,None
