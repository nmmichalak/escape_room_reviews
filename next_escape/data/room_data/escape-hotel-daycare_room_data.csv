"Escape room ""Daycare"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-daycare,"6633 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028","Welcome to room 1919. Unfortunately, all the darling little girls we previously accommodated in this daycare have either disappeared or are dead. Since 1919, when this facility was abruptly shut down, we have been trying to reveal the truth behind their mysterious deaths and disappearances.
Unluckily, all our efforts have been unsuccessful. And now, sadly for you, you are locked up inside this very same room. If in 60 minutes, you have not been able to solve the mystery and stop the curse, your destiny will be no different than of those little girls who used to live here, or of the guests that were here before you. Enjoy your stay!",1-6,60,Average,A little scary,12+,None
