Five people are missing and haven’t been heard from…are they hiding…did they move…or is it something more sinister?
Behind the white picket fences and manicured lawns lies a very dark secret that only one person knows, but who? One thing’s for sure; you can’t trust anyone in this town, especially not your neighbor.
You and your team are sent in to investigate after the town’s lead detective goes missing. Can you pick up where he left off and help solve this mystery? Time is of the essence.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,16+,None
