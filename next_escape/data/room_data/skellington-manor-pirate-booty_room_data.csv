Skellington Manor Escape Experience is offering a unique mega-game large group option for  a fun twist to the same old group team building activity. Pirate Booty contains many of the same elements as a traditional escape room, but exceeds that experience in scale and scope. There are no locked doors to escape through here. Rather, participants work in teams of up to 8 players to open the chests on their pirate ships and solve the mystery all in one large room.  Players encounter challenging puzzles that require physical interaction, spacial reasoning, locating hidden objects, decoding secret messages, working together towards one main objective, unlock the pirate chest and recover the booty!
