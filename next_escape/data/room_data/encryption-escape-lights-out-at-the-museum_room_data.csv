The heist must be solved before the arrival of a huge crowd at the museum’s unveiling of a new painting. The security guard tells you strange occurrences have been happening, including lights dimming and galleries being plunged into darkness.
As you review the security footage, the guard explains that the stolen painting is the museum’s most popular. Suddenly a shadow moves across the footage, and the painting disappears!
