"Escape room ""The Deadly Inheritance"" by Red Herring Escape Rooms in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/red-herring-escape-rooms-the-deadly-inheritance,2,"We did the Deadly Inheritance room, and it greatly exceeded our expectations! Most of us had done an escape room before, and Red Herring was done much better. Had a great time. Love that there is a TV in the room, where they can give you tiny hints if you want / need them to get you back on track."
