"Escape room ""Western Bank Heist"" by Locks and Puzzles Escape Room in Toms River",https://worldofescapes.com/toms-river/quests/locks-and-puzzles-escape-room-western-bank-heist,0,I went through the western themed room and enjoyed it thoroughly. There was a nice mix of puzzles and everyone in our group was able to participate. When you complete the room you get to ride away with the loot on a horse which was a nice finishing touch! It's a great environment and very clean! I would highly recomme
