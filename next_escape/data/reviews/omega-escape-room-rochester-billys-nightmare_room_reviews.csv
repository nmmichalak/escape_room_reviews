"Escape room ""Billy's Nightmare"" by Omega Escape Room in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/omega-escape-room-rochester-billys-nightmare,0,"We had such a great experience from start to finish! The room we did was Billy's Nightmare. It was great, the room was super cool and challenging. We plan to try the other rooms at a later date as well as the virtual reality. The staff was exceptional! They were helpful, fun and really made sure we were happy with our experience. Our entire visit exceeded all expectations!!! "
