"Escape room ""Dark Winter's Night"" by Backstage Escape Games in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/backstage-escape-games-dark-winters-night,0,"We really enjoyed the ""Dark Winter's Night"" escape room here.  They are a bit pricier than some other rooms in town, but the game master was very attentive and helped us all have a great time.  We were traveling with our young children (1 and 10) so we need to check with escape rooms to see if they can/ will accommodate the little one.  They were great about it, let us walk right in to one of the rooms and get started.  The only downfall- there were a few things broken in the room.  IE- we had to have a metal connection at a certain point and they told my husband to use his wedding ring as the connection.  Also, when we ""escaped"" and finished all the puzzles, the room didn't react like it was supposed to.  That was disappointing.  All in all, a great experience."
