We did Ghost Busters, very challenging! Classy place with lots of seating and a great bar. And Chris F was a terrific guide."

Our first time and to be honest: for about 15 minutes, none of us had a clue as to what to do! Once we started to figure it out, then we were finally rolling. The room was done well, some of the challenges were not at all clear (most of us couldn't read one clue) our guide did a good job. We were short just one task to finish it. I would go again, it was fun and a nice/well decorated place to go."
"Escape room ""Ghostbusters!"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-ghostbusters,2,I really enjoyed myself! I went for my birthday with a group of friends and family. The atmosphere was nice! The staff was excellent! The bar was nice! We did the ghostbusters room which was super fun! They even had a card hidden in the room that said happy birthday. Awesome experience and most of all we mad it out!
"Escape room ""Ghostbusters!"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-ghostbusters,3,"This was the best escape room I've been to so far. From the decor to the bar and lastly the rooms. We did ""The Ghost buster""room and it was challenging but fun. If you choose that don't hesitate to ask for clues. Trust me you'll need them. You definitely must come with your thinking cap on. I would return whenever in DC. The staff was awesome as well such a great night!"
"Escape room ""Ghostbusters!"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-ghostbusters,4,The setting and facility are fantastic. The Ghostbuster room was challenging but doable. I don't recommend mixing parties.
