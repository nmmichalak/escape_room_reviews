"Escape room ""Simon's Room II"" by Escape Room PSL in Port St. Lucie",https://worldofescapes.com/port-st-lucie/quests/escape-room-psl-simons-room-2,0,"I brought my wife and teenage sons to complete Simon's Room and we all had a great time!  The room was very immersive and our host was amazing!  Definitely a fun time, would recommend to both puzzle enthusiasts and/or people looking to escape reality for an hour."
"Escape room ""Simon's Room II"" by Escape Room PSL in Port St. Lucie",https://worldofescapes.com/port-st-lucie/quests/escape-room-psl-simons-room-2,1,Awesome!  Tons of fun.  I did all three rooms (finished two) and had a blast.  Simon's room was my favorite... mostly because the interaction with the clue giver enhanced the experience instead of detracting from my Escape time -which is my pet peeve for this form of entertainment.
