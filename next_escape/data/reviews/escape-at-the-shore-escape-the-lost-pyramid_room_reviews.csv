Unbelievably realistic, coolest thing we've done in a very long time!! 5 stars, for sure!"
"Escape room ""Escape The Lost Pyramid VR"" by Escape at The Shore in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-at-the-shore-escape-the-lost-pyramid,1,"Our family of four did the VR Lost Pyramid at Escape at the Shore as a family gift. We aren't gamers so it took a little getting used to the controllers, but the Game Masters were very patient and helpful. The graphics are amazing! I loved that this game requires communication and that we had to work together in order to solve the puzzles. Even though we solved the game (just barely), all of us would do the game again. Our hands got sweaty, so if you have gaming gloves, bring them. This was a great family experience and a fun family activity."
