The rooms are clean  and more high tech.  The people there are helpful and so nice. We will definitely be back to try another room."
"Escape room ""The Dragon Eggs Quest"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-the-dragon-eggs-quest,1,We did two different rooms over two days. The newest room is The Dragon Eggs Quest. It was so much fun and fairly difficult which is what made it so fun! The next was the VR Space Station Tiberia. We liked them both so much! Escape Room 101 is clean and they are very customer friendly. Great area with restaurants and things to do before or after your escape room experience. Highly recommend them.

All were fun with original puzzles. As GOT fans, we really liked Dragon Eggs Quest! Recommend doing all these games!"
