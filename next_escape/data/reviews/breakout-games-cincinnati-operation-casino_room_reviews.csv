Our group did the casino-themed room and were impressed with how much thought actually went into building the room/story itself. A good amount of puzzles to solve, with some being really challenging."

"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-operation-casino,3,We had a ton of fun at Breakout. We had so much fun that we almost immediately booked another room for the following day. I think it was the highlight of the weekend for me and my friends. The puzzles were creative and the two rooms we did (mansion and casino) were different enough that it didn't feel repetitive. There were surprises in both rooms and the difficulty felt just right.

Ended up just being the two of us, and we had an absolute blast. Rebecca was a great game master and the room itself hit what I generally call the sweet spot for games: challenging but not impossible. What a rush to have finished in the nick of time!"
