It helps to have a variety of ages because some of the young (20's) guys didn't know about some of the hints. The young guys helped us older folks with crawling around. Did the agency and we'll definitely go back for the other rooms.

We were a little skeptical before going in because we had never done anything like this before but it was awesome! The game itself was fun, fast paced, challenging but still manageable for us to solve and we had a great time working together. We are from North Carolina and I'm hoping there's something like this back there, but whenever we come back in to Pittsburgh to visit family we will definitely be back here!"
