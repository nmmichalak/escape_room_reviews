Staff (Amelia, Samantha) made it really fun and we're welcoming. If you are comfortable not sleeping for a week (scary!) but want a great challenge, check out The Retreat. We escaped! :)"
"Escape room ""The Retreat"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-retreat,2,Great experience at this escape game and Samantha was great! One of the best escape games we've played and a perfect mix of puzzles and props. We played The Retreat and found the difficulty just right. Highly recommend Trapology.

We played the Retreat with a 2-player team. It was on the easy side as far as puzzles go, but still enough to keep it fun and fast-paced. The location was very nice and the staff were friendly and fun."
