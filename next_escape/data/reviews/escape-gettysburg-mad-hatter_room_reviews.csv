"Escape room ""Mad Hatter"" by Escape Gettysburg in Gettysburg",https://worldofescapes.com/gettysburg/quests/escape-gettysburg-mad-hatter,0,We had an awesome time trying to escape the Mad Hatter room. This really is fun for all ages since even my 8-year-old niece was having a blast helping us with the clues! I highly recommend Escape Gettysburg and will go again the next time I'm in the area.
"Escape room ""Mad Hatter"" by Escape Gettysburg in Gettysburg",https://worldofescapes.com/gettysburg/quests/escape-gettysburg-mad-hatter,1,I had a great time with my family escaping the Mad Hatter's Tea Party room. It was more difficult than I expected and that made it so much more fun than I anticipated too! The staff was wonderful and did a great job of taking care of our group from start to finish. Can't wait to try another room!
