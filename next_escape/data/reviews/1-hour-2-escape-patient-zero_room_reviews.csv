"Escape room ""Patient Zero"" by 1 Hour to Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/1-hour-2-escape-patient-zero,0,"This was an awesome escape room. Challenging, but not too challenging, and extremely creative. We did it with four people, but we all had a lot of experience with escape rooms. Highly recommend!!!"
"Escape room ""Patient Zero"" by 1 Hour to Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/1-hour-2-escape-patient-zero,1,I loved it. The staff was very friendly and funny. I would recommend to everyone. Best escape room I've ever done.

The theme of the game is very fun, and the ship's interactive AI is a very nice touch instead of having just a walkie-talkie game master. It fits very well with the room's story and motif. The room itself posed some really fun puzzles and challenges, as well as a good amount of different things to do. It was the first room that I've done that an 8 person room actually felt like it was sufficient in puzzles and space for 8 people. Very well done."
