"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,0,"This was an awesome escape room!  Very well done, no red herrings, and an appropriate amount of encouragement from the Game Master (Dillion).  The puzzles were great and plentiful.  The room was very professional and functioned as designed.  There were no cheesy puzzles or tricks that were stupid, as sometimes happen.  Just a Grade-A experience.  And no, we didn't solve it by the time limit, but they let us continue, and we got out about 10 minutes later.  The first escape room we didn't complete, but probably still the most fun and most challenging.  Also, the room was well-lite, so you can see without straining.  I've been in escape rooms where you can't read the combination locks because it was so dark...very frustrating...but that didn't happen here. You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.  A word of caution...don't leave anything in your vehicle while you do the escape room.  Our van was broken into and we lost some stuff.  It was our fault, we had been told earlier in the week in San Francisco not to leave anything visible in your vehicle, or they will smash and grab...and it happened to us.  Live and learn.  Good luck!"

Holy awesomeness this was one of the most amazing, fun, and catching experiences I have had!!!! The Houdini Escape Room is cleverly thought out and a fantastic puzzling challenge. If you are ever in the San Francisco area, this is a great place to go to!"

We went with a group of friends before dinner (makes a great night!). Chris (the room's creator and operator) is incredibly smart and was kind enough to spend time with us explaining how the room worked, the history of the many innovators represented in the room, etc. This is both an interesting and educational time!"
"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,3,"This escape room was incredible, by far the best I've seen. There was so much detail in every aspect of the puzzles and scenery at large. I definitely hope to solve more of these well-made rooms by Palace Games, but the Houdini Escape will surely stay up for some time. I wait with bated breath!"
"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,4,"We visited the Houdini escape room as a team building exercise for work.This was really an remarkable experience. It was fun, challenging, required team work, and definitely tested our problem solving and collaboration skills.The META analytics provided at the end of the experience were a great conversation starter about what worked and what didn't."
"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,5,"I'm a big fan of San Francisco history (and turn-of-the-century history in general). Located in the old Exploratorium building at the Palace of Fine Arts, where currently housed is the wonderful Innovation Hangar exhibition of old Panama-Pacific International Expo historic items, you'll find the Palace Games' Great Houdini Escape Room. This is the same room that Houdini presented to his notable friends 100 years prior. With a team of friends, you'll use your wits and teamworking skills to solve your way out of the room. It's challenging and very, very fun. Not sure when the Houdini room ends, but from what they've told us, we can expect a spy-themed room coming in the future.Highly recommended!"

Went with a group of 11, and we all enjoyed it thoroughly. Puzzles were fun and challenging, the entire room and atmosphere were all very nicely designed. 10/10 would recommend!"
"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,7,"The Houdini Escape Room is by far the best escape room I have done. The puzzles were all well thought out and much more creative than the standard combo-lock puzzles I've seen in the other rooms. The puzzles are challenging, but all of them made sense and there no crazy leaps that you had to make to solve it. The room itself is well put together with an underlying theme that pulls everything together and enhances the experience. The only downside of the Houdini Escape Room is that I fear that no other escape room will ever live up to this new standard.I definitely recommend the Houdini Escape Room as it is not only extremely fun and challenging, it is also the best escape room out there."
