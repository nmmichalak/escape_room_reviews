"Escape room ""Murder at the Mansion"" by Escape Dothan in Dothan",https://worldofescapes.com/dothan/quests/escape-dothan-murder-at-the-mansion,4,"My motley crew of 7 friends booked an escape from ""Murder at the Mansion"". It was what the birthday girl wanted to do on her special day and by golly (yes, that is still cool to say) we had a truly ""terrifyingly"" wonderful time. Having been the only Escape Room aficionado, I walked into the room with the understanding that...we WOULD escape. It soon came clear that we would all have to put our minds together to get through the clues, puzzles and questions to get out. And we would have done it, if it hadn't been for those meddling kids!"
