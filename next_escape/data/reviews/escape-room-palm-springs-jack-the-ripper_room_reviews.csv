For most of us it was our first time participating in any escape room. Our host, Stephanie, was very fun and helpful! She was as excited as we were, ha! We plan on visiting Palm Springs again soon and trying out the Bank Heist room! Thanks for making that part of our vacay memorable!"
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Escape Room Palm Springs in Palm Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/palm-springs/quests/escape-room-palm-springs-jack-the-ripper,1,We did the Jack the Ripper room. Not only was it really fun and challenging but Stephanie helped us from start to finish even when we told her we only had 2 people and the room required 3. The experience was everything we wanted it to be and Stephanie really helped make it that way. The room itself had the perfect mixture of challenging clues but not so challenging they made you feel like it was impossible. Definitely worth trying!
