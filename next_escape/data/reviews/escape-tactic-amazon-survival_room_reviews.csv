"Escape room ""Amazon Survival"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-amazon-survival,0,"I've been to a few hidden rooms before, but this was the most immersive, by far. The Amazon room was a brain-buster, but we were able to escape with a minute left on the clock. Would recommend!"
"Escape room ""Amazon Survival"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-amazon-survival,1,Had a lot of fun in the Amazon room! Our group finished with only 1:20 to spare! The gamemaster gave just the right amount of hints while also making us work for them
"Escape room ""Amazon Survival"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-amazon-survival,2,I don't know where to start... We did the Amazon room and it was full of surprises. I have to come back soon to try another room.. matter of fact I'll be back the week of June 4th for my birthday to conquer another tooThank you Erica for being the best Game master ever... Couldn't have done it without you!
"Escape room ""Amazon Survival"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-amazon-survival,3,"Awesome job! I absolutely love that the goal IS NOT to escape the room.It's to solve the puzzle inside of it. (Can't spill the secrets).But our work did ours in the Amazon room and it was so cool. The details are awesome, the way some things are simple and others are complicated.You really have to channel your inner 5-year-old and not overthink too much. And you honestly cannot get through it without a group effort. I'd 100% recommend it to anyone and I plan to go back for sure to try other rooms. How people come up with these is awesome and they need more!"
"Escape room ""Amazon Survival"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-amazon-survival,4,Super fun! Tyler was really nice and seemed to really love his job! The room was well put together and thought out! We did the Amazon one which is the second easiest room which was still pretty challenging. We used 5 hints and made it out with 12 minutes to spare! Will definitely go back!
