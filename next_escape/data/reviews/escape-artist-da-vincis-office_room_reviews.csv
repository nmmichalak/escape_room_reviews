"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Office"" by Escape Artist in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-artist-da-vincis-office,3,My husband and I had a great time! Since it wasn't busy we were able to take on Davinci's office by ourselves. The staff gave us help in getting through the room but overall a wonderful experience. Would recommend this place to anyone looking to spend an hour having fun while using your brain.
