"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller Room"" by Music City Escape Room in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/escape-game-tn-japanese-thriller-room,0,"The host was high energy and upbeat which made the experience a lot of fun.  The rooms themselves where of adequate quality, if a tiny bit on the low end (but just right for the price range per entry).  Almost all of the puzzles weren't so cryptic that after you used a clue you wondered how anyone would figure it out.  The best part of the room is the very small  theatrics they add to it.  I recommend it for the price. "
