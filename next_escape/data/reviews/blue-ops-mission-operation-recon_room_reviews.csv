"Escape room ""Operation: Renegade"" by Blue Ops Mission in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/blue-ops-mission-operation-recon,0,"Great experience! We have visited ~10 escape rooms throughout Texas and this was one of our favorites (Renegade room). We really love the multi-room concept. The two criticisms I would give is that I didn't love the introduction video with the storyline and feel it could have been more detailed and interesting. Also, some of the ""clues"" were VERY VAUGE.... but we escaped so I can't complain too much :). Other than that, I give this 5 stars!"

He told us what the best mission was for our 4 people group. We chose the renegade mission and it was amazing. All around 5 stars for the difficulty, props and story line. Definitely recommend it for any group of friends or family!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Renegade"" by Blue Ops Mission in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/blue-ops-mission-operation-recon,2,"We visited Blue Ops Mission with family members that have experienced several other escape rooms. This by far was our best experience yet in an escape room. It is clear that the scenario we experienced, Renegade, was well thought out. It required teamwork and a lot of thought to complete. We all had a great time. In my opinion, there was a great balance between clues and things that looked like clues.Elijah made us feel completely welcome from the start. It seemed apparent that he enjoys providing a memorable experience for his customers. He really made us feel more like visitors than customers, great attitude and communication skills. I highly recommend this location for your escape room adventures!"
