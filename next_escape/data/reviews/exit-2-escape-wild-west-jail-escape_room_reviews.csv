"Escape room ""Wild West Jail Escape"" by Exit 2 Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/exit-2-escape-wild-west-jail-escape,0,Loved it! We did the wild western jail escape and it was definitely challenging but so fun. I love how it's a family business and they come up with everything. We were a group of 5 and it was the first time for most of us. We were all raving about it when we got out and plan on doing another!

Took our family members visiting from out of state here and had a blast. Did the Jail Cell Western themed escape adventure and enjoyed the entire thing. We escaped with only 2 seconds remaining. It's great because everyone got involved, we laughed and searched and searched for clues. On the car ride home, already got requests to go again! We will be back for sure!!!"

The employees were courteous and helpful (Sarah... and I can't remember the other girl's name, but they were great!). Great escape room experience and I've been through about 12 of these now."
