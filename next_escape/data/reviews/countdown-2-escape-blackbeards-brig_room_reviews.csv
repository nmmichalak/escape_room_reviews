"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Brig"" by Countdown 2 Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/countdown-2-escape-blackbeards-brig,2,We did this as a mother's day present to our mother. We had a total of 4 people. We had such a blast doing it. The theme of our room was very creative. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was easy to locate. And very reasonable pricing. I highly recommend going here. We certainly plan on going back to try out the other rooms!
