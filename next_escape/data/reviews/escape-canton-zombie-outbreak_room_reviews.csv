We did the zombie outbreak room for our first room, and the four of us were able to get out with 2 minutes and 13 seconds to go! It was a great combination of problem solving and teamwork to escape from the room. We will definitely be coming back to do another room soon!"

It was so fun and the zombie made it way more exciting!! We had a blast. I highly recommend this place!! We escaped with about 3 minutes to spare.
