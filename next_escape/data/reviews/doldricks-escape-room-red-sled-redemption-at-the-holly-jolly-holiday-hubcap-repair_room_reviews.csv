"Escape room ""Red Sled Redemption at the Holly Jolly Holiday Hubcap Repair"" by Doldrick's Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/doldricks-escape-room-red-sled-redemption-at-the-holly-jolly-holiday-hubcap-repair,0,"Red Sled Redemption was my 44th room and the 3rd room we completed at this place. Doldrick's is by far one of the best escape room businesses in central Florida. Everything from the decor to the puzzle progression, from the lobby to our game master, it was all excellent. While we absolutely loved Red Sled Redemption, my absolutely favorite is Spoopy Bones, but honestly you can't go wrong with any of their games. This place is an excellent escape room for beginners and enthusiasts alike. ENJOY!"

Nothing was scary or inappropriate for the kids but the puzzles were still very challenging and engaging for the adults. Highly recommend!

Both amazing! The technology in the rooms was better than anywhere we've ever been. And they both hit the perfect balance of high difficulty and legit abilitiy to finish. Great stories and flow. The game masters always knew where we were, and knew exactly how to gently nudge us when needed. Well done!!!!"
