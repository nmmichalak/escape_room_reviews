"Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Seven Keys to Escape in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/seven-keys-to-escape-noras-nightmare,0,"Treated our daughter and son-in-law, grandson and granddaughter to this thrilling murder mystery scenario. Our biggest joy was watching them solve the puzzles, find the clues and open the locks. And, thank goodness we brought them along! Grampa and I most certainly would not have made it out alive!"

First of all, what an incredibly fun and out of the box idea! Also, the customer service was amazing.

I do! That's partly why I strive for all my customers to be happy as well. I have not one but TWO good customer service stories!Today is my husband's 40th birthday. He was last minute called in to work his second shift managerial job, despite having had the day marked off in the calendar since January. Not only would I not be getting to spend time with my hubs on his birthday, but I thought I'd be losing the money I spent on doing the 7 Keys to Escape experience that I had scheduled tonight at 730. I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if I could reschedule so I shot out an email. Within an hour, they replied and let me know they cancelled our appointment for tonight and they renewed the code I used to book it so that I can re book it anytime! That's so awesome."
