"Escape room ""That 70â€™s Room"" by Escape Matthews in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-matthews-that-70s-room,0,"We did the 70's Room with a small group of friends (5 of us) and had a blast! It was the first escape room for all of us, so the hints were a must. Will definitely go back to try their other rooms. The owners are great!"
