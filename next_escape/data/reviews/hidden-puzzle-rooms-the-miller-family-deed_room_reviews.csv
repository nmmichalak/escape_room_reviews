"Escape room ""The Miller Family Deed"" by Hidden Puzzle Rooms in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/hidden-puzzle-rooms-the-miller-family-deed,0,A group of friends and I ran this Miller Deed escape room and it was a blast! We had 8 people in our group and all of us had something to do - there was work to be done down to the wire. We escaped with just a few moments left on the clock with several people who had never done this type of event before. The puzzles were logical and forced us to think outside the box. I'm planning on coming back sometime in April or May!
