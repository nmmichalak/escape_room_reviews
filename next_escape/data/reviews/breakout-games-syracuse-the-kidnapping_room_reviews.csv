The kidnapped room was a bit too challenging for only 2 people, but the game master was great at managing our experience. She gave us hints when we needed them but stayed out of our way when we didn't. I would have liked more mechanical/electrical puzzles, but I imagine those are hard to do for a large chain versus a local company."
