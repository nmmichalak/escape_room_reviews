I thought I would be able to escape the Jail room quickly, since I love crime novels and tv shows. Wow, what a great challenge!Working with your partners and unraveling clues definitely makes time fly! It's great for all ages, however the crawl spaces were a bit hard to climb into. The clues weren't too frustrating and we had a great laugh afterwards!"
