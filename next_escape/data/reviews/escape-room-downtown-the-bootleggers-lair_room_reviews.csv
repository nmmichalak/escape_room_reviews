"Escape room ""The Bootlegger's Lair"" by Escape Room Downtown in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-room-downtown-the-bootleggers-lair,0,"My family did The Bootleggers Lair, and were SO impressed. It is smart, clever, tricky, challenging, but most of all, so, so fun! There were only three of us, and we were warned when booking that that would make it more challenging. It did, so that would be my one bit of advice - have a bigger group, and make sure you communicate well.Our daughter has done The Missing Detective; we'll be back someday for the Moonlight Gallery. Thanks for creating such a great space!!"

There was 7 of us in total. We all had a blast. Well crafted room by the creator. Lots of fun, challenging! We didn't quite make it through in the hour. But I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great afternoon activity! Can't wait to come back and try the other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Bootlegger's Lair"" by Escape Room Downtown in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-room-downtown-the-bootleggers-lair,2,"Excellent experience with a seemingly endless number of puzzles! We had three couples working together continuously for almost the full hour in the bootlegger's challenge. There were a ton of puzzles that needed completed to win the room, but we ended up pulling it off. We've been quite a few escape room places, but this was definitely the best one. The puzzles were challenging, but not impossible and it definitely took all of us focusing the entire time and working together to pull it off. I highly recommend and look forward to going back and running through their other rooms."
