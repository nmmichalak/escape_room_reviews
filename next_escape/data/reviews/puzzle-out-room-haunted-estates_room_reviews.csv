"Escape room ""Haunted Estates"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-haunted-estates,0,Went with 3 other friends and had a great time. The puzzles were fun to solve and weren't too hard. The staff was really friendly and encouraging. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to do an escape room.

My friends and I booked an 8pm slot for 7 earlier that day. Kind of hard to find because we didn't see any signs outside the building, but we just asked someone. Lots of puzzles to figure and going in a larger group would be best for this one so you can split up to work on the puzzles. Lots of fun! We ended up finding a couple of the clues from pure luck lol. But we escaped with 14 minutes to spare! Missed the leader board by 5 minutes :/ but so much fun nonetheless!"

They had some very clever puzzles (figuratively and literally)! With a group of 8 we had such a good time we didn't notice the time go by! Without giving out any important info, you have to think out of the box to figure many of them out. We had a great mix of friends with different strengths and everyone contributed, but we finished in the time frame, but more importantly had a great time trying to escape!!"
