This was my fourth escape room. We made it out with 20 seconds left and I was so sweaty. Lol. The pressure! Challenging, yet linear which I loved. Just enough help - the employees were very welcoming and professional. We loved the clues and tech elements. The little buttons at the end were a sweet memory. Can't wait to come back!"
