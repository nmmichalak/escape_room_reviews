"Escape room ""The Swamp"" by Escape The Puzzle in Long Branch",https://worldofescapes.com/long-branch/quests/escape-the-puzzle-the-swamp,0,"Our family had a great time at the ""Swamp"" yesterday. All 9 of us, 5 adults and 4 kids ages 10 - 15, had a lot of fun. Tina was very welcoming and gave us a great summary and introduction. The room had a wide variety of puzzles and all ages were able to participate. It was a great hour of fun and even though we didn't make it (we almost escaped) we all enjoyed the experience and we're still talking about it hours later. Highly recommended, we look forward to returning again in the future to try other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Swamp"" by Escape The Puzzle in Long Branch",https://worldofescapes.com/long-branch/quests/escape-the-puzzle-the-swamp,1,I had a group of 10 last night for the swamp room. We had so much fun. I think if we had one or two more minutes we would have gotten out. Looking forward to doing the other rooms.

The Swamp was an immersive environment and challenging enough to that our group beat it with just two seconds to spare! The staff was very helpful in bookings and accommodations. I highly recommend this experience to anyone in NJ."

We first did the Speakeasy and barely escaped! We got one more person and did the Swamp and barely made that one too with even more hints and a little bit of cheating ;) It's definitely easier with more people!Overall, the puzzles were very thoughtful, creative, and well done. The people that run it are great, very friendly, kind, and warm hearted."
