My boyfriend and I had a blast trying to solve the puzzles in the Wardenclyffe escape room. We probably would’ve finished it if we’d just had 5 more minutes! Can’t wait to go back and do another one!

Fun and very well run one . Highly recommend this place .We went as a group of 10 and this was our fist time escape room experience and not sure what to expect . The person monitoring us was super funny and helpful . He gave hints when we were stuck and we were able to go from there , completed the mission before 2 mins and felt very  proud .We chose wardenclyffe . Monday to Thursday their price is super cheap (129$) same one is 219 $ week ends .super fun and we will be going again"
