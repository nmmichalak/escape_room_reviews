"Escape room ""Riddleston's Final Investigation"" by Get Locked Away in Coeur d'Alene",https://worldofescapes.com/coeur-d-alene/quests/get-locked-away-riddlestons-final-investigation,0,"I went to Get Locked Away with three friends. We did the murder mystery room and were instantly hooked. The staff was extremely friendly and quick to get us through orientation and the introduction to our story so we could start our room as quickly as possible. The room itself was also well set up. It looked very authentic to the theme. It was not obscenely difficult, but gave us a good challenge. When we did need a hint, our game master was friendly and promptly helped us refocus to finish the room without spoon-feeding it to us. Once we finished, our game master was excited with us and celebrated our victory."

It was great. My wife and I tried, and failed to escape, from the Riddleston room. This was also the first time we had ever gone to an escape room. It was a lot of fun and very challenging. I would highly recommend it!"
