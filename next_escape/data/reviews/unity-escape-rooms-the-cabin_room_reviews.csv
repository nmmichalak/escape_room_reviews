"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Unity Escape Rooms in Redlands",https://worldofescapes.com/redlands/quests/unity-escape-rooms-the-cabin,0,"Absolutely awesome! Went for everyone's first time, in a group for my husband's b-day and had the best time. The staff is amazing and even though we didnt succeed in The Cabin we are determined to be successful in The Temple. The decorations are fantastic - we felt like we were in a cabin. Can't wait to go back!"
