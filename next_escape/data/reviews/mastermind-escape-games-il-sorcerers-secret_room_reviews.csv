"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Secret"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mastermind-escape-games-il-sorcerers-secret,0,"The entire family (including two boys ages 12 and 14) had a great time and can't wait to return!  We experienced nothing but a high-quality experience including staff, orientation, props/clues, and level of difficulty.  We successfully completed the Sorcerer mission and are looking forward to the challenge of the additional rooms!"
"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Secret"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mastermind-escape-games-il-sorcerers-secret,1,Ton of fun! We had a group of 8 friends with 2 strangers and still had a blast. 'Sorcerer's Secret' was a great room to try for beginners.

We did the Sorcerer's Secret and I definitely recommend to do this with more than 2 people! It was just me and my husband and was a bit too challenging for just the 2 of us, but would have been great with 4 - 6 more people. We still had a great time and would definitely do it again."
