"Escape room ""The List"" by Chico Escape Rooms in Chico",https://worldofescapes.com/chico/quests/chico-escape-rooms-the-list,0,"We love making memories with our family, especially during the holidays. This year we tried Chico Escape Rooms and had a fantastic time. With 1:38 left, the six of us were able to solve all of the clues and write our names on Santaâ€™s Nice List! A great way to spend a solid hour problem solving, laughing, and working together. Our family ranges in age from 18 to 65 and we ALL had a great time. Highly recommend."
