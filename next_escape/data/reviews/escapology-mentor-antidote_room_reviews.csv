"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Mentor in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escapology-mentor-antidote,0,We went to Escapology to celebrate my husband's birthday with 2 of our friends. We did the Antidote room and had a great time! The staff were friendly and organized. Definitely recommend! Will go back for other themes.
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Mentor in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escapology-mentor-antidote,1,"Our team from work decided to escape from the ""Antidote Room"" as our team building event.We signed our waivers, were briefed, and led to our room. The basics were explained, and the door was closed. Our group was 7 people, and the first room of the challenge is pretty tight. We needed a couple hints, but we got the 2nd door open. The clues in the room and the puzzles were a lot of fun. We all had a great time during the event. There were skills needed from each of us; very inclusive.We enjoyed good natured bickering, sleuthing, and lots of laughter. We did manage to get out of the room in under an hour. We want to return for other rooms because we really enjoyed our time. Nothing was too challenging (that would cause frustration), and it was tons of fun solving the puzzles."
