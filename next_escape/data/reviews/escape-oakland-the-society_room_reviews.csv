"Escape room ""The Society"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-the-society,0,"WOW. I have to say this placed has really stepped it up with their new room! If you haven't I highly recommend the Society room especially if you are new to escape rooms. As someone who has done over 50, this room is very solid.It's a nice room with several varieties of puzzles throughout.  None felt too hard or poorly designed. I played the room with 2 others and it felt very comfortable and nothing felt impossible. Everything went at a smooth pace. We were all experienced, so we all took our time and didn't feel the urge to rush. With that said we still had a out 5 minutes remaining.There were some locks here and there, but it also had its fair share of electronic puzzles as well. (Thankfully nothing glitched). I highly recommend this room if you are a beginner to escape rooms because it contains the basics that most rooms give to you throughout the country.  And if you are an expert still play it because you can't go wrong.The lobby is nice and the staff is nice as well, but overall if you have played a game here before.... YOU NEED TO COME BACK and play Society because this hands down is the best room here. That's a fact. Not an opinion."
