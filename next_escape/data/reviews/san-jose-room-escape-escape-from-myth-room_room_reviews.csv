Fewer people, more intimate, more chances to do more puzzles. We didn't get out in time, but instead of just telling us the answers, he asked if we wanted a few more minutes because we were so close. He gave us the extra minute or two that we needed to figure it all out. Awesome, and we're looking forward to doing another one with you."
