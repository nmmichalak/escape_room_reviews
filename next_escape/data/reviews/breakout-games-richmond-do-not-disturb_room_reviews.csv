The effects were great! We were so close to breaking out, but got hung up on the last clue. Jake was great at giving clues that didn't just give the answer. I'll def want to come back and try other rooms!"

I couldn't have picked a better thing to do for a monumental milestone birthday or a better place to try it for the first time. Our game master, Kayla, was great and made our birthday celebration extra fun. (And totally didn't judge us geeking on how much fun we were having!!) We didn't know what to expect never having done one before. It was a perfect level of tough. Enough to be engaging but not enough to make you feel like it's impossible. When we want something out-of-the -ordinary to do, we'll be trying another one of the rooms!!!! Thanks for a great time and fun memories!"
