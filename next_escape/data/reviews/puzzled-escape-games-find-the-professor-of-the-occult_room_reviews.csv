"Escape room ""Find the Professor of the Occult"" by Puzzled Escape Games in Easthampton",https://worldofescapes.com/easthampton/quests/puzzled-escape-games-find-the-professor-of-the-occult,0,"2nd room I played with this company. It was pretty standard and straightforward in theme and set but the story was great, puzzles were presented in a unique way, secrets and seeds were planted all over the room and everything came together in the end. Very challenging, great for a group of 8, I can't imagine a group of less than four solving this in under an hour. Like their other adventures the room is spacious with plenty of puzzles to solve. I think the solve rate is around 25 percent. Good beginner room, challenging but there are a few short cuts more seasoned players could take."

We did the Professor one, and it was a challenge for a group of 8 smart, well-read adults. I'll have to go back for Escobar soon!"

This was our 31 escape room... the puzzles were challenging and entertaining! Our game master Emery was exactly what we look for when we go to escape rooms! She was energetic, friendly, and welcoming! Give this escape room a try!"

I was impressed by how difficult and intricate every detail was. You really thought you were in the professor's study and just when you thought you got it, something else happened! Sadly we needed about 5 more mins! The game master for our group was great, she gave us a few free clues :)"
