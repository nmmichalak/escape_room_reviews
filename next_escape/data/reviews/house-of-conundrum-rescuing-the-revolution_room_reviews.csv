"Escape room ""Rescuing The Revolution"" by House of Conundrum in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/house-of-conundrum-rescuing-the-revolution,0,"Went here a couple months back and did the Revolution room. Didn't quite know what to expect since it was my first room. When they stuck us in a small room and told us we had an hour, I was skeptical that it was going to go by fast. I thought I might be bored out of my mind or claustrophobic at the very least- it was neither of those things!The clues were well set up and the experience was very engaging. For the four of us (who were all first-timers), we enjoyed it very much and are planning a second visit this upcoming Saturday.If you've never been to an escape room, I highly recommend House of Conundrum."
