By far one of the best ways to have a good time in the area. The staff was so sweet and the place is really clean. We did the kidnapping with 2 adults and 2 kids (a teen and tween). They had a blast and I can't wait to go back for the other rooms. This would be a great place to take a group for a birthday celebration too!
