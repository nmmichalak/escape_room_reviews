"Escape room ""Benedict's Study"" by Paradox Point in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/paradox-point-benedicts-study,0,We had a great time at the Benedict Arnold room at Paradox Point. It was our first experience at an escape room. So much fun. Highly recommend checking it out. We escaped with 5 minutes to spare. Loved it!

We had fun, staff was nice, cute decor and clean. Price was reasonable in my opinion as we checked at a few other spots and for our party of six, $20/person was great in comparison to 28/person at other locations for a party of the same size."
