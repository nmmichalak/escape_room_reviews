"Escape room ""Horror Nursery Rhyme"" by Exitology Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/exitology-escape-room-horror-nursery-rhyme,1,I played the Horror Nursery Rhymes with my husband and 4 friends last week. The props were awesome and the story is thrilling! We had a lot of fun. The staffs were very nice and helpful. Will definitely recommend it to my friends!

There was six of us and we absolutely loved this game. We picked the Horror Nursing Rhyme, but believe me, it's not horrible at all, and it's more like a detective story and the whole team has to cooperate very well to win. All the puzzles are set intriguingly. The story ending is unexpected but making perfect sense. Will go with friends again."
