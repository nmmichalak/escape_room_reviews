"Escape room ""Gangster’s Gamble"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-gangsters-gamble,0,Celebrated my birthday here by doing the Gangster’s Gamble room and it was probably the most fun I’ve had for a birthday event. The game master was awesome and the room was such a good beginners experience for escape rooms. Will definitely be back soon!
"Escape room ""Gangster’s Gamble"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-gangsters-gamble,1,"We had a date night here, we picked the Gangster's Gamble room set in the 1950's with all kinds of puzzles to solve to bust the crime boss. A lot of thought was put on making everything look time authentic. It was definitely a bigger challenge for just 2 people, but highly recommended for fun night out. Our guild Waldo was amazing and we got some extra clues to move forward. So get ready to put your phones away and go play!"

It's a great, fun  place with warm, welcoming and very helpfull staff. It's a MUST BE in Chicago. I heard they are opening another room so me and my friends will be back there for sure. "

Great welcoming staff introduced us to the rules and let us start right away. We have not been prepared for that much fun in such a short time. We played Gangster's game and loved it so much we decided to take next open slot and check the witch game. This came out to be even more fun for all of us. Great fun for all family, including my teenagers who were a bit skeptic about trying it out. Can't wait to come back!"
"Escape room ""Gangster’s Gamble"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-gangsters-gamble,4,"Some friends and I recently took a trip up to Chicago as a mini-excursion. We have done a few room escape rooms in the past and this one was bar none the best we have done so far! We did Gangster's Gamble and the room was absolutely immersive. All of the props were completely appropriate to the theme. You literally felt like you were shoved into a time machine and teleported into a completely different world. You can really tell they took the time to meticulously think out every element. Also they offered a completely private experience at a fraction of the price of other room escapes in the area, which is something we really enjoyed and appreciated."
