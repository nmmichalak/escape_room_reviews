"Escape room ""Apocalypse"" by Mission: Breakout Lafayette in Lafayette (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/lafayette-in/quests/mission-breakout-lafayette-apocalypse,0,"I don’t understand the positive reviews on this room. I’ve done almost ten rooms in the last few years, and this was the most disappointing. The clues were not remotely clever. It was more like paying to stand in a room and solve riddles, and not terribly well-planned riddles either. Do a different room. A lot out there are way better than this one. "

"Escape room ""Apocalypse"" by Mission: Breakout Lafayette in Lafayette (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/lafayette-in/quests/mission-breakout-lafayette-apocalypse,3,Came in with a group of 10 members and had a great time. Scheduling the event was easy. You can do it online or over the phone. I did it over the phone and the owner Eric was very happy to help. They have 3 choices for the escape room. We went for the Apocalypse room and I would definitely recommend it. The lI would definitely go back for one of the other rooms.
