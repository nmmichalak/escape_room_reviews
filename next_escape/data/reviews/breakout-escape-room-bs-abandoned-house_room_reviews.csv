"Escape room ""Abandoned House"" by Brainstorm Escape Room Bonita Springs in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/breakout-escape-room-bs-abandoned-house,0,My first time doing an escape room last night and Brainstorm did not disappoint. Our guide was very helpful and friendly. I really enjoyed myself and will be back .. we did the abandoned house which was a hard level but really fun.. we didn't make it out but for our first time did pretty well.. I'd like to go back and finish that room and do another the same night. We will be back!
