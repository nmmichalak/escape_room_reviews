"Escape room ""The Omega Code"" by The Code and Key Escape Rooms in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/the-code-and-key-escape-rooms-the-omega-code,0,"I really enjoyed this escape room due to the fact that it is private bookings only. It makes for a more intimate and fun experience with those in your group. It was challenging and lots of fun. I would recommend for all ages. The people working were very nice, friendly, and helpful! I would definitely go back."

It was challenging and entertaining. We will be back when the other room is ready!"
