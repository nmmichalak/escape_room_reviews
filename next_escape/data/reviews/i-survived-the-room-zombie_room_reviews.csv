"Escape room ""Zombie Experience"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-zombie,4,"Close friends and family took me here as a birthday surprise since I absolutely love being scared and everything horror! Upon entry I was greeted by a nice crowd of thrill seekers purchasing tickets for a range of activities. While waiting for our host to lead us to ""The Room"" I went to use the restroom in the back. Low and behold (I had no idea) I was literally chased into the restroom by a very real looking zombie. Screaming and yelling for dear life I locked myself into the bathroom. I won't share the rest because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. All I will say is GO GO GO!Not to spoil the surprises in the room I will only tell you to prepare for an intense thrill that will require much more than bravery. You will need to put your thinking cap on to solve the ruse, disguised as ""rules"" to help you and your group get out and survive the god awful room. My only complaint is I wanted more, I wish it was longer and I hoped for a deeper maze or Sanatorium to explore. Either way, this gets 4 stars for creativity, make-up, and suspense. I loved it and will be going again. I just have to find a way to survive this room!! "
