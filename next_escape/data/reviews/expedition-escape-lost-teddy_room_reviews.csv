"Escape room ""Lost Teddy"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-lost-teddy,0,We did the Da Vinci room with friends weeks ago and had such an awesome time. Our kids got really jealous so we had to book the Lost Teddy room for them today. The whole car ride home was them figuring out what room they were going to do next!
