"Escape room ""Depths Of Osiris VR"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-depth-of-osiris,0,"Amazing experience!! First we started with the hangover. Hard but not too hard. It is for 7 people so if you do not have 7 they will fill in the spaces. Something the website didn’t explain clearly. However, we had a great couple that played the game with us and we had a wonderful time. Then we switched to the VR side. I do have to mention it is not in the same building. So do not book these too close together. We did the ocean Osiris. It was fantastic!!!! The staff helps you so you dont feel lost. We ended our night with the hospital horror. This is not an escape room, it was an “experience”. I was so submerged in my experience that I,... kind of forgot it wasn’t real. I screamed and took off my headset. My greatest fear was in that room and it felt too real to deal with it lol when I tapped out the staff was right by my side with smiles. They made me feel comfortable and supported. I came we’re with my husband and 2 older teens. We ABSOLUTELY recommend his location to EVERYONE."
