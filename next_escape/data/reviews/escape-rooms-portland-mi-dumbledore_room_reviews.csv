"Escape room ""Dumbledore: The Quest"" by Escape Rooms Portland Michigan in Lansing",https://worldofescapes.com/lansing/quests/escape-rooms-portland-mi-dumbledore,0,"A remarkable memory with my family. The details, puzzles, and thought put into the Dumbledore Office was phenomenal. I was of little help but watching my kids and sisters family working hard at all of the puzzles and decoding the clues was definitely a cherished memory. We have a smart bunch, that is for sure. Bravo Escape Room, a excellent Mothers Day spent."
"Escape room ""Dumbledore: The Quest"" by Escape Rooms Portland Michigan in Lansing",https://worldofescapes.com/lansing/quests/escape-rooms-portland-mi-dumbledore,1,"We escaped Dumbledore's office and had a great time. Our group was mixed with Harry Potter fans and some with no knowledge of the series, and with some who had done escape rooms and some who hadn't - all of us enjoyed the room and the challenge. Thanks for having us!"

Was a lot of fun. We came close to finishing(2nd to last puzzle). I would recommend doing this with at least 5-6 people if you can, will definitely increase your odds. Staff was great. I would definitely like to come back and try the other two rooms they have!"

They are all Harry Potter fans and were very excited to visit your lovely establishment. The puzzles were creative, well themed, and provided the perfect amount of challenge. Everyone appreciated the perfectly timed clues that were provided along the way. The ongoing support allowed the group to stay engaged. Even though the group did not complete the challenge, it was kind of you to walk them through the ending after the timer had expired. Five stars!"
