This is by far the best and most professional one we've seen. Great stories, puzzles, and props!  The staff is awesome as well!  We liked it so much we did a second right after (Enigmista and Machina)."
"Escape room ""Machina"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-machina,1,Amazing experience. Lots of fun. Gets your brain honking; collaboration and community skills going. Highly recommend with friends or even alone and make friends there.
"Escape room ""Machina"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-machina,2,Very fun! Took my niece for her birthday and we did the artificial intelligence room. We didnâ€™t escape but we had a blast! Definitely going to come again.

It is ranked a medium level and rightfully so. We had an hour to solve the puzzle and escape. The clues were well hidden but solvable. It was our first escape room and we made it out with only minutes to spare! The facility was large, clean, and easy to find. The staff was fantastic. We worked with Casey, Cheyenne, and Taylour, all of whom had the ability to answer our questions and play back as we got into the spirit of AI taking over. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to checking out a few of their other rooms!"

A fun room (machina), great themes, and awesome staff! Casey, Cheyenne, and Taylour were super fun! Can't wait to go back and do another one!"
