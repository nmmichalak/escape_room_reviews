"Escape room ""Room 1301"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-room-1301,2,"We had been here once before to solve the Murder at Mystery Manor and had such a great time, we just had to come back and try their newest room, Room 1301. It didn't disappoint. Awesome effects and new, challenging puzzles. Plus the staff there are awesome at making sure everyone has a great experience. We're all talking about going back and trying to solve the Dark Wizard room. If you haven't tried Escape from Mystery Manor yet, go ahead and sign up. You won't be disappointed."
