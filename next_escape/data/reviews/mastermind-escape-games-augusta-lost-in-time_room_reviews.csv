"Escape room ""Lost in Time"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Augusta",https://worldofescapes.com/augusta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-augusta-lost-in-time,0,First escape room I ever did. We had a group of 4. we were with 2 adults and 2 kids. We had a great time. We almost made it it out. The staff was awesome and helpful. If you decide to run lost in time don't over think things. It will cost you valuable time.

I don't think we did particularly well, but the loudspeaker helpers were great.You want something fun to do, this is definitely a great option! All the employees we met were very nice, super helpful, and willing to explain everything. We'll be back, it might just take us a little bit because the price is a bit steep."

We're already planning our next group visit. Our host Ariel did fabulous job explaining everything. The Lost in Time room was a good challenge. Agent 7 presented the room in a fun way and was very helpful. We escaped!
