It's a little pricey but worth all the fun you get out of it. We went as a group of 7 which I probably assume is better than getting grouped with other individuals. The escape room really makes you think and work as a team."

The whole point of these things is to have fun challenging your brain with different puzzles and this one absolutely delivered. Full immersion seems to be the focus of 60 to Escape, it's not just about basic problem solving but really incorporating the theme in fun and different ways. Canâ€™t wait to try the next room as soon as I can get my group together again. Absolutely would recommend for anyone looking for something fun and different."
