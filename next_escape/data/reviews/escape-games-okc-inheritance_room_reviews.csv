We did the hardest room, Inheritance. Although the room was challenging, my group still had a lot of fun. We are planning on returning to do another room soon.This is my third escape room to do in OKC. Overall, excellent customer service and the room is well done. Would definitely recommend trying Escape Games OKC to others."
