"Escape room ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Escape Room Kansas City in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/escape-room-kansas-city-the-da-vinci-code,1,We enjoyed the Da Vinci room yesterday! There were four of us and we escaped in just over 30 minutes. We were always ahead of the clues and didnâ€™t use either of the 2 hints. So I think the difficulty might be a bit overstated.

My husband and I found it both fun and competitive. We escaped the Da Vinci room with 3 seconds to spare. The adrenaline and the puzzles were worth every minute and dollar. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.
