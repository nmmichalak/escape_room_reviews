"Escape room ""Trouble in Paradise"" by Escape Countdown in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/escape-countdown-sarasota-trouble-in-paradise,0,We (3 of us) visited this escape room when we were in Sarasota and decided to do the Jailbreak room. We really enjoyed it - the clues were quite tricky so we had to ask for help a couple of times but we escaped! We enjoyed it so much that the next day we decided to do the Trouble In Paradise room - also really enjoyed this room and escaped. The hosts were great and friendly. Highly recommended.

We had so much fun, we did another immediately. The rooms are themed super fun, lots of interactive stuff, and complex enough to be challenging without being impossible. The staff was also super friendly and upbeat.We did the beach and prison room - while both were fun, we felt like the beach room had more and varied stuff going on for everyone to be actively engaged the whole time, less stuck/thinking time."

This would be a great team building activity for small groups. We ""escaped"" in less than an hour, and the whole group was engaged in the process. Fun for families, work groups, team building, etc. Highly recommend"
