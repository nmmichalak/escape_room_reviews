These rooms are fully immersive. Even down to the way they administer the clues! Trap Door takes escape rooms to the next level with intensity, creativity, and passion. The employees are great and do a fantastic job at setting the scene and getting you to push yourself. (Plus occasionally scaring you out of your socks. I’m looking at you Witch Hunt game master)."
