"Escape room ""Mirror Mirror"" by Brainstorm Escape Room Bonita Springs in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/breakout-escape-room-bs-mirror-mirror,0,"This was my first Escape Room experience. I had a really great time in the Mirror, Mirror room. It was perfect for 4 to 6 people.I really loved that the actual upstairs lobby was themed and part of the story before entering the room. The music added to the suspense and the clue communication tech was really great. I would definitely go back and recommend this to anyone interested in trying. From what others told me Dinner Party is their star attraction.The con that took away from the experience was that that Breakout remove price tags and refresh some of the props. Also, some of the puzzles would have been impossible without someone who had been to an Escape Room before."

Went with a group of girls from work, did the Mirror Mirror room. Failed miserably but not for lack of trying on the game-master's part! Very helpful with the clues, we were so close at the end but time just ran out. We will definitely be back to try our luck again!"
