"Escape room ""The Office Of Dr. Landau"" by Epic Escape Game in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/epic-escape-game-the-office-of-dr-landau,0,"We had a great time trying to escape The Office of Dr Landau. There were seven of us, ages 13 to 60, and we all worked together reading and solving clues. Even though we did not escape within the 60 minutes, we were extremely close to making the escape. Jacob did an amazing job directing us through the experience, from the time we walked in until we walked out. We will visit Epic Escape Muncie again. The location and ease of parking added to this excellent rating."
