"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-shanghaied,0,"Staff was friendly, rooms were interesting, puzzles were challenging. The best part, the room we were in (Shanghaied) held up to 8 ppl. Although we were a party of 4, they didn't make us pair up w/ other parties. They keep their rooms private. I wish every place was like that. It's very difficult working w/ strangers. We had a great time and are looking forward to trying another room!"
"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-shanghaied,1,We chose the Shanghaied room and it was awesome. Our first time in an escape room and we’ll be back! Our youngest was only 9 so it was a bit beyond her but the 12 yr old and 14 yr old did great! It was quite a challenge as it was the first time and we did receive a bit of help from Jimmy....just enough to get us through and he made it a great experience for all of us! The only negative we could come up with is that there isn’t a single sign on any door of the building indicating where Escapology was located in the building. A sign would alleviate any confusion! Thanks again for a really fun and unusual day!
"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-shanghaied,2,Awesome experience for the whole family! We first did the Murder Mansion and after having such a great time we immediately booked Shanghaied and did that room the same night! Already planning the next trip to go back to do the other two rooms. Kids even had a great time and were able to help with puzzles. Game Master was awesome and helped with clues as we needed. As first timers we were able to escape both rooms!
