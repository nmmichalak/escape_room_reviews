"Escape room ""Hostage Crisis"" by 5th Street Escape Room in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/5th-Street-Room-Escape-The-Hostage-Room,1,This was our 2nd experience with escape rooms. Our group did the Hostage Crisis and Declaration of Independence. The rooms were thoughtfully crafted and well put together. Challenging games but lots of fun. I would recommend 5th Street to anyone looking.

You have 60 minutes to solve the puzzles and find the 4 digit combination for the bank vault. We had so much fun there. Can't wait to go back. They are open every Friday, Saturday and Sunday."
