"Escape room ""The Dark Wizard’s Curse"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-the-dark-wizards-curse,1,"This is a new venue for Meridian, Idaho and it's a keeper. A group of 6 women who felt we were pretty smart and capable solved several problems but failed at the given task of escaping. This was a first attempt by 5 of us, the 6th had done one in another state. We had an absolute ball learning we know less than we dreamed. It's a great escape for a group to play, interact and try to figure things out. Make this one of your events when you are in the area. It's time well spent."
"Escape room ""The Dark Wizard’s Curse"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-the-dark-wizards-curse,2,"I played The Dark Wizard's Curse with a group of 5. Four of us were veterans, having played over 100 different rooms. The hosts were very nice, seemed to really appreciate escape rooms, and were pleasant to talk with. Owners are newer to the business, maybe haven't been to many top rooms, and that seems to have shown through slightly in the game design and puzzles. That doesn't take a lot away from my rating, since that is typical of a smaller market independent locations. We enjoyed ourselves throughout, we came into this expecting a certain experience and that was delivered. We will definitely be back for the other room, but that is mostly because it is the only room in the whole Treasure Valley we haven't yet tried.The rest of this review is mostly for other veterans, since 95% of reviews tend to not be truly helpful when needing to choose between multiple escape room options:The set clearly took a lot of work, and gives a grand first impression, but I question if that effort was placed in the right areas. I'd have liked for the themed decor to be more purposeful and integrated into the puzzles more than it was, the result was just more red herrings. Puzzles were not as intuitive or satisfying as I would hope (more than once did we say a variation of the following: ""I guess try this answer...oh, that worked!?""); and the ending was slightly anti-climactic. I'd put The Dark Wizard's Curse at about the 40th percentile for the rooms in Treasure Valley."
