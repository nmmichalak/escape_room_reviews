"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Bunker"" by The Bunker Experience in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-bunker-experience-the-buker-experience,0,"This was probably the best escape room experience I've had. I've been to 5 different companies and this was by far the most engaging! It's not your typical room with some decorations and puzzles, it truly feels like you're in an underground bunker trying to escape what's coming after you.We had 4 people and completed the Chapter 1 experience. The puzzles were creative and challenging. The atmosphere, story, live actors, and overall experience was incredible. We could feel the pressure of trying to escape and the fear of losing. This made the puzzles more difficult and definitely had our hearts racing. We're definitely going back to complete Chapter 2!"

It was OUTSTANDING. The actors and all the staff were amazing, the set design and production value top notch, the story was great, and was just scary enough to be so. Much. FUN. We completed Chapter One with about 10 minutes to spare, and we will DEFINITELY be coming back for Chapter 2."
