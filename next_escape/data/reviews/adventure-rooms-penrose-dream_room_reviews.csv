I've been there twice and had so much fun both times! I love that you are able to have a private room. My husband and I did it the first time and we brought our daughter the second time. All of us absolutely LOVED it! We can't wait to go back!"
"Escape room ""The Hidden Cabin"" by Adventure Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/adventure-rooms-penrose-dream,2,My family and I had a great time. We made no reservations yet they had one open room and where able to take us right in. We will be back for another try.
"Escape room ""The Hidden Cabin"" by Adventure Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/adventure-rooms-penrose-dream,3,I've been here 3 times. Great place especially if you're a beginner. The puzzles aren't too crazy. You definitely have to think outside of the box though. It would be a lot of fun for all ages. I love how the bookings are private. That's not something most escape rooms allow. I'll definitely return when they change their themes.
