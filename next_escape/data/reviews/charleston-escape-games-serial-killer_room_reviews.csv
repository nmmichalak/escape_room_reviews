"Escape room ""Serial Killer"" by BreakOut Escape Game in Charleston",https://worldofescapes.com/charleston/quests/charleston-escape-games-serial-killer,0,Went for my daughter's 11th birthday. So much fun! We failed to escape the serial killer but enjoyed every minute of the game! Will definitely plan on visiting again... maybe with more than just four fifth graders as teammates!

I was very impressed at how well this was put together. Plus the owner and staff were extremely friendly and fun which made it that much better. Can't wait to go back. Would highly recommend checking it out. You won't be disappointed.

We did the Serial Killer room, and while the two of us didn't make it out alive, we were allowed time to finish the puzzle (luckily there were no appointments after us). It was challenging & loads of fun. We will be going back with a slightly larger group & this time, we will definitely break out! The owned was kind, helpful & we will see him again soon!"
