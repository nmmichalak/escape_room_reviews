"Escape room ""Private Detective Agency: Knight & Rook Investigations"" by Puzzle Effect Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/denver-escape-room-private-detective-agency,0,We've done numerous escape rooms in numerous locations & Denver Escape Room continues to be our favorite. We've done all of their rooms that are available right now & each one of them has been fantastic. Their puzzles are unique & perfectly challenging. Their sets are all thorough & realistic so you actually feel like you are wherever the theme says you are. If you need a hint they don't just give away the answer - they still allow you to solve the puzzles on your own. Every staff interaction we've had has been enjoyable too. Definitely 11/10 recommend!

The room we did (knight &rook) had great puzzles, the theme of the room was great and our game master was awesome. We will be coming back to do more!"
"Escape room ""Private Detective Agency: Knight & Rook Investigations"" by Puzzle Effect Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/denver-escape-room-private-detective-agency,2,Super fun and the time flies. We took the whole family here and had to work as a team to solve the mystery! It was for my 17 year old's birthday. We did the Knight & Rook room. Everyone was involved and it was a bunch of fun. Our ages ranged from 10 to adults. It was a challenge and we really enjoyed it! Great time and we will be back!
