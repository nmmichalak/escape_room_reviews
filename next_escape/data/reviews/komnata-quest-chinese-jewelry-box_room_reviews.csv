"Escape room ""Hex of the Chinese Jewelry Box"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-chinese-jewelry-box,2,"Last week I tried Chinese Jewelry Box with a friend, which was recommended for beginners, and we had a blast. I didn't have a lot of experience with live escape games and wanted to try something easier. We finished this quest in a little bit under an hour, and we enjoyed it immensely. The way the rooms were decorated and the music playing in the background created the appropriate atmosphere and engaged all of our senses (besides smell), and we felt like we were indeed inside a video game. Almost every object we discovered in the rooms was meaningful, and the clues were relatively easy to find and use, although we did have to think about them. Overall, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Although it is probably possible to go on this quest by yourself, I would definitely recommend bringing friends. They will often pick up on the clues you miss, and it's a lot more fun to have a buddy on a quest. Chinese Jewelry Box would also be great for children, as most of the clues require object searching rather than puzzle solving. Hence, if you're going on a quest for the first time, this could be a good start, though beware: you can get hooked. I'm already thinking about the other quests I'd like to try."

Was definitely challenging to try and piece the clues together and get out of the room in 60 minutes. Great afternoon for me and my 2 friends. We made it out in 54 minutes. Will come again!

This the best escape room I've been to so far! If you are active, smart and like a challenge this game is for you! The atmosphere of the room, story and props - all make it really great. Looking forward to new rooms opening, can't wait try to escape again! Will recommend it to my friends! "
