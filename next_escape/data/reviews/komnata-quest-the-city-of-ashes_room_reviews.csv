My boyfriend and I came here today for my birthday, and it was just the two of us working together to solve the mysteries. It was really cool and interesting actually, and incredibly immersive. I can't wait to go to the Greenpoint location to do more of their games!"
"Escape room ""The City of Ashes"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-the-city-of-ashes,1,I've done the Maze of Hakaina and really enjoyed it. I also did the City of Ashes in the Williamsburg site and I really like the creativity of these rooms. One of the best ones yet!

Use the walkies if you need help, just don't change the station! Will be going back for the Game of Thrones themed room."

They also named this as their ""scariest"" room, which I would now say is not the case - 1408 may have scared me a bit more.  Regardless, we loved this room too.  Such a bone-chilling environment, great use of space, and very calculated timing for some of their more ""lively"" props.  Both rooms exceeded expectations of everyone in my group."
