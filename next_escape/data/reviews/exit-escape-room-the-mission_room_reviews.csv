"Escape room ""The Mission"" by Exit Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/exit-escape-room-the-mission,0,Went with a group of 8. Friendly staff. The clues are pretty straightforward. My friends and I got out in 30-40 minutes. We did the spy mission one. they're actually preparing a submarine one in the future. They have the staff try it out which I thought was thoughtful and a good quality check.

We had a ball, although a bit challenging and we needed the assistance of our Commander via the intercom, still, it was so much fun.They folks running it was so nice and fun to speak to after we escaped.I recommend this for a group of friends looking to have a unique and fun NYC experience!"

The staff was super nice (and helpful when we needed hints), and the game kept us guessing for the entire hour. We'll definitely be back to do the other room soon!"

We escaped the Subway room before, and both rooms were awesome. My group has done over 50 rooms and I would say both these rooms are very professional. I felt The Mission was slightly more challenging. Both rooms are high tech and really make you think. The puzzles are well planned out and the interior of both rooms looked great. The Owner Mike is also a very nice guy and very professional. Can't wait to come back in here a couple months when they open the 3rd room."

I played and really enjoyed both of their rooms. If you're looking for the hardest games you won't find them here, but there is plenty to love for both beginners and experienced escapers. Perfect for small groups or even couples, both games have great sets and are full of unique and creative interactions. Most importantly, they were SUPER FUN, so just go try it out!"
