"Escape room ""Asylum"" by America's Escape Game in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/americas-escape-game-sm-asylum,0,"Best time... ever!!! Honestly, the entire staff at America's Escape Game were fun, energetic and welcoming! Siggy was our ""guide"" and she was phenomenal! Our group (7 people = 3 adults, 4 teenagers) had such an amazing experience in the Asylum room. The clues were challenging but not impossible. We finished in 42 minutes and are currently 5th on the leader board . We have finally found a new activity our families thoroughly enjoy! Can't wait to go back!"

We had 15 participants and completed Asylum in two groups. This is a great evening out, where employees enjoy each others company, develop healthy communication skills and work together to solve riddles! A little competition never hurt anyone either.We can't wait to come back. Siggy was fun and helpful too!"

The staff was amazing, the puzzles were a blast and the room (The Asylum) was so much fun! Can't wait to return and try out the other rooms! Thanks for a great time!"

I almost took away a star for their dependence on combination locks, but those are merely the end of what's usually a satisfying variability in getting said digits/letters/directions."

The room was challenging and we did pretty well considering it was just the two of us. It was set up well and the ambience was fantastic. The employees were very helpful and friendly. It was an excellent experience. We would definitely return, although with a bigger group next time!"
