This is the 2nd time I have been to an escape game of some type and this one was just as exciting as the first. We will definitely be back!!"
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/Breakout-Louisville-The-Kidnapping,3,Our group tried and succeeded the kidnapping challenge tonight! We'll definitely be back to play the other challenges as well! It required a lot of teamwork to accomplish it with time to spare. Our game master Addison(spelling?) was awesome! He made it a great experience for us! Thank you Breakout Louisville!
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/Breakout-Louisville-The-Kidnapping,4,"Awesome! Have never done anything like this before and really didn't know what to expect. I can safely say I was pleasantly satisfied. We did the kidnapping scenario and didn't think we would make it but our team pulled through in the last 10 minutes. My only complaint would be that during the escape we had two ""tools"" that did not work and had to be replaced. During the time of those tools being replaced our time didn't pause. Just take a little bit of time before each game to make sure that all of the equipment works. Other than that we had a great time and will most definitely be coming back to try the other scenarios. "
