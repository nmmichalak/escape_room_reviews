"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-the-room-milwaukee-the-dig,0,"We had a very exciting time escaping from this room with less than one minute left. Thankfully we were teamed up with three smart, young, and enthusiastic people. Great fun working on the clues. We did ask for help a few times, and all six of us contributed. This was our second visit to an escape room. First time that we escaped. I highly recommend The Dig."

My co-workers and I went as a team building exercise. We did The Dig room, and it was very fun! We made it out in about 46 minutes. Definitely want to go back and try the other rooms!"
