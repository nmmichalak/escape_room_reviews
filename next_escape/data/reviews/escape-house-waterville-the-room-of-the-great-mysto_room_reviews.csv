"Escape room ""The Room of the Great Mysto"" by Escape House Waterville in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/escape-house-waterville-the-room-of-the-great-mysto,0,"My brother, 9-year-old niece and I went last Sunday to the Mysto Room. It was so much fun. We expected it to be a little over my niece's head, but she really enjoyed it and helped. That being said, we barely escaped... so it wasn't too easy either."

We went into Great Mysto, and while we got stuck and tried to power through, our Game Master gave us hints to move in the right direction. We escaped with a little over 2 minutes left, but it was enjoyable the entire way. We will be hitting the hurricane room....as soon as we get a bit more practice under our belt."

We did the Mysto room and had an awesome time (mostly because we ended up escaping). Also, Cassidy did an amazing job and even stayed after to talk with us and answer all of our questions for an extra hour. She was so nice and made the experience even better than it already was. Would definitely recommend this escape house!"
