"Escape room ""Speakeasy Nouveau"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-speakeasy-nouveau,0,"We played the Speakeasy Nouveau as a family. It was my husband and I and our two 10 year old boys.We have played a couple of escape rooms in the past as a family, so we have a little experience. This rooms is by far our very favorite ever. The story, variety of clues and puzzles, and props were all very well done. We also love the fact that its more than one room, you are led into more rooms with more clues which adds so much to the excitement! We found the clues sufficiently challenging, as we had to ask for a couple of hints along the way. The number of puzzles was perfect as we escaped with literally no time to spare. We had such a great time we came back the next night, while we were still in town, and brought another family along with us. The eight of us solved the Diner room. Again, great fun, great puzzles, and a large enough space so we all fit very comfortably and had plenty of different puzzles to work on simultaneously. They are also very competitively priced. Less expensive than some rooms we have visited, yet so much better!We highly recommend Quicksand Escape Games."

I came recommended from a friend and did not disappoint. I had not been to an escape room before so did not know what to expect. It was engaging, challenging, and a lot of fun. Would highly recommend for anyone that likes a challenge and is looking for something different/fun to do."

The hosts are amazing and extremely accommodating as we were running late. They were very professional and knowledgeable and absolutely made the experience so much better! We attacked the Speakeasy Nouveau and got out with minutes to spare. There were a few minor hiccups however the hint system and the quick response by Andy kept the game flowing! All in all, Quicksand Escape is one of my top favorite escape rooms! I've completed The Diner, the Speakeasy, and Chinatown to date!"
