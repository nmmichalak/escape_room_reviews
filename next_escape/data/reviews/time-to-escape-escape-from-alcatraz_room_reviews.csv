I cannot explain how great the staff was and how great the Alcatraz Room was. It was a little weird being in a room for 8 strangers at first, but it was really cool how quickly we were all laughing and cracking jokes with each other. I LOVED this experience!"
"Escape room ""Escape from Alcatraz 1962"" by Time to Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/time-to-escape-escape-from-alcatraz,3,"Our 7, 8, and 15 year old all enjoyed it. They worked together and my husband and I worked together, and then we all worked together, it was awesome. Minimal arguing among the brothers as we stayed focused on the overall goal. We did the tomb experience (I picked it over Alcatrez, before I knew all my boys wanted the challenge of escaping Alcatrez, lol), but they still had fun and were engaged. This is one of the few places you can bring kids under 12. My youngest who will soon be 8 wasn't engaged for the full time, but he was captivated exploring the room for more than half of the experience, so I'd call that a win. "

My friends and I went to celebrate a birthday. We arrived 15 minutes early as recommended to complete our waiver forms. The waiver forms were super simple and it only took us 30 seconds to fill it out. There was only one lady working that evening and she was super friendly! Also, the waiting area and restrooms were neat and clean. We did Escape From Alcatraz with a group of 10 people and had a great time! The room set up is really awesome and it will definitely force you to work together. We completed the room with the help of a few clues from the staff when we were stuck and we made it out with only 1 minute left! We had a great time and we will definitely be returning to try King Tut's Tomb. "
