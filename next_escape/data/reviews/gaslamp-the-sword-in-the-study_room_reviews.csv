"Escape room ""The Sword In The Study"" by GasLamp in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/gaslamp-the-sword-in-the-study,0,"One of the most well-designed escape rooms I've visited, in terms of production quality and theme. Our team took on the debut room, The Sword and the Study. The puzzles were challenging and even better, interesting. A good mix of cognitive puzzles, critical thinking puzzles, and technical puzzles; it allowed for all team members to contribute their unique skills. A very, very good ""teamwork"" room. Highly recommended and I look forward to new future games!"
"Escape room ""The Sword In The Study"" by GasLamp in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/gaslamp-the-sword-in-the-study,1,We found this gem of a room randomly doing a search for escape rooms. Lots of fun and unique puzzles in a little space. Any room that has swords and wands a must do for us. We didn't expect much since we hadn't heard anything but we were pleasantly surprised. We found the Sword in the Study! Our Game Master was great also!
