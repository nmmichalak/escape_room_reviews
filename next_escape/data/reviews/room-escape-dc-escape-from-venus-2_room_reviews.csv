"Escape room ""Escape From Venus II: Collision Course"" by Room Escape DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/room-escape-dc-escape-from-venus-2,0,"For my boyfriend's birthday I surprised him with an escape room date! We did the Escape from Venus room, the only one that is designed for 2 people. Despite our pathetic performance (we needed multiple hints), we emerged from the room laughing and feeling closer. When it's just 2 people, you are forced to reconcile your differences in how you problem solve in order to escape the room. Given how different we are, had we done the challenge separately, we would've escaped much faster. The next time we do this, we are going to rock at this - at least that's what we tell ourselves!"
