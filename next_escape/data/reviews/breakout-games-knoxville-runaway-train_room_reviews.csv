"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/breakout-games-knoxville-runaway-train,0,"We have been faithful to the “Escape Game” company for several years but we have done all their games so we decided to branch out.I am so glad we did. We did the Runaway Train game and literally Escaped with less than a minute left.This game was totally fun and truly a well thought out Escape Game.I love their rooms they are so nice and big and we loved the staff!My absolute favorite thing about this company is that when you book a room you don’t have to share it, we really hated sharing rooms at the other company.. too many young kids and too bossy of people.We will be returning and hopefully participating in all the rooms! Also we loved the picture taking station and how you can easily share it!"

We had a blast!! The room was challenging, and Andy was great giving clues. It is a great way to not only have fun but have to work together for a common goal. We will most definitely be back."

The room looked amazing and anytime we had trouble finding clues we were assisted. We had so much fun were planning on going back in a few weeks. would highly recommend Breakout Games!
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/breakout-games-knoxville-runaway-train,3,My mom and I went to Knoxville for a concert and had time to kill so we booked runaway train! I’ve did several escape room and this one was great! The clues and everything including the introduction were very high tech compared to the others we have done. It’s easy to ask for clues and they quickly respond back thru a microphone. I’m the end we couldn’t get our but we were very close! The hour flew by and it was a lot of fun! I was disappointed we didn’t escape but there were only 2 of us so we were proud of how far we got! One screen did hang up which cost us a little time but we didn’t get the pic made where I guess u get to if u beat the room. We would definitely go do other rooms there if we were ever back in Knoxville.
