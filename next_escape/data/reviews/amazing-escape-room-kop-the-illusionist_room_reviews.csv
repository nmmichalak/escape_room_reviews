"Escape room ""The Illusionist"" by Amazing Escape Room in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/amazing-escape-room-kop-the-illusionist,0,We had such a fun time in The Illusionist room. We beat the clock by 7 minutes. We had two people who had done one before (they didnâ€™t win theirs) and six people who experienced an escape room for the first time. We highly recommend this escape room!

The challenge of the room was good, and I really liked the way the flow of events made sense logically. There was a nice mix of puzzles and activities that you needed to figure out. This variety forced us to use teamwork and allowed moments for all members of our group to contribute. We felt a great sense of accomplishment when we escaped, theme was cool, and the ending is very cute. Game masters Krissy and Zak really helped make it fun for our group. Recommended!"

Great for beginners and people who has already done escape rooms.It was challenging and fun at the same timeThe people running it are so fun and enthusiastic - they get you very excited for the room at the beginning.
