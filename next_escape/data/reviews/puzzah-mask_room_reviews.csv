"Escape room ""M.A.S.K."" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-mask,1,Very unique escape room!   We have played hundreds and have never played any like THE MASK.  I would recommend it for players who want to try all automation! Staff was super wonderful!  They definitely enjoy there work.
"Escape room ""M.A.S.K."" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-mask,2,"I actually visited Puzzah! as a field trip for an architecture class, the Architecture of Fun! The class divided into groups and we each got to experience an escape room. My team did M.A.S.K. and we completed the room with 2.5 minutes remaining! It was a lot of fun and well made. I've done a couple other escape rooms in Denver and Portland, and this one was my favorite so far. Plus the staff is really nice and we got a chance to talk to them after. Highly recommend!!"
