"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Butte in Butte",https://worldofescapes.com/butte/quests/escapology-butte-budapest-express,1,Went with some friends and it was so much fun! We went through the Budapest Express barely finished before the time ran out. Laughed a bunch. The lady who was our guide was very friendly and helpful. We even enjoyed the wait time as there were drinks and mind games and riddles to fill the time.
