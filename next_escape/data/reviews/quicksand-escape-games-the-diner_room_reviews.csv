"Escape room ""Diner"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-the-diner,0,"Awesome escape rooms! We did both The Diner and Speakeasy - both incredible rooms, though my favorite was The Diner (and has now become my favorite room I've ever done). You can't go wrong with either room though. Creative puzzles to solve, lots of fun and unique twists - truly the most enjoyable escape room I've done as compared to several others around the nation. Owners/designers were fun to visit with afterwards. Definitely visit this place if you are ever in the San Diego area!"

I've done a handful of escape rooms, and I don't want to be told answers. We got out with 6 minutes left and only needed one clue, and it wasn't an answer, just a gentle nudge in the right direction. Highly recommend!"

The puzzles are well designed, with appropriate clues provided. Our solving experience was very logical, and I love how appropriate the decor was! We had a lot of fun and look forward to returning for more!"

We did the Diner room, and it was one of our favorites of the weekend! Production value was high, and we had so much fun escaping this room! I look forward to coming back and trying the Speakeasy room soon!"
