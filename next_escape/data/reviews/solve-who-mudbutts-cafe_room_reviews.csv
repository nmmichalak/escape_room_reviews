We had an absolute blast!!!! You are given a starter story, taken through the crime scene, see the interrogation of suspects, comb through evidence, and try to figure out who dun it!!!  So much fun and things to keep you guessing!!! Can't wait to try the other room and see what else they come up with.........planning on expanding with two more areas!!!!  The guy running the ""investigation"" was really friendly and fun!!!!  Great job!!!!"

The amount of work the owners have put into putting everything together is so visible. The creativity, effort, and hard work shows. The owners are also USN Veterans and I love supporting veteran entrepreneurs. The small business vibe is real and the passion is evident.As for the actual interaction. The crime scene is witty. I don't know anything about murder mystery but I do know that playing detective was super fun. The humor they add throughout the whole experience is a cherry on top. Take a date, a group of friends, or just do a meetup at Solve Who one of these days. You won't regret it! :) It's one of those activities that's really fun to do if you want to have an ice breaker too. It gets everyone working together and thinking collectively."

Just go, you will not be disappointed.You don't have to be super puzzle solver guy/gal, anyone can join in.  Don't get me wrong, they can be challenging; the more effort you put it the more fun you'll have. You can play in groups or just one or two, personally I think the sweet spot is four people because there is a time limit.  My wife and I played and got though it just fine and it was fun from start to finish. The host (sorry forgot his name) is awesome, personable, professional and really created a unique and fun time.  The amount of detail and comedy is well thought out and everywhere you look."
