"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Xtreme Park Adventures in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/xtreme-park-adventures-the-bunker,0,"My small work team came to Xtreme Park Adventures for an afternoon of team building. We were set to do an escape room and then laser tag. My team enjoyed the (""bunker"") escape room so much that we wanted to use the rest of our time to complete it (instead of playing laser tag). The team was extremely flexible, helpful and made sure we had a great experience. Can't thank the guys @ Xtreme Park Adventures enough â€” we will definitely be back!"
