"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Escape Room 5280 in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-5280-jacksonville-sherlock,0,"This place was one of the best escape rooms I had ever visit! At first, we were sketched out by the area (downtown Jax) and the safety of the room, but the game master assured us about our safety (not to mention that there was an emergency code to escape). A group of us reserved the Sherlock Game and enjoyed the challenge! We were left with 5 minutes left when we escaped and every one of us had a blast. I am most likely coming back and recommending this to everyone I know!"

All the puzzles made logical sense and fit well with the story. While the technology and scenery were fairly simple, there was a variety of hands-on puzzles beyond just finding 4 digit codes and keys. Sometimes escape rooms use fancy scenery to mask flawed game design and puzzles. This place is the exact opposite. The puzzles and game are the stars of the show. The old house located in the downtown area adds an intriguing twist that you won't find at your traditional strip mall escape rooms. We had to walk up the stairs to the second floor to get to the room. There are certainly flashier (and more expensive) escape rooms in the Jacksonville area. But if you want a fun and unique experience with solid puzzles and minimal distractions, I highly recommend giving this place a try. The owner was awesome as well. He took plenty of time to talk to us about our experience and definitely made us feel like welcomed guests."

The puzzles were logical and made sense. They were difficult but I didnt get frustrated like I had in some escape rooms before. This particular room was low tech, but really worked out better that way. Less distractions so I felt happier working the puzzles. The owner was very helpful and friendly. The outside of the building was under construction, so it didn't look like a business but the address was correct."
