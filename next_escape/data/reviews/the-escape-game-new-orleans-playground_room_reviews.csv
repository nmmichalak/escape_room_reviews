"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-playground,4,Absolutely phenomenal. The rooms are so well planned and executed that you spend just as much time admiring their handiwork as you do working out the solutions to the puzzles. Our group tackled Playground and Black Ops and had a fantastic time in both rooms. The staff is friendly and helpful and really make go out of their way to make sure you have a great time. You can clearly tell that they love their jobs and have fun running the games for people. Can't wait to go back and experience the last 2 rooms and hope they bring more great games in the future.
