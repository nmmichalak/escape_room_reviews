"Escape room ""Crusader's Alley"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-crusaders-alley,0,"The Crusaders Alley was clever but it felt like there was a lack of clues to guide you through. We just ended up banging on and moving things while taking wild guesses. In the end, we didn't finish, but it wasn't a particularly well-planned room."

We loved Crusader's Alley, and have now sadly completed every room at the Montclair location.The staff was super friendly, and pointed us in the right direction during our experiences which made it fun and allowed us to continue thinking critically and imaginatively. Can't wait for them to change up the rooms in Montclair so we can return!"

If you go you must check out Crusader's Alley. It's good for the family, friends or well anyone but be sure to bring a group of at least 4 for maximum room exploration. My 9-year-old son loved it and we're already making plans to come back!"
