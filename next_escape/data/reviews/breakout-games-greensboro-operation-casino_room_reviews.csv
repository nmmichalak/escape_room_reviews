It was challenging and fun! Finished with 3 mins or so to spare. Ross was a great game-master, too. Perfect “hint” style!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-operation-casino,2,This was my first time there and I didn't know what to expect. We played Operation Casino with another couple and it was awesome. We were able to escape the room with 6 minutes left. I would definitely be back to try the other game rooms.

So much fun. The casino is definitely more challenging than heist but our game master, Stewart, was amazing. There when we needed him, but still challenging us. Awesome activity for a night out if you want to mix things up a bit and think outside the box."
