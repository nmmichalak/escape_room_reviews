"Escape room ""The Atlantis Treasure Hunt"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-the-atlantis-treasure-hunt,0,"My brother, my husband, and I have been there a few times now and have had a blast every time. The Time Machine game was the first Codebreakers game we attempted. Although we did not escape the first time, we don't give up and kept trying until we escape which we did on our fourth try.My husband and I attempted the Atlantis game the day before our anniversary and again on my husband's birthday. We didn't escape either time (it was just the two of us which makes it more difficult) so we're trying again in a few weeks.The staff and owner are friendly and personable."

Codebreakers is a great escape room business. The lobby and restrooms are clean and neat. The game itself was neat, uncluttered and well lit, with plenty of room to move about. Our gamemaster was Corrine who was spot on giving us clues when we needed extra help. (Thx, Corrine!) The game was well decorated and challenging. This room is a great family room that would appeal to any age. (We are both over 60 and loved it!) I would recommend this business to locals and travelers alike."

We did the Atlantis themed escape room. Got to say, got the best of us  Luis, the employee, was very sweet and was very patient with us. Its also very clean in there! Time sure flies by! Many of us were so close and managed to figure some clues out but geez! Lol we overall had so much fun! And definitely recommend this place. We most likely be going back to try the time machine escape room!! great experience for us first timers!"
