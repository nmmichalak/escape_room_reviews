""Clock Tower"" was well decorated and the clues were great! They didn't make it out in time, but were pretty close! (They were thankful for the clues the Escape The Room gave them when they were fully stuck.) We will definitely be back!"

However, the second room was not reset properly before we entered and only managed to make it to the next room due to dumb luck. I think it cost us a little time and therefore we were unsuccessful with one puzzle to go."

We made it with 5 minutes to spare. 10 people in the room was a bit much as we all couldn't collectively look at the same clue at the same time. That being said, we made it work and those of us not actively working on the clue spent time scouring the room and finding bits and pieces needed for the next step. Good fun."
