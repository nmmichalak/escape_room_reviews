"Escape room ""Inventor's Workshop"" by The Greatest Escape Games in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/the-greatest-escape-games-inventors-workshop,0,We did the Inventor's Workshop and barely beat the clock. We had to work together to get the answers. Solving the clues took everyone; and even our 11 year old got one big piece. The props were very professionally made. They had spent a lot of time setting the scene. The 15 year old also got into it as we all did but she led the team. We were breathless as we revealed the answer and cheered loudly. We would go again!!!! Worth it!

I was in the inventors room and it was very fun! Be prepared to seriously strategically think though, it was very challenging and we needed a few clues. Everyone who was in the Cabin said they had lots of fun too! This was a great team building exercise and I would definitely recommend this Escape Room. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating!"

The whole family enjoyed this challenge and the set up of this room. We didn’t solve it, but had loads of fun figuring out a lot of the puzzles. The staff was very courteous and helpful. We can’t wait to return and try the other rooms!"
