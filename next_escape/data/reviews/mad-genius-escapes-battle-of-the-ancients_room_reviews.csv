"Escape room ""Battle of the Ancients"" by Mad Genius Escapes in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/mad-genius-escapes-battle-of-the-ancients,0,Great escape room and such wonderful staff. Really had a great time!
"Escape room ""Battle of the Ancients"" by Mad Genius Escapes in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/mad-genius-escapes-battle-of-the-ancients,1,"A group of four of us played The Cat Lady and The Battle of the Ancients. We have done a ton of escape rooms (between 50-100 depending on the player) and we all loved it. Both rooms were fun, clever, and had elements we had never seen before. The puzzles were hard enough to challenge us, but very logical and possible to solve. The owner was very friendly and chatted with us a bit afterward. We loved that he was involved in the puzzle design (instead of just buying the puzzles from someone else) and it really showed in pride of ownership and customer service. We love supporting local businesses and this company is well-worth supporting! Great rooms, great experience!"
