"Escape room ""Lost at Sea"" by Lake Escape in Lake Ozark",https://worldofescapes.com/lake-ozark/quests/lake-escape-lost-at-sea,1,Lake Escape is awesome! We were there yesterday and it was great. We did the Lost at Sea room with our kids aged 7-15 and we barely escaped. Great time had by all. Can't wait to try the other rooms. We definitely recommend trying Lake Escape.
"Escape room ""Lost at Sea"" by Lake Escape in Lake Ozark",https://worldofescapes.com/lake-ozark/quests/lake-escape-lost-at-sea,2,"Great escape room! We did ""Lost at Sea"" and really enjoyed the side mission as well as all the parts of the quest. I've done an escape room before and really liked how this establishment explained all the locks, the room set up, and backstory (with video too). Great event for a rainy day (which it was for us) when visiting Lake Ozark. Would love to come again next time we visit."
