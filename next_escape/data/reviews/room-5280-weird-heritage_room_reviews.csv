"Escape room ""Weird Heritage"" by ROOM 5280 in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/room-5280-weird-heritage,0,"This place was awesome! For many in our group, this was our first escape room and it was the perfect amount of challenge. The room we did (Weird Heritage) was extremely well thought out and the puzzles were fun and interactive. The host was funny and gave us a hint only when we really needed it."

There were six of us, including my nine-year-old daughter, and really I think you need a bare minimum of four to make this work, but the owner said you really need six. The owner is very hospitable and the clues are challenging but not impossible.We escaped with eight minutes to spare and were pretty happy about it!  Highly recommend."
