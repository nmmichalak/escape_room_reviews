"Escape room ""Bates Manor"" by Bates Motel Escape Rooms in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/bates-motel-escape-rooms-bates-manor,1,We had an excellent time! It was a perfect challenge. The perfect balance of physical and mental puzzless. Definitely recommend it. The staff no longer gives unprompted clues. I gathered that they are working really hard to consider feedback and evolve as and escape room location. By far the most grand of settings.

The clues were tough, but relevant and we were able to escape with a minute to spare. I have been to another escape room and I enjoyed the Bates Motel Escape Room much more. Another plus was the staff who was very personable and engaging who chatted with us afterwards on some questions we had as well as telling us what we did well and led to our escape. Will definitely be back with others to try out The Tomb and any future rooms they build!"
