"Escape room ""Pirates of the Seas"" by Escape Room Novi in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-novi-pirates-of-the-seas,0,"I went to the Escape Room over the weekend with friends. We were a group of five and chose to do Pirate’s Cove. The room was challenging but not overly so. The room was well decorated and I felt immersed as if I was actually on a ship. Our host, Ian, was hilarious and courteous when we needed help. I will definitely go back soon and try a new room since there’s so many options!"
