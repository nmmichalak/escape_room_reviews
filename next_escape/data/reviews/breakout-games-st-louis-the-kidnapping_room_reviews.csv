Came to town from Chicago for a haunted house convention and it was well worth the 30min drive. My group got out of the Kidnapping room with only 6:30 to spare. Mason gave some good clues without giving anything away!

This was our first trip to Breakout Games but these were our 10th and 11th escape rooms overall. These were challenging, interesting rooms! There were loads of puzzles/locks we've never seen before. High quality, solvable puzzles. The two Game Masters we had, Logan & Julie, were incredibly awesome. Everything is clean, well thought out and we will definitely be back to do the other two rooms! Couldn't recommend it more."
