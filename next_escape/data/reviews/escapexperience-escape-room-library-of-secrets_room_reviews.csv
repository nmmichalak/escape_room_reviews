"Escape room ""Library of Secrets"" by EscapeXperience Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapexperience-escape-room-library-of-secrets,0,My friends and I had a good time. We have tried many in the area. The only problem we had with the library room was one of the props didn’t work properly and caused us not to complete the room. The monitor came in after time was up and was unable to focus the prop. It’s hard to finish a task when the equipment isn’t working. We had fun up to that point but left a little frustrated at this problem.

Place is easy to find. Plenty of parking. Decent bathroom. We did the Library which was a cool place without too many distractions. The downside was the story didn't make any sense. There really wasn't a story to follow the rooms so we weren't really sure what the end game was. I mean - yes, to get out. But what was the reason? Usually there's a good story to go with it. Even a flimsy story. There was some residue of the previous people which gave a few clues. I appreciated that there weren't a lot of extraneous plot points. Again, nice and fun, but didn't feel like an experience per se."

Miles was helpful and was able to give clues as needed which was great since we had 2 kids with us. The only downfall was 1 of the clues didn't work the first when we had put it together. They also have a couple of colors mixed up on another clue and that slowed us down. Overall it was so much fun and and had some great surprises! We will be back.

Today we went back for The Library and barely missed making it out so we went back for another go at it this evening and made it out! First people to successfully complete The Library. It's definitely challenging. We will be back for the last game!

Every member of our family from our 11-year-old to mom and dad were instrumental in our escape. The game was challenging, but not overwhelming. We used all three clues and even though we didn't succeed in breaking out, we had so much fun and learned so much about working together. It was worth every second! And the teenagers had a blast!"
