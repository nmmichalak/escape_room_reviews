We did the playroom with our kids - ages 12, 10, and 6, and there was really something for everyone and the kids had an awesome time! We did the game master room with just the adults, and it was awesome - lots of locks and puzzles!! We have done several escape rooms and we thought these were challenging and a lot of fun. Highly recommend for all ages!!"

My (edit, ex) fianc√©, her brother, and I booked the Game Master room while looking for something fun to do in town (he's visiting, and we already did most the escape rooms in town). We found this place and booked the room, and I must say, of the 15 or so rooms I've done, this one ranks top 3, maybe even number 1 or 2. It was a simple set up (very horror themed, like Saw) with a great mix of challenging puzzles, electronic locks, and electronic switches. Just when you think you've seen every part of the room, something happens. We were so happy with the first room, we actually booked the second room right after and did The Playroom as well. That one is great for kids, as it's reminiscent of an elementary classroom, with very clever puzzles, motif, and style. Overall, a 10/10 experience. They have a new room opening at the end of the month, and we cannot wait to go back!"
