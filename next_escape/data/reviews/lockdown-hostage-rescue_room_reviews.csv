"Escape room ""Hostage Rescue"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-hostage-rescue,6,"This was our second live game escape room. We chose to do the Hostage Situation Room. It was my daughter's 21st Birthday celebration and they were very sweet to her.The room was very nicely done up. Of course, I can't give any details but we were impressed. We wanted to beat the record time of 20 minutes and came in close at 28 asking for only one clue. So we were pretty proud of ourselves. We would definitely return to this location to try another room. It was fun!!"
