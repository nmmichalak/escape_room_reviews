"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by Get Out Escape Room in Tyler",https://worldofescapes.com/tyler/quests/get-out-escape-room-time-machine,0,"We did the Time Machine room and loved it! Chris, the owner, was so much fun and created a really great atmosphere! It was definitely challenging but we did make it out with about 4 minutes to spare! We cannot wait to go back and tackle the other rooms! Highly recommend checking this place out! You won't be disappointed!"
"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by Get Out Escape Room in Tyler",https://worldofescapes.com/tyler/quests/get-out-escape-room-time-machine,1,This was our first time trying out an Escape Room and we were not disappointed! The owner was very friendly and gave us a tour before we started. We escaped from the Time Machine room which was challenging but so much fun! We will definitely be back to try the rest of the rooms. The whole experience exceeded my expectations.
