The game we did was the Jungle Gem. It was just the two of us but it was an awesome experience. The design of the room was fantastic. There was a lot of thought and engineering that went into the design of the room and it stands out! The owners were super nice and friendly, the lounge was very comfortable and the atmosphere was just great. Clues were very easy to understand from the mediator and the little videos giving you the back story of the Jungle Gem were funny. This is definitely one of our favorite escape rooms now. We can't wait to return and finish our story."

I tried the Jungle Jem and had a great time! Puzzles were immersive and fun, the owners were very welcoming and really showed they enjoy their creation. Love the fact that the rooms all connect in a larger storyline. Next vacation and I will be back!"

It was my third escape game, and I loved the experience here. Their games and puzzles are very sophisticated and high tech. There is so much to discover in the Jungle Gem room... I don't want to say too much, but you have to go and play it! They were organized, kind, and fun. The room is just so well thought out and the props are the best I've ever seen. If you've done other escape rooms, you have to give them a try. And if you're looking for somewhere to start, start here!"

This room is amazing! Totally immersive, well thought out puzzles, and a very intriguing story line that leaves you wanting more. But enough about the room, let's talk about the owners. Mike and Hayley are the true Gems ( little play on words) of Imagine Escape Games. They are so passionate about the business and you can tell in all the little details in everything they do. They have put their Brains, hearts and souls into this business and their excitement about it all is contagious!!"
