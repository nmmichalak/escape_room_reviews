"Escape room ""Knight Sky"" by Liveminds Adventure Escape in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/liveminds-adventure-escape-knight-sky,0,"If you want to get immersed in an Escape Game, this is the place. The room that we did was Knight Sky and had an amazing scene displayed for us. Everything was very well thought out and had us on our heels the whole time. Finishing 8 minutes till an hour, we felt like we accomplished a ton. We then left singing ""We Are the Champions"" blaring in our car. That's a great experience."

Right when you walk in, this place throws you into the overall premise of being LiveMind Agents! My wife and I played both rooms (escaped Pacari, lost Knight Sky). The sets were beautiful, games were really dynamic and fun. We are anticipating the release of Origins but we will have to bring more than 2 people!"
"Escape room ""Knight Sky"" by Liveminds Adventure Escape in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/liveminds-adventure-escape-knight-sky,2,"These are Hollywood level escape rooms that are insanely creative. We've visited over 50 escape rooms and this was by far our favorite!! Knight Sky is the closest we've ever been to not escaping a room and we loved the challenge. To the owners, your boy Jonathan is phenomenal. He's been our game master every time and the only employee we've ever seen there, but he multitasks like a pro and makes the experience a lot of fun. Even if you aren't into escape rooms, this place is worth it just to see the ridiculously awesome theming that went into these rooms."
