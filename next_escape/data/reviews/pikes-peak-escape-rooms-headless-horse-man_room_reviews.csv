"Escape room ""Headless Horse Man"" by Pikes Peak Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/pikes-peak-escape-rooms-headless-horse-man,0,"I did this one a little over a year ago now.  Iâ€™ve done 14 different escape rooms, and to be honest this is easily my least favorite one.  The decorations felt low budget, the hint system was terrible, and it realistically was just one puzzle.  I took my in-laws to it, it was their first escape room.  I insisted the next time they visited we do another room so they would get a better impression of escape rooms in general."

We want to come again and do the gas chamber one. It was really fun trying to solve a mystery.

Our group had so much fun figuring out the puzzles, and we loved that they had an extra puzzle after you escaped the room for those who had time left. The staff was also very friendly and made the whole experience enjoyable. We're definitely returning to try out the Death Row room."
