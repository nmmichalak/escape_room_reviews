"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by PuzzlEscape Hudson in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/puzzlescape-hudson-the-speakeasy,0,"The escape room is difficult, yet exciting. Although we did not successfully escape, the room challenged us as a group and made for a great bonding activity. The staff brings out the spirit of this escape room and were extremely helpful (not just with clues) but also throughout the booking process. This is a wonderful gift option (you can purchase vouchers online) for a date night or could serve well as a girls night out. All in all, the experience is a bit expensive for less than 3 hours, but you truly get so much out of it!"

We tried this room first since it was listed as the most difficult and were not disappointed. We could not complete the room in the allotted hour but felt quite satisfied with our effort. The rooms are well constructed and the puzzles are clever and require some thought. A lot of time has been put into the design of this place and it shows. Our Gamesmaster PJ was very in tune with our quest and gave us nudges to help us along just when we needed it. We will be returning in the near future to try some of the other rooms. If you are a fan of escape rooms, this place is not to be missed."

We came on a Sunday night and were the only ones signed up for Speakeasy. The puzzle masters were kind enough to setup a less challenging room (Wilsonâ€™s Revenge) for us! The puzzle master was very helpful at explaining the rules. We needed a few extra clues to get us through the puzzle room, but we were able to finish! We would definitely like to come back again! Highly recommended!"
