"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/breakout-games-boston-runaway-train,0,"I've been to Breakout 3 times in the last six months, and I absolutely LOVE it there! The rooms I've done (the casino, the train, and the museum) have all had great set-ups and puzzles, and a really nice variety of both types of clues and the things the clues open! And the gamemasters have all been great! I highly recommend Breakout to anyone who enjoys escape rooms!"

It was definitely full engagement from the start, sorting through the clues to get to the next step. Thankfully you can shout out for help to keep you moving forward. A great family experience - we were there with our daughter and were brain-dead at the end. We'll be back."
