We did the hostage room and had an absolute blast. Even though it was just me, him, my fiance√© and his wife, it was just as much fun as having a big group. We escaped and actually really had to work for it!! We will definitely be back for another room!!! I recommend this to anyone who wants a night of fun and something different."
