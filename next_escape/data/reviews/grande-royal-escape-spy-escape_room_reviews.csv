"Escape room ""When Words Fail - Spy Escape"" by Grande Royal Escape in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/grande-royal-escape-spy-escape,1,"I booked the British spy room for my husband's birthday not expecting much because my husband and I are veteran haunted house type people and big into mystery and puzzles BUT we were pleasantly surprised! The room was small but the puzzle made up for it in every way, we had so much more fun than I expected!The gentleman who worked the building was so friendly and helpful with any questions I had prebooking they deserve five stars just for their customer service itself, they even had no problem with me bringing my 16 month old son when I couldn't get a sitter."
