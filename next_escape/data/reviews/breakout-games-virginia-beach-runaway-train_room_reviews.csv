"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-runaway-train,0,"Best escape room in VB. The staff is very helpful/friendly and the rooms are challenging. It's nice that you aren't limited to just 3 questions....if you want to ask, you can and they are super helpful, without giving it away. We just finished Runaway Train room today-- Kat was really good. We can't wait for new rooms to try-- definitely don't waste your money w/ other escape rooms--- this is the place to go. You won't be disappointed!"
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-runaway-train,1,"Went here while on vacation with my family (3 of us total) and had minimal escape room experience in the past but enough to get by. However, with only 3 people and a difficult room choice of the Runaway Train, the odds weren't in our favor. This didn't matter at all though as our game master Cam had plenty of patience and advice for us in our struggles and even helped us close the show with a minute to spare! Couldn't have done it without him and it's safe to assume the other employees are just as helpful, but moral of the story we had a blast and would definitely return for more."
