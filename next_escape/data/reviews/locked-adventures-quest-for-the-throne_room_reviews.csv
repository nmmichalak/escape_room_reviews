"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Locked Adventures in San Marcos (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/san-marcos-ca/quests/locked-adventures-quest-for-the-throne,0,"Highly anticipated the opening of Locked Adventures and we were not disappointed! Quest for the Throne is legit! The room is quite immersive, has good puzzles and a good amount of them, and a nice soundtrack while playing the game! Puzzles are primarily Gen1, but well put together. The props are also high quality.We did the room with a group of 8 and finished with 22 minutes to go.There is plenty to do in the room and the owners Jim and Christine are very nice! If you're in the San Marcos area this is a worthy room to try out!"
"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Locked Adventures in San Marcos (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/san-marcos-ca/quests/locked-adventures-quest-for-the-throne,1,I have done over 40 escape rooms. This is an excellent room! A very cool medieval theme that really challenges your mind and your patience.  We had a team of 5 and it took all of us to figure this room out. Be prepared to think outside the box. Looking forward to coming back for future rooms.
