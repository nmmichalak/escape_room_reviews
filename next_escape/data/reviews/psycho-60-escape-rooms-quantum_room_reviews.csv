"Escape room ""Quantum"" by Psycho 60 Escape Rooms in Winston-Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/winston-salem/quests/psycho-60-escape-rooms-quantum,0,"This is an awesome team building experience. We were sent back into the 80's, having to locate the bomb and deactivate it before our 60 minutes were up. Our team would get stuck and, through hints, we would finally get another lock open. Luckily, we survived with 3 minutes left."
