We had never done one of these rooms before and we had such a good time in the murder room. We were nervous because most don't make it out but for our group the puzzles were not impossible to figure out, but could take longer for some then others. Mark our game master gave great clues and we almost made it out, I mean we just needed another minute or two. Very dramatic. It leaves you wanting more. I liked that we could sit and talk for a few minutes after in the lounge and weren't rushed out and our game master stayed and visited with us. The owner who I met before we went in, greeted us when we came out too. I can tell it's important to her that her rooms are historically accurate, and she was very kind and friendly. Can't wait to come back!"
