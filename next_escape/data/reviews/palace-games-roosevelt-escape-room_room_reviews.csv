"Escape room ""The Roosevelt Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/palace-games-roosevelt-escape-room,0,"This was my first escape room. I had an absolute blast. The puzzles were fun, varied, and some were quite tough! Our Game Master was super friendly, even letting us go back into the room afterwards to talk about the design a bit more, and catch up on puzzles we'd missed (since we divided & conquered our way through most). Loved the setting and theme -- and learned a bit about some historical figures along the way."

They're incredible, challenging, and so much fun! The production quality is spectacular. The staff is amazing. Check them out!"
"Escape room ""The Roosevelt Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/palace-games-roosevelt-escape-room,2,"Wow! Every experience I have had with Palace Games so far has been exceptional! The staff is amazing, the stories behind the puzzles are fun, and most of all, the puzzles are challenging! I have been here twice, once for the Houdini Room and once for the Roosevelt Room. Both times were fun, but I preferred the Roosevelt Room slightly more than the Houdini Room. I might also add that we escaped both times! We didn't need any hints in the Roosevelt Room and we still managed to escape in 72 minutes. One thing that was exceptional about our run in the Roosevelt Room was our host, Alan. He was funny and very helpful. If you are into escape rooms, I would definitely check out Palace Games. Their rooms are elaborate and very fun! They are making a an Edison room, so stay tuned."

We skipped right to the Roosevelt Room and were impressed with the design, intricacy and overall production quality. It was cool that the story was also designed with the history of the Palace of Fine Arts in mind. Will be back to try out the Houdini Room!"
"Escape room ""The Roosevelt Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/palace-games-roosevelt-escape-room,4,I had a great time. The attention to detail is awesome and the puzzles are very thoughtfully set up. Also got a little bit of a history lesson and got to know about all the wonderful people that this room pays tribute to.Also from what my friends tell me this is the best escape room they've been to.

The detail and sophiscation of the room is ridiculous! I would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you don't fancy yourself a puzzle person (I'm not!) there is something for everyone."
