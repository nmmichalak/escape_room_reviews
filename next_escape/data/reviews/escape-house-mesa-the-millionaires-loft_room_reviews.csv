"Escape room ""The Millionaire's Loft"" by Escape House Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-house-mesa-the-millionaires-loft,0,We had such a great time doing the millionaires loft here!  We have done escape rooms in multiple cities around the US and this was one of the best!  The staff made us feel so welcome and made sure we had a great time!  The room was very unique and challenging and we were able to finish it with only a minute to spare. We used a couple hints and they were well thought out giving just enough to point us in the right direction but not just giving away free information. I recommend this place to anyone that enjoys an hour of great family friendly fun!  We will definitely be back to try the other rooms!

"Escape room ""The Millionaire's Loft"" by Escape House Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-house-mesa-the-millionaires-loft,2,"We had a great anniversary at Escape House Mesa. One of the owners, Adam, was our gamemaster, and he showed us a super time. (Thanks, Adam!) We did ""The Millionaire's Loft"" and had a blast! Adam gave us just the right amount of help when needed. We escaped with 38 seconds left. We had such fun, we signed up for ""The Detective's Office"" immediately afterward. We can't wait to do ""Flood the City"". I would say that this business is a ""must-do"" escape room experience for newbies and experienced pros alike. If you like puzzles, you will like Escape House Mesa."
