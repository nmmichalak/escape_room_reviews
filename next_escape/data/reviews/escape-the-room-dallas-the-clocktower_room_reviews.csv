Glad they went as a group and booked the whole room. I think for the first time going, a little more instruction would have been helpful. The clock tower is extremely well done and as this was our first escape room, it was not what I expected. The clues are much more involved than I had imagined and really do make you think. Great family or party activity. "

We had 2 adults, 13, 10, and 6 yr old children participate. Everyone was able to contribute to solving different puzzles. We would like to go again and do the Western Bank Heist."
