"Escape room ""Midnight on the Bayou"" by Red Lantern Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/red-lantern-escape-rooms-midnight-on-the-bayou,0,"My group and I escaped ""Midnight on the Bayou,"" and we all had a really great time. The tasks were arranged such that most of us buddied up to tackle different parts, and we all became very engaged in our separate tracks. So even though we all did the same room, each of us had an individual experience.The effects were really well done, the tasks were a good difficulty level, and each one felt like an accomplishment. Our host(/MC) was very entertaining, gave good hints, and really added to the atmosphere of the place. Not to mention, the story was compelling, creepy, and really engaging.If I could magically forget the clues, I'd be more than willing to do it over."
"Escape room ""Midnight on the Bayou"" by Red Lantern Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/red-lantern-escape-rooms-midnight-on-the-bayou,1,"This was my 5th escape room and definitely my favorite. The plot is very well thought out and immersive, the puzzle chains were challenging without being impossible, the integration of the tech with the room was very innovative and the set was artistically beautiful. The staff was very friendly too. I very highly recommend it if you like escape rooms."
"Escape room ""Midnight on the Bayou"" by Red Lantern Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/red-lantern-escape-rooms-midnight-on-the-bayou,2,"I was fortunate enough to beta test this game. I was in a group of about 8 players, some of them seasoned, some were new. The waiting room is nice and comfy with a few puzzles to bide your time (and one puzzle which I still am bitter over not solving). The bathroom is well kept and spacious. The staff is really nice and clearly put this room together with a ton of love.The room itself was really cool - very different from the others I've played as the game itself had a full story from beginning to end, and everything you did within the room related directly to the story. The room is very spacious to accommodate larger parties. My friend I went with was really jumpy - she was afraid of being scared and the funniest thing about that is that nothing in it was overtly scary. I've already recommended this game to my aunt for my niece's birthday, as she's always wanted to try an escape room and I can guarantee this is a room she'd enjoy and wouldn't be frightened by.There are some really challenging puzzles and tasks in this, and some that are a little more intuitive to solve. At the end of it, our group had succeeded! Yayyy! I really loved the more detailed plot and the love that was put into this escape room."
