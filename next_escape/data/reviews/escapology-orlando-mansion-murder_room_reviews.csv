"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-mansion-murder,0,"What a great escape room place!  Easy to book a reservation and a good number of experiences to choose from.  Your group is the only one in your experience, which is great!We chose the Mansion Murder experience and it was fun and well thought out.  I would recommend the children be 10 and above to participate with the clues. The facility is clean and the staff are very nice.  Wristbands and a water at the end of the experience was a nice touch!"

Matt, Zach and Erica were awesome hosts and I'm definitely coming back. My team did the Murder Mansion and it was hard but once you get the riddles the end result is entertaining! Thanks for making our team outing so much fun!!"

I hadn't realized that I chose the Murder Mansion which is 2nd hardest room, so that is probably why we didn't finish. John, our Game Master & Escapologist, was very helpful & very thorough in explaining everything afterwards. I wasn't discouraged because we didn't finish & would DEF go back to try another room, maybe the easiest one."
