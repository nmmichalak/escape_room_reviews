"Escape room ""Old West Heist"" by Colorado Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/colorado-escape-silence-of-the-lamb,0,"We did this to celebrate my son's 30th birthday and had so much fun. The only comment I have is that it was a little confusing to find because it is in a commercial building and we weren't sure which one. Once we found the place, though, the staff was very good. "

The room was set up nicely. Wasn't too hard, but wasn't overly complicated. You must go to this room."
