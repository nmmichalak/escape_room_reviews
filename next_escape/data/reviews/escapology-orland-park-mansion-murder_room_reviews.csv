"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-mansion-murder,0,"My wife and I had a lot of fun in the Mansion Murder game. The story was compelling, and the room was high quality. We'd like to try one of the other rooms soon... maybe with the family. Our Game Master Janine was helpful... but not TOO helpful. I highly recommend trying this out."
"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-mansion-murder,1,This is the first time I had done an escape room. I took my 3 teenage boys. We had a blast! We did the Mansion Murder. It was very challenging but we were able to figure it out and escape!!! The staff Nicole and Kelly made the experience even better!!! We cant wait to go back and try a different room!!!

The Mansion Murder mystery room was great, fun details, interesting puzzles and definately on the harder side if you have younger kids. Atmosphere was great! We'll definately go back."
