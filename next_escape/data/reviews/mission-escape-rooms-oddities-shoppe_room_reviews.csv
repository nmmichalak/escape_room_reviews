The puzzles in the Oddities room were wonderfully challenging and fun. We had an amazing time and escaped with just a few minutes to spare! Such a fun experience!

We went for the last scheduled hour of the day in the middle of the week and lucked out to have the room for ourselves. Lena and John were both incredibly nice and helpful to escape room noobs like us. We ultimately made it out, but it was certainly a challenge. Tons of cool little antiques, riddles, and other puzzles. The integration of everything was amazing. I highly recommend the experience! Thanks John and Lena!"
