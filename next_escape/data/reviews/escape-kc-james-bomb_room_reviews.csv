We did the James Bomb room and everyone had a blast - literally - we didn't succeed in stopping the bomb, but we were close! The staff was wonderful! They helped to make it more fun, were patient with screaming girls and were helpful when we needed it. Thank you!"

The staff was very energetic and got you involved from the very start. James Bomb was different than the other escape room I had done before but I loved it. I was very nervous with knowing I was going to be handcuffed but it made it more intense, even if the handcuffs weren't the most comfortable things in the world. We were so close to getting out at the end we had all of our clues but just didn't look at one thing. I would love to go back and see how the other room is."

We did the James Bomb room, just the three of us. It was a tricky room, and we didn't finish in time, but I thought we did well for being only one adult and two kids! And regardless, we had a blast. We appreciated the clues that were able to be provided to us as well."
