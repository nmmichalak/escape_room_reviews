"Escape room ""Magic Wonderland"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Magic-Wonderland,0,"Did the Magic Wonderland room as a family and successfully escaped! Had a wonderful time! Wasn’t so difficult that my 8-year-old couldn’t participate, yet the adults in the room, a few experienced game room connoisseurs, found it challenging. We will definitely return!"
"Escape room ""Magic Wonderland"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Magic-Wonderland,1,This is a great place to bring family and friends. We came here and had a blast! (We did the Magic Wonderland room with family of 4 and my wife.) The technology is cool and staff were really friendly. We will come back again!
