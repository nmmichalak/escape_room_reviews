Had never done an escape room, but would highly recommend it. This was a team-building event for the office. We reserved two rooms and split into groups of six for each room. The ""Death Row"" room, considered intermediate, was a challenge. We thoroughly enjoyed it and completed it in 48 minutes. What a fun way to spend some time with friends, coworkers, family members, and really use your brain. You'll enjoy this!"

We did the Death Row Room, amazingly well done!! Every detail was great. We will for sure all be returning to solve another room's mysteries. Suggestion .. only that it'd be fun to have a small champagne toast at the end for a celebration, even non alcoholic would be great, just a Toast to Team Work Well done!! Thank you for a fun evening!!"
