HiLarious!We did the Casino Room. Between my Dad's math skills, my Mom's love for mysteries and private eye things and my friends love for games I figured we might have a chance.We got further than I was thinking we would based on how we began  but we didnt crack the code but we had so much fun.#Sunshine our Game Master was great on allowing us to fiddle and get confused and only popping in with clues if absolutely needed. We got stumped plenty of times.We will be baCK."

Can't wait to try the other rooms. We barely broke out of Casino Royale. Sam was super friendly and gave us the opportunity to solve the clues on our own with the amount of help we asked for.
