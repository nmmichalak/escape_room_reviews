"Escape room ""7 Dwarfs"" by Once Upon An Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/once-upon-an-escape-7-dwarfs,0,"Went here with just two of us over the weekend and were encouraged by the other good reviews for this business.  First of all they are a family run business so that is nice.  They offer several different 'fairy tale' themed rooms and we chose the 7 Dwarfs room.  The rooms were very well themed and each room you progressed to had a number of different riddles to solve (though a lot of the puzzles were related to opening locks).  They also don't limit the number of hints you can get and the hits are delivered through text which is also kinda helpful.  In terms of difficulty I would rate the 7 Dwarfs room maybe a 4 out of 10, but we have also done a lot of escape rooms so my sense of difficulty may be off a bit.  The rooms are not scary at all so could be a good fit for a family with kids.  They also offer a local's discount so that is nice.  We'll be back to try another of their rooms some time soon as we very much enjoyed ourselves."

This place isn't ""Disney"" but they make a play on the stories. We did ""Seven Dwarfs"" and had so much fun figuring it out. We went at 10 pm and the staff was still so kind and excited to have us even though I'm sure they were tired and close to closing time. We've done a few escape rooms in Vegas and this was by far our FAVORITE room and staff! You seriously can't go wrong. We cant wait to go back and do them all. Especially can't wait for ""Neverland"" to get done."

It wasn't too hard, which was good since most of our group had done one or no games before. Definitely consider this location if you're looking for a locally owned experience"
