Michelle was friendly and informative, and the pirate ship room was amazing. We did need to ask for help, but we laughed, high-fived, and had a blast along the way. The clever setup and a few surprises made this worth every bit of the anticipation. Looking forward to another adventure sometime!"

The place was clean and everything was prepared and ready to for us to have a great adventure. We all left being super impressed and can't wait to return for another puzzle.
"Escape room ""Hunt for the Dead Sea Souls"" by Complexity: A Puzzling Adventure in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/complexity-a-puzzling-adventure-the-pirate-ship,4,My girlfriend and I did the pirate ship room. I was hoping to not use any clues but the puzzles were more complex than I thought they would be! We had to use a handful. By the end I was sweating and my adrenaline was pumping! What a great time! The staff was SUPER nice and helped put us at ease (my girlfriend was worried about being in an enclosed room). We wish we lived closer so we could do the rest of the rooms. This was our very first puzzle room and it was a blast! But now we feel like no other puzzle room will compare :) Thanks again for the fun!
