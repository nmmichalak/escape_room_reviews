"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-operation-casino,1,"We've had two great experiences at Breakout Games in Timonium! On our first trip, we escaped the Casino room with the excellent guidance of Andrew. Andrew did a great job explaining the concept as this was our first escape room and made our time at Breakout a great experience! Our second room was great as well - as we escaped ""Museum Heist"" with the awesome guidance of Amie. Both Amie and Megan were wonderful in helping us out during and after.  We would highly recommend this business to anyone looking to do a fun escape room!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-operation-casino,2,Went with my family - 6 of us in total - and did the Casino room. It was really awesome and we had a lot of fun. Escaped with less than 2 minutes remaining!

We escaped the Casino and had a lot of fun doing it! Our game master, Michelle, was very helpful and attentive. The puzzles were very linear so we probably wouldn't recommend more than 5-6 players per room. These are great rooms for people who are new to escape rooms, though we also had fun as veterans. We will definitely go back and do their other rooms!"

We booked the Casino room and when we got there, we were paired with another group of 4. We all worked together and escaped the room in 46 minutes! We couldn't stop talking about our experience all day! The staff was super friendly as well.  We will definitely be back!"
