"Escape room ""The Big Score"" by Project Escape in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/project-escape-the-big-score,0,"We have done several escape rooms, this is our second favorite so far. We did The Big Score - Theft of the Millennium Diamond. We did not have a big enough team, so we failed - really recommend 8-10 people in this one. Nevertheless - fun was had.Relied on more that padlocks and combinations, there was definitely a difficulty level. Enjoy."

I really didn't know what to expect, and once we started our mission, it was so nice to see everyone working together towards finding the clues and how they piece together! The staff was so nice, and wanted us to succeed! We are definitely coming back!"
