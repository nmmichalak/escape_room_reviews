"Escape room ""Fallout"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-fallout,0,"The rooms and puzzles were really well made, and tricky! I recommend the fallout themed room, though the rest of my teammates really liked the zombie room as well."
"Escape room ""Fallout"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-fallout,1,"Let me start by saying that I have done 30+ rooms, and this place is at the top of for me - for a number of reasons. We intended on doing 2 rooms during our friends outing... and ended up doing 3 - they are that good and that fun.First we did the Time Collector - and all of the geeky elements put into this game are a nerd's (my) dream. On top of the fact that the puzzles were very well put together and each room was incorporated in the puzzles more than once - and that's true of all of their games that we played. We beat this (their ""easiest"" room with 7:58 left). The second game we did was Fallout, which was their second hardest room, and it didn't disappoint. Very solid in terms of puzzles, types of puzzles and tech, and layout (very unique). We beat this one with 10:58 left. We were done with the bookings that we made ahead of time, then decided to see if we could do one more. We opted for Si's and Mic's (which we read as See's and Mike's, but it's Sy's and Mick's - like Seismic's - like and earthquake - and that turned out to be awesome as well. This one has some unique puzzles, layout, and tech. We beat this one was just over 12:00 to go. I cannot say enough great things about this place. From the quality of puzzles, to the friendliness of the staff, this place is perfect."

The rooms are so well thought out and the props are crazy impressive. We’ve had anywhere from 2-7 people and had fun in all of them. They give you just enough clues when you need them so you don’t get stuck or frustrated. The puzzles are so unique, too, and observation skills are critical! Highly recommend this place."
