"Escape room ""Hero League"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-hero-league,0,"Have done over 20 Escape Rooms in the Tampa Bay area (Because once you've done one you just HAVE to do more, am I right?) and Outerlife Studios is our top pick. All three of their rooms have blown our minds with the brilliant mechanics and completely different ideas. Some escape rooms lead you from lock to lock to lock, but Outerlife has very clever puzzles that make the experience very immersive.Their newest room Hero League DRAT has some very ingenuous use of space. Any hesitation about it being a ""mobile"" escape room instantly dissipated as soon as my team and I stepped in. This is very well another top notch addition to their other two rooms and can't recommend it enough.Now, what makes outer life even greater is their staff, we have loved geeking out with their team, they are warm, welcoming and engaging, and really make us want to come back for more (hurry up and make more rooms ASAP, please). It doesn't hurt that its also a great location near central ave with fantastic walking distance to plenty of drinking and dining options nearby for you to debrief with your team.TLDR, one of the best escape rooms experiences in Tampa Bay. If you've done their previous two rooms, come do their third one, you will not regret it at all."
"Escape room ""Hero League"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-hero-league,1,"As a huge fan of Outerlife Studios, I was definitely curious about their new mobile escape room, Hero League/D.R.A.T (Destructive Roaming Armored Transport). I’ve done many escape rooms (some even international) and have had a wide range of experiences and each time Outerlife still is at the top of my list.First off, the owners are really cool, chill people who clearly love doing this. They love to debrief after and love seeing people excited after exiting their rooms. Each room has an element you don’t expect, so win or lose you’ll have a blast in each room.So with our prior experience with Outerlife in mind, we were curious to see how this new Hero League D.R.A.T. room would be.Overall, we were over the moon happy and loved the whole experience! If I could erase my brain and do it again I happily would.The story was well thought out and the acting in the videos added to your excitement. The technology was excellent and really immersed you further into the story. I can say one aspect of this room had us absolutely floored had to do with the color green - when you do the room you’ll understand.The puzzles flowed well and added to the story and everything made sense - sometimes a pet peeve of mine is when you have to solve a puzzle for no reason. Not a single key with locker lock in the whole room, which is exciting for anyone tired of endless find-the-key-and-correct-lock of many other escape companies.The puzzles also requires a good bit of teamwork which is really fun and had us giggling with excitement the whole time. We had a team of 6 and we never felt cramped or in each other’s way which I was definitely wondering about when we first got in. It was surprisingly spacious.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this room and would say Outerlife continues to stand as the best escape company in the Tampa Bay Area. I loved Disarm and Scorched and can definitely add the new Hero League D.R.A.T. room to that list. Now I have to wait for the next room to come out ...."
