"Escape room ""Cypherspace"" by Reality Break Escapes in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/reality-break-escapes-cypherspace,0,"Excellently created escape room experience! Staff was helpful when needed, but didn't give anything away. Clues were challenging, but not too tough. We did Cypherspace and finished with 2:12 left on the clock!"

Everyone at RBE was SOOO accommodating, especially because we had some last-minute shuffling, adding someone and then someone not coming. We played Cypherspace because we needed the biggest one. They got us all in and having fun. Even with a full room there was only one time where we were waiting on a small group of people to finish something before the rest could go on, so it was well implemented. There were fun puzzles to do while we waited for the group to get there, and then they got us in and going right on schedule. Afterwards we used the gathering room to have some snacks and talk about our adventure. We're coming together as a new team, so this was a great way to see how we work and play together. We'd definitely go back!"

It was fun and challenging and the puzzles were pretty cool. I've done a few escape rooms before and there were some cool new equipment that I've not come across yet and I enjoyed that. The game runner was really cool and personable, which I always appreciate. We are already planning on our next visit and can't wait."
