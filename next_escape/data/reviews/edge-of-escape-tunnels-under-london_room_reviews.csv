It was amazing. The young ones were absolutely able to contribute and it was super challenging for the rest of us. The story, craftsmanship and creativity that went into this escape experience were so impressive. Even though we failed to escape, we had a terrific time trying. We will be back to try the other room!"

We were a little escape room challenged and needed an embarrassing large number of hints, but the owner was fantastic and willing to help us along. The facility is amazing, and we had an absolutely blast on the Tunnels Under London room. We will be back to try the other room."
