"Escape room ""Chloe"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-slc-chloe,0,"I was with a group of 4 and 4 others joined us. It was a good amount. I'm always worried of packing a room tightly, but it didn't feel like too much in this room. Chloe was scary, I enjoyed it and the room reacted to your actions. There were creepy hints being whispered to us by Chloe and it was just the right amount of hint. The only reason I don't rate this room higher is the fact that there is one point where you have to crawl through a very narrow tunnel. If you are a larger person, you won't be able to go through. The team can continue on and eventually come back and get you, but you miss out on a good portion while you wait. Other than that one thing, I really enjoyed the Chloe room and would recommend it."

Neither one of us had ever been to any escape room before, so I don't really have anything to compare? But I thought it was very well done. We went to the Chloe room. It was really hard & it was only the both of us, so I think if we had more people maybe it wouldn't of been so hard? It was scary and definitely a challenge, the staff was really nice and ""Chloe"" was great. It would be really fun to go on a double date or a bunch of friends. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the price. Like I said I don't have anything to compare, but felt like it was pricy! And I couldn't find any coupons, discounts or promotions of any kind. I thought maybe going on a weekday would be a little cheaper? But overall it was something fun and different and hopefully we can go again."

We did the Chloe Room, from what I hear it is newer and has a low solve rate. I highly recommend this if you are a thrill seeker. We had a few in our group that jump easily and they were really not much use. They were too scared to look for clues on their own! The detail, design, creepy level was on par. Do it! We did not escape in time but for sure left me wanting more. I still think about one clue and how it links to the lock... Fun times.honorable mentions: Nice air flow, not stuffy at all. Smelled good, you often feel you are going to be stuck in a room with everyone's odor going wild. Not the case here. Space to think and walk around, very large home."

First off walking in the staff was super bubbly and friendly we signed the waivers and within like 7 minutes we were heading to the room. The guy briefing us about the room was super funny and made the experience so much more fun. So we get in the room I won't spoil anything but OMG CHLOE WAS TERRIFYING she even wrote me a happy death day note the whole hour was so fun the room was amazing I was so impressed it's definitely worth the money they even had a locker to lock your stuff in with a lock at no charge definitely made my birthday amazing can't wait to come back!
