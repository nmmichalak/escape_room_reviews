We chose Whisper Sister and just made it out!! The staff was so friendly and welcoming. I had won gift certificates, so we never had heard about this place. Definitely looking forward to trying another room!"

It was Whisper Sister and the level was medium difficulty (but we are smart, so I thought why not). We were very close, actually within seconds of escaping the room when our time ran out. Our group had a ball and would definitely do it again. You really have to have a mind for puzzles and riddles to succeed. We hope to do it again and 'Escape the Room'!!!"
"Escape room ""Whisper Sister"" by Operation: Escape Room in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/operation-escape-room-time-machine,2,We are escape room operators and huge enthusiasts. We visited Operation Escape Room this past weekend while heading to Pittsburgh for another event. We thoroughly enjoyed Whisper Sister. The room has a great design starting with the decor and nicely maintained props. Puzzles were well thought out. In addition it was a clean facility with a very kind and welcoming staff.  We hope to make it back to try their 2nd room (Dixmonte).  Captain Greybeard's Trials is worth checking out for those who like to be challenged.  This will be their 3rd room and should be opening soon.  Check them out!
