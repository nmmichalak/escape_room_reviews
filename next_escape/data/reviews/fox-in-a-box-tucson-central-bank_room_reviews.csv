The difficulty was just right and it did not require too much math to solve. We had so much fun there and we will definitely come back !"

We went twice in out weeklong trip, completing both rooms. Personally we thought the bank was more fun, but the Zombie room was great too. The two owners are extremely nice, and created a creative atmosphere that we were all mesmerized by. Props to you Mr. Fox."

We really enjoyed doing both rooms this weekend. What we especially like about them is that they were 100% different and had a great variation of puzzles and clues. These were out 20th and 21st escape rooms and we will recommend it to everyone we know!
