They even escaped The Lost Ruins with 2 seconds to spare. Highly recommend this as a party place! Thanks to Kevin for making this a good experience for the boys.

I had the opportunity to play and beat both the Lost Ruins and The Gift! They were challenging but doable. I highly suggest those interested start with The Gift and later advance to more difficult ones like Lost Ruins. I will definitely be back to try the others. Shoutout to Arial for being a great game-master as well! Thank you, Red Door!"

The room itself was great, aesthetics were wonderful but the puzzles were a bit... off. some of them just didn't make sense and we had to get a lot of help from the game masters for them. Over all I definitely recommend this room."

My family and I had a great time trying to solve the puzzles. I really appreciate the amount of detail and well thought out of the Lost Ruins. It was incredibly immersive and I plan on returning!
