Very scary, great use of live actors.  Puzzles were tricky but very doable.  Staff was very helpful and engaging, gave us great advice for additional escape rooms."
"Escape room ""The Last Experiment"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-the-last-experiment,2,"Me and my friends came to do the experiment and Zoe today! I was too afraid to do Zoe but the experiment room was creepy and fun and had a live actor. It had a couple things I've never seen before in previous escape rooms. I wish I was brave enough to do the Zoe room with my friends, but the room looked REALLY scary and fun! The game master was excellent at giving hints and staying in character and made the experience memorable, and he explained the origin of the Zoe story and the rooms! Thank you so much!! I will be back when I am braver!!!"
