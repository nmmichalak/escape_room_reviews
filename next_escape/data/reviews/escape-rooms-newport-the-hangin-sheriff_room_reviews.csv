First time in an escape room, and the Sherriff’s Jail was the perfect amount of challenging for myself and my partner to do on our own. Will be back next time we are in town!"
"Escape room ""The Hangin' Sheriff"" by Escape Rooms Newport in Newport",https://worldofescapes.com/newport/quests/escape-rooms-newport-the-hangin-sheriff,1,Such a wonderful experience! It was the perfect activity for fun and bonding on a girl's weekend! The three of us did the Sheriff's theme room. The puzzles were just the right level of challenging without being frustrating. Jennifer and her husband obviously love bringing joy to their customers. Everyone should give this a try. It's SO worth the money! I can't wait to come back and bring my husband and kids!
