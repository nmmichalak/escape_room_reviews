Perfect degree of difficulty for a mixed age group (9-adult). They did Wizard of Greystone Abbey and absolutely loved it.

The location was right in Chestnut Hill and is accessible via bus or train. The house the escape room was in was adorable and clean. I did the Wizard of Greystone Abbey room. The clues were so good and they really made you work for it! The hosts were the BEST and super helpful and encouraging, which is always a good thing when you think you are about to give up. I would definitely recommend this escape room to anyone who loves witches/wizards!"
