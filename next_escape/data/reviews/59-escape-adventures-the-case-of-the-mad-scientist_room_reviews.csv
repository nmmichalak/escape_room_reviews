"Escape room ""The Case of the Mad Scientist"" by 59: Escape Adventures in Post Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/post-falls/quests/59-escape-adventures-the-case-of-the-mad-scientist,0,Super friendly service. The escape room was great! Went in with a group of 5 and it really does mentally challenge and build teamwork. Overall I think it's a great place for some family fun or dates and I can't wait to see what else they have coming!

We were a little nervous about trying this out, some worried it may be too easy or cheesy. Boy, were we super and excited while going through the Mad Scientist room! It was challenging, great fun! Unfortunately, we didn't finish with the win but we had a blast at failing!"

In this case, we took our employees here and did the Mad Scientist room. Super hard but we made it out! Creative details in the rooms and was a lot of fun seeing peopleâ€™s light bulbs turn on as we were figuring out how to escape. Highly recommend for team building or just to have a good time with some friends. We will definitely be back."
