We worked really hard the whole time and escaped with only seconds remaining. Clues are only given when you specifically ask for them which is a great way to run an escape room."

Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-spokane-soviet-spy-game,2,"We had a group of six people that got together for a friendâ€™s birthday, and we visited the Francis location for the Soviet themed room. The online instructions and over-the-phone customer service for making the reservation were fantastic, as was our face-to-face interactions with all the staff. The directions for the room itself were clear, and the staff were friendly and engaging. The location seemed clean and well-maintained, and we had a phenomenal experience. We will definitely be back!!"
