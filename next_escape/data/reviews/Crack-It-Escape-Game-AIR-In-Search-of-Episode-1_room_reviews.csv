"Escape room ""DEFCON-1 Red Alert"" by Crack It! Escape Game in Jacksonville (NC)",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville-nc/quests/Crack-It-Escape-Game-AIR-In-Search-of-Episode-1,0,Iâ€™ve done every room now at this facility and all of them are great (my favorite is definitely defcon)! Most recently Shawn was my room moderator man and he did awesome! The energy he had made the room so much more enjoyable.

Escape Game in Jacksonville (NC)",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville-nc/quests/Crack-It-Escape-Game-AIR-In-Search-of-Episode-1,1,"After playing 55+ games, I can say with certainty that the games at Cracked-It Escape are in my top 10, with their DEFCON-1 room being in my top three. The atmosphere is very welcoming along with the staff, and the lobby is very nice and clean. The puzzles were amazing, they really make you think and leave a lasting impression. Their use of simple and technologically-driven puzzles actually made me stop to appreciate the dedication that went into making such great products. Great job guys1"

Escape Game in Jacksonville (NC)",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville-nc/quests/Crack-It-Escape-Game-AIR-In-Search-of-Episode-1,3,"Fun, frustrating (In a good way) & exciting. ""Cracked it"" is loads of fun and the staff is extremely friendly. HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for something different to do with the family or a group of friends. Looking forward to coming back to finally ""crack it""."
"Escape room ""DEFCON-1 Red Alert"" by Crack It! Escape Game in Jacksonville (NC)",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville-nc/quests/Crack-It-Escape-Game-AIR-In-Search-of-Episode-1,4,"At first I was unsure what to really expect as an outcome because I have never done one of these escape rooms before. There's almost always one person who can never show up ONTIME well sure enough yesterday that was me. The staff did wait just a few minutes for us to arrive shortly after which was very satisfying had knowing we've already purchased tickets online. Well ladies and gentlemen the experience was AMAZING! Puzzles all around you to accomplish physically and mentally! The puzzles are challenging BUT fair enough for you to complete. Unfortunately we didn't escape however we were very close! At the end we received a briefing on what we were doing wrong which left everyone saying ""aw man so close"" but with a smile, because everyone had fun! Can't wait for more rooms and puzzles to open I have already recommend this place to a bunch of friends!"
