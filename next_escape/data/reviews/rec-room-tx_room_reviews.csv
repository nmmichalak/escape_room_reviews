"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/rec-room-tx,0,"Compared to other escape rooms we've done in various places, the Rec Room is easily the weakest one we've done. There are an overall limited set of puzzles and even less clues to go from. The ones you do get are highly cryptic which basically means you spend the first 30 minutes doing nothing. After that (you can only ask hints after 20 minutes) you'll get some hints from the controller and you can solve a few puzzles, but even those are all quite similar and not terribly exciting.Underwhelming experience, especially for the price you pay."

My best friend and I went to celebrate my birthday, we did the Rec room. We ended up being in the room with 4 other people who haven't done an escape the room before. It was beginner friendly and a ton of fun. And we ended up winning with a minute to spare! I will definitely be back!!"
"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/rec-room-tx,2,Loved it. I would encourage everyone to do this.  I loved the 80's room. My husband gave me this for my 50th birthday.

We did the Rec Room - which is a throw back to the 1980's and had a blast.  Only complaint... no Alf!  What gives ;) Just kidding.  Would recommend, so if you are on the fence, chose this one and go have fun!"
"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/rec-room-tx,4,Had a great time! We were grouped with strangers which at first I wasn't too keen on but once the game started going we all worked really well as a team to get out.  We did the Rec Room. 36 seconds to go and we beat it. It was not easy at all but we all had fun!No spoilers here you have to figure it out on your own. Already looking for the next one to go to in St. Louis.
