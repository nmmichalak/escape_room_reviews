"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,0,Four of us went to Saw Escape rooms Oct 2019. We all had a great time. That’s all I’ll say because I don’t want to give anything away   Be surprised and be frightened. A fun time.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,1,"Came here with a couple of my friends and it was AWESOME! Very creepy and eerie, very intricate rooms/puzzles, great acting and WELL worth the money! It’s clear a lot of thought and preparation was put into this and it REALLY shows!! Shout out to Michael and Trinity for an awesome night. We will definitely be back!!!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,2,"It was difficult, but stressfully exciting and exhilarating experiences. "
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,3,My family absolutely loved it. Arriving was the best part it felt like we were literally walking into a horror film. Bailey was awesome!! Thank you for the experience. 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,4,Great experience.  Much more difficult than I thought it was going to be.   Will be back with larger group. 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,5,Awesome sets and actors.  Best I have ever seen!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,6,We had a great time!!! 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,7,Just got back from doing this and it was really worth every dollar.  Next time I am going to do the VIP tour because you always get that over achiever when you are in a GA group.  The whole thing was insane though.   It was a giant escape room and it felt like we were in it forever.   I like the fact that they give you limited time just like in the movies because it really gives you a level of anxiety since you have such a short amount of time.  Great experience A++++++ from start to finish.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,8,This was by far the best escape room I have ever been to.  I personally LOVED the fact that the building was not marked and designed to be an old meat packing plant.  So I love reading the fact that people actually got lost finding it.  The fact that it isn't marked goes with the whole immersive theme which I LOVE.  From the moment you arrive the show has begun.  Even when you are signing your waivers the person doesn't break character at all.  The whole experience from start to finish took about 1.5 hours so plan to be there longer than a normal 1 room escape room.  The puzzles were much more difficult than I expected so we really enjoyed that.  I can't wait to go back to Vegas in the future and see what they have added.  I would highly recommend a VIP tour vs. general admission.  We paid an extra $20/person and it was so worth it.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,9,"LOVE THIS PLACE! Not like your regular escape room... so much better! The actors really bring everything to life (Drew was amazing), and the scenery is straight from the movies, just so cool. Highly recommend even if you aren't a fan of the movies! "
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,10,Read my brother Brian's review.....this place was a bust and not worth the money to just look at.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,11,"It took our Uber 20 minutes to get to the right building because they have no signage outside. All it says is egan meats which has nothing to do with SAW so noone knew where to go. You walk up to an actor who does a pretty amazing job so that made the situation a little better but then you go inside and wait another 20 to 30 minutes with an employee. They then send you into the attraction and although we really felt like we were in the movies, we didn't enjoy the experience at all. We were hoping to solve riddles and puzzles to figure everything out but we were sent around searching for numbers."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,12,Great place. Got 6/7 rooms even with strangers in our group cause we totally worked as a team! Drew was super helpful and did an amazing acting job. Loved every bit.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,13,I had a fantastic time!! Felt like I was in a movie. Only lost 2 out of 7 rooms. Can't wait to go back to win it all!! 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,14,This was such a fun game. I had my bachelor party here.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,15,AMAZING ! Best escape room yet. I love how they had an actress inside (ours was Drew) to make the experience that much more terrifying.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,16,"My wife and I just finished the escape room. We didn't make it out because of the group we were with. Pay the money for a private room.... The actor inside was useless, didn't help us get through at all. If you love escape rooms, don't go here. This is more of a tour of the SAW movies than an actual escape room.Very disappointed."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,17,"The place looks amazing but the escape room side of it was less than amazing. They seem to be more worried about making money by having multiple groups in the attraction at once than the puzzle side. As an escape room enthusiast, I would not recommend going here."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,18,"This place is absolutely amazing! Work together with your Bailey, we had Drew, she helped a ton but still kept an eerie terrifying environment. If you enjoy a little fright and a lot of fun this place is for you. "
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,19,"This place was hands down amazing! The puzzles are so much fun and challenging! The more people you have in your group the better too! The bathroom scene is my favorite, so much to find!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,20,Absolutely awesome! Loved the theme and the feel. Challenging but doable. Bailey was awesome. Merchandise saleswoman was friendly. Would definitely do again!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,21,This place is amazing! If you love the movie you will love this! If you hate or are too afraid of the movie you will still love this! Best Escape Room Ever! Took my 12 year-old son as well and he loved it. Great puzzles and experience. When you go make sure you listen to all the clues and your Bailey and WORK TOGETHER AS A TEAM!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,22,It was an amazing experience had a blast and would do it again. The actors are great and the whole escape was fun and interesting . 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,23,The Saw escape room was both challenge and had a fair amount of horror and suspense to keep you on your toes the entire time. I was constantly waiting for something to pop out to scare me and the puzzles in the rooms were awesome. Some of them definitely test your courage as well as ability to think while under a time limit.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,24,"I really love this place! I havent done too many other escapes, but if they are all like this one, I def have a new hobby! I felt like I was set straight into the movie set. There's so much to look at, and the flashlights really are an interesting part of the game LOL Once I do a few more escapes, im going back! I think I need a bit more experience to master this one!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,25,"This place absolutely blew my MIND! I've done quite a few escape rooms before and always got bored about halfway through. I liked that the actor gave a few hints along the way otherwise my group would have failed miserably. The set design is unlike anything I've ever seen, I can tell they spent a crazy amount of money on building this place along with all the tech, i've even worked on a few movie sets myself and this was far more detailed!! The games were different in every room and it was very fast paced and exciting. If you're a SAW fan you will LOOOOVE this place!! They even had an exclusive retail store where you can buy SAW product you won't be able to find anywhere else or online at amazing prices. It takes a lot to impress me these days but I've been recommending this place to everyone! I see people complaining and really have no idea why, it all made sense, flowed well and I felt I paid what its worth!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,26,"I went last Sunday and this was much harder than I thought it was going to be.  I won about half of the rooms but the last two which I won't spoil were very difficult.  Bailey was great! From start to finish we were there about an hour and 30 minutes so make sure to plan enough time.  I know on this site it says 60 minutes but we were there 30 minutes longer.  I highly recommend it, we felt like were were in the SAW movies and love the fact that it progresses to so many different rooms."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,27,Dont go! It is a waste of money. Our tour guide jamie was awful.
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,28,"The games made no sense. End of story, it was awful."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,29,I felt like I was in an actual SAW movie. This was so much fun. We will definitely be going back!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,30,"I took a group of 12 associates to the Ifficial Saw Escape Room.  It was my plan to use the event as a team building exercise. The Official Saw Escape Roomexceeded my expectations.  I could not have imagined providing a better experience for the group. The puzzles were challenging. We felt we were so close on some of them. Darn!!That being said, there was tremendous personal and group satisfaction from solving the ones we did solve. If you are an event co-ordination, bringing any size group here to Las Vegas, please consider the Official Saw Escape Room as one of your choices. It was way more fun than any ropes course I’ve ever done!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,31,I've been to a few other escape rooms and this one is by far the absolute best! I am a huge fan of the film and they have done an amazing job duplicating the rooms! The entire location is mesmerizing and perfect for the experience.  I would definitely recommend this escape room to all of my family and friends!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,32,"What a truly amazing experience! The games are extremely immersive and we had so much fun working together as a team to pass all of Jigsaw’s tests! Definitely recommend spending a little extra to do the Private VIP Experience, it’s well worth the price and the memories you’ll make with your group are priceless! Set designs are so detailed that you feel like you’re really a part of the movies! The entire staff is fantastic and had amazing customer service from start to finish! Seriously, do yourself a favor and make sure you visit this epic escape experience! Great job guys! Hope to see more locations around the country open up in the future!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,33,We went with a group of our friends and had the best time!  They thought of everything and the rooms are amazing!  Would definitely recommend!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,34,You don’t want to miss this!  So much fun and we felt like we were actually in the movie!! We will definitely be back and would recommend.  
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,35,From the moment I entered the double gates I felt like I was on a movie set.  The outside of the buildings are eerie and the escape rooms are exactly like in the movies.  I would recommend everyone going to this.  
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,36,"I had a great time going through the Saw Escape Room in Las Vegas, NV.  It is challenging and I felt like I was actually in the movie.  The rooms look exactly like the scenes in the movies.  I don't think any Escape Room in Las Vegas or anywhere else could compare to this.  It took us about an hour and a half to complete it."
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,37,Man oh man was this amazing! Anyone that visits Las Vegas needs to go here!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,38,The most thrilling and immersive escape room I have ever been to!From the moment you walk up to the gates you are nervous because you don't even know if you are in the right spot. You are greeted with the most amazing customer service and are in the escape room for roughly an hour and 15 minutes. The games are difficult and extremely fun. I would recommend to anyone and everyone!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,39,"This escape room is by far detailed beyond expectations. Arriving at the location already gives you a feel that you are entering a near movie studio set.The staff is super friendly and professional, explains everything that is about to happen....and then it's go time!Once you are in the facility, it mirrors so much from the movie SAW! The puzzles are very detailed and not an easy task...however when you get done with one room, you are onto another room!It takes over an hour to complete the escape, and your adrenaline will rush at certain points! I will not disclose any surprises beyond this.A must do and well worth the money!"
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,40,Such an amazing experience! Every room was so detailed it felt like you were really inside one of the Saw movies! I highly recommend adding this to your list of things to do here in Las Vegas! HANDS DOWN best escape room I've ever been to! 
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,41,The sets were like walking through a movie. Games were unlike any other escape room out there. I love how the story is true from beginning to end. They all really play the part. A+++
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,42,The sets are amazing the gameplay is fun and intuitive. There are props and scenes taken straight from the movies. Each of the rooms has it's own set of challenges. It was an awesome experience I highly recommend it!
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,43,"I've been to many escape rooms and I have never in my life seen anything as detailed and accurate to a movie,  ever! The games were built very smart, not the same boring old (trapped in 1 room for an hour type thing) it had a perfect ratio of scares, brain games and neat technology as well as the biggest creep factor I've ever experienced! Hear Tobin Bell (jigsaw) Himself really put the cherry ontop for me!!! I've also never been to an escape room that has a full retail store as well as a private party room. I will 100% be booking my birthday party here in June! Largest and best escape I've ever played! Bravo!! "
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,44,This place was unreal.  Felt like I was in the movie.  They really need to film the next movie here.   Finally one that doesn't get me bored with the same game as in every other escape room.   It was super long too.  I felt that in a couple rooms that I needed more time because the timers fly by quick.  
"Escape room ""Saw"" by The Official SAW Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-official-saw-escape-room,45,The room with the pods is hard and the first room is as well.
