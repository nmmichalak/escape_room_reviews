One of the best escape rooms I've done. The craftsmanship is incredible in the Saloon room. I cannot wait to return and try out Condemned 2. The staff is also amazing and super friendly. Our whole group couldn't talk about anything but how awesome the room was on the ride home."

The room captivated you and pulled you in the minute you walked in the door. So well built, great attention to detail and we found the treasure with 5 minutes to spare! Whew! I can't wait to go back for Condemned 2!"

This time, coming to the Saloon, I wasn't sure what to expect and it turns out, my roommate and I were the only two who booked for our time slot. We didn't let that stop us! We still had an amazing time and loved all the authentic looking details and intricate clues. We didn't make it but we were close! We'll beat the next one!"

First, the customer service is great. There are plenty of signs to ensure you can find them. Lobby is nice with comfy sofas, soda machine, and restroom. They also provide free lockers so you don't have to leave your purse/items in your vehicle. Our Host was fantastic. The game itself was challenging but fun. Highly recommend!"
