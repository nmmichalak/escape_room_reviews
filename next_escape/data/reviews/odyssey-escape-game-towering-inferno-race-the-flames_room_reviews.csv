"Escape room ""Towering Inferno - Race the Flames"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-towering-inferno-race-the-flames,0,"We had a great time doing this! It was fun to learn so much from Mike about the business and then try our hand at solving the problems (Towering Inferno). The ideas for the rooms were very creative. This was our first time doing an escape room challenge (at least for us 2 older folks), so we were not quite successful, but it was super fun regardless. The challenges were well thought out. The suspenseful music was something I could have lived without, however. ;-)"
"Escape room ""Towering Inferno - Race the Flames"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-towering-inferno-race-the-flames,1,"Yes you read that correctly, this is just like the 1970's movie where you are stuck on a tower that is burning and will crumble if you don't get off the roof in time. (our personal favorite of the four). This escape room has elements that i have never experienced before in a room and a finale that has such a great completion. Just to note there are some dry ice effects in the latter part of the game (and may be able to be disabled upon request). This game would be great for new players and I think there are elements that younger players will appreciate/enjoy a lot. "

And what a fun time it was for the family!! So glad to say that we are ones that Survived the Towering Inferno!! There were 4 in our family along with 4 others. It did get my blood pressure up just a little, but well worth it. Great to know that 4 people that knew each other well could work together with 4 complete strangers to escape!!"
