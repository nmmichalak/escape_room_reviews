"Escape room ""Escape the Midnight Carnival"" by Puzzle Break Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-break-li-escape-the-midnight-carnival,0,"I've done 13 escape rooms before so I was a bit skeptical however Maria was super helpful in helping me figure out a reservation time. We did the Carnival room. Jim was our game master and was fantastic! Super helpful, gave just enough clues to make you feel less incompetent but still didn't give it all away. It was challenging! Although not high tech as I'm used to, it still gave us a run for our money. We escaped with 33 seconds to spare! Would definitely return when on LI."

We did the Carnival room and would definitely give it 5 stars and would absolutely return.This was over the holiday break and the four of them are varied ages (10-21). They were teamed up with a group of 8 who were roughly 12-15 years old. They agreed that all worked together and had fun. Age didn't really make a difference in skill level.The staff was friendly and their facilitator was very personable. At 30 dollars a person I think it is a bit steep, so perhaps there are some discounts for a group."
