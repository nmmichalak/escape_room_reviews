And as Bronze Medals Winners, they plan to come back to reach Gold next time. Thank you for such a wonderful evening."
"Escape room ""Pirate Adventure"" by Escape Room Family in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/escape-room-junior-pirate-adventure,1,We went for my daughterâ€™s 11th birthday. We took 7 kids ages 10-16. They absolutely loved it. The older kids enjoyed it as much as the younger kids. It was mentally challenging and they were physically active as well. The junior concept is much different than the adult escape rooms but I like it better. I highly recommend Escape Room Jr. Thank you for a great time!

We are a family of four. Two adults, a teen, and a preteen. It was challenging and fun for all of us! Was a wonderful way to have the family work together as a team AND you get a little physical activity too!Would highly recommend!"
