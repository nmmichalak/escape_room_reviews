The puzzles were fun, informative, and challenging at the same time! I am looking forward to the next chapter :) Great job guys!"
"Escape room ""LabEscape"" by LabEscape in Champaign-Urbana",https://worldofescapes.com/champaign/quests/labescape-labescape,1,We did this for a Mom’s Night Out! It was so much fun. Great job on the clues and setting up this escape room! Even our “non-science/math” moms had a blast. The staff was so nice! This is a fun experience whether or not you know a lot about science/math. I will definitely go back to take my 13-year-old daughter who loves science and math!

The organizers clearly love physics and sharing it with the world, and a puzzle room is a great way to do that! Thank you for the great experience, I can't wait for the sequel!"
