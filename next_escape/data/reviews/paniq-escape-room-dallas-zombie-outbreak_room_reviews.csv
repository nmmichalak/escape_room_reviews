"Escape room ""Zombie Outbreak"" by PanIQ Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/paniq-escape-room-dallas-zombie-outbreak,0,"So this is my 2nd day in a row to go to this place. Today we did the zombie room. Adrian was very nice, funny, helpful and patient. We enjoyed our time again. This room is a little bit more frustrating trying to figure it out, especially where to even start. I'm just glad the hints are free and unlimited!"

We had so much fun, I highly recommend this place, they don't stack parties together and the guy that was working (Amon, unsure if it is spelled correctly) was very professional and made our experience fun! We will definitely be back."

My family of 4 did the Zombie Outbreak room. The room itself is very fun and realistic, challenges are very challenging yet doable. The game masters were really nice, helpful with hints, and enthusiastic during orientation. We escaped and would go back again!"
