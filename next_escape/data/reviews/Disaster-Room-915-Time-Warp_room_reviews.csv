"Escape room ""Time Warp"" by Disaster Room 915 in El Paso",https://worldofescapes.com/el-paso/quests/Disaster-Room-915-Time-Warp,3,"Thus far I've done two rooms, Escape from Aliens and the Haunted Heidi. We have adored both escape situations. Thematically the details are excellent. I won't go into details to divulge the secrets, very well done thematically. Very challenging and it definitely gets those gears working in your mind. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who loves puzzles, strategic gaming of any sort. Go in with a group that you're comfortable with as it can be high stress and you're under an exceptionally tight deadline. Cannot wait to try the new scenarios as they come out."
