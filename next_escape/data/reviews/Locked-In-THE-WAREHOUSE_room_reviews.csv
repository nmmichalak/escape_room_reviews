"Escape room ""The Warehouse"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-WAREHOUSE,0,"It was a lot of fun. We did the Warehouse. We didn't escape, though. We had one more clue to unlock to get there. Only complaint would be getting joined with people we didn't know. I understand that is part of the drawback when having a small group, but it does make the experience a little less enjoyable. Other than that, we had a great time and plan to play more in the future."
"Escape room ""The Warehouse"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-WAREHOUSE,1,We loved it! The warehouse was so much fun. My 15-year-old son was under the impression he was not going to have fun. But he hated to admit he had a blast with his mom and dad here. Such an awesome place! We highly recommend coming here.

It was a wonderful experience. Although it was just the two of us that booked that time, we made it out with only 4 minutes left. I recommend everyone (all ages) go and experience being Locked In & ESCAPE!"
