"Escape room ""Space War"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-space-wars,0,"First time here at Quest Factor after my rigorous evening workout and volunteering in Seattle. My quest master, Brendon, gave us a fantastic rundown and support during the escape room. My group ended up escaping, of course, because we are a group of intellects, except for our colleague Mary, who only held us back. Nonetheless, it was a perfect experience and would recommend to one of my many friends!"
"Escape room ""Space War"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-space-wars,1,"It was my first experience with escape rooms, and it was truly memorable! It started with professional, and attentive staff that helped our group throughout the quest room. We've hit a few dead ends and stalled in the room, but our game master was able to help us to navigate, and pushed us towards the right direction without giving away the puzzle. We did not solve it on time since it was a difficult room. However, the experience was great and we're looking forward to return, finish the room we started, and try a few more! I definitely recommend!"
