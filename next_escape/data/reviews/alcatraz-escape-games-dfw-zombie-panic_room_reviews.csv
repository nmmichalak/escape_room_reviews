"Escape room ""Zombie Panic"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-dfw-zombie-panic,0,"We did the horcrux and the zombie rooms - they were AWESOME! The rooms were done well and the puzzles made sense and worked well with the themes. Everyone running the rooms was friendly and gave good clues.A note about the zombie one: if you’re a scaredy cat like me, but like to be scared - this one is for you! It was a “jumpy” and suspenseful kind of scariness - which I liked! It was not gory or too gruesome.There’s one room left for us to do, but I hope they’re able to add more rooms later, as I really enjoyed what they’ve done!"
