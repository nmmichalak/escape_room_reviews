"Escape room ""Detective Story"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-detective-story,0,"Staff very enthusiastic about escape games and very professional. I highly recommend this company for the staff and design of their rooms. Detective Story was a nicely themed room. I felt like I was in a mob bosses office. Easy to med. difficulty. Four of us escaped in 40 min. If your team is up for a slightly harder room, I would recommend John Doe over the Detective Story room. See my review on that room. "
"Escape room ""Detective Story"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-detective-story,1,My three chums and I had a fun hour and the game masters were super polite. The 70's detective room is nothing outstanding but it is a thoroughly executed design. Challenging puzzle but (fortunately for our egos) we solved it and did not lean on hints. Yay team! Glad to hear they are adding two more rooms soon. Really good bonding experience.

The games were challenging but fun. We did the detective one and we called 3 times for a clue but the helpers didnt mind. Overall a great experience and the staff were very enthusiastic and fun.

"Escape room ""Detective Story"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-detective-story,4,"Great experience. We did the Detective themed game. The challenge and puzzles were very deep and complicated. My wife and I and our 3 kids (18, 17, 11) solved it with 6 minutes left and using 2 clues. We still felt lost at the halfway point but started putting things together soon after. But even when you start to get going, there is still so much to solve. We loved the whole experience. Friendly staff, great challenge story, clean and crisp all around. If you're considering doing this, I encourage you to go for it. So much fun."

If you're looking for a great time with friends in the City, you should absolutely give this a try. I can't wait to go back and do the next escape room. Staff was super friendly and helpful."

Awesome experience, we can't wait to go back for another mystery. This is not an easy case to solve, we definitely had to work together to figure it out. So much fun! Do it!"
