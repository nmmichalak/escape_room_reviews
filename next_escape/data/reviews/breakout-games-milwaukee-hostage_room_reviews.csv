"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-hostage,0,I had been to a few escape rooms before but my husband and friends had not.We decided tonight was the night.Searched online and found these guys.Excellent experience.We did the Hostage room. We made it out in time.I have only one thing I didn't care for but understand is that the walls are thin. So we could hear other rooms and at times it was difficult to hear our game master due to the noise (happy excited patrons) in the hall. But I understand. I was probably noisy too not realizing the effect I was having on someone else's experience. Can't make that a negative if the patrons are happy and excited to be there.The employees were all friendly and kind. We will return. I hope you give it a shot!
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-hostage,1,This is a great room to do if you have never done one or if you have a small group. The staff is great and will direct you to the best game for your group.
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-hostage,2,"We do a LOT of escape rooms and we were very pleasantly surprised with our experience at Breakout. We had heard these rooms were a bit easier than other Escape Room venues in the area, so we picked a tougher one here. In this room you are handcuffed and blindfolded to begin, so if that freaks you out, skip this one. If it doesn't freak you out, then go for it!This room was on the small side, but a LOT was crammed into it. We just happened to cruise through this room. Things clicked for us - not in an 'wow this is super easy' way, but a way in which we just figured stuff out in a logical, satisfying, WOW, way. I swear we were on track to break a record - even the game master told us that during the game. Then we hit a snag that cost us 15 freaking minutes. We refused a clue because we didn't want to be bailed out. In hindsight, we should have just taken the clue. haha.Anyway, we DID escape in about 45 minutes even losing the 15 minutes, but it wasn't because the room was easy, it was just a room we all happened to 'get'. Aside from that one stumper (which was SO clear once we figured it out finally), the flow was fantastic and the story really good."

After you're handcuffed you have to figure out a series of linear puzzles to find out who hijacked the plan and how to get out of the room In under 60 mins. This is a highly fun date night, alternative to going to the movies, or even just for the heck of it. Our group consist of only 2 people, but great for groups."

Absolutely loved the ""hostage"" situation we were put in, and we were laughing the whole time while also working together to escape within an hour! James was an EXCELLENT game keeper, we can't speak highly enough of him making us feel comfortable. Can't wait to return for another situation!"
