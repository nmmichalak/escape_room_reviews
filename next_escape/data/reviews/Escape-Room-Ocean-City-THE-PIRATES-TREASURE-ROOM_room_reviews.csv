My husband and I did the Pirate room at the Uptown location and it was a lot of fun! However, even though it was just the two of us, we got out in less than 30 minutes. The staff mentioned the Sherlock room is harder, maybe we’ll try that next time. Probably a great starter room but didn’t exactly feel like we got our money’s worth."
