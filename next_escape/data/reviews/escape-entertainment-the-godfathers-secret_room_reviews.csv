Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-entertainment-the-godfathers-secret,0,"Four of us attempted Godfathers Secret escape room this week at E 12928 Indiana location. Luke, our host, was very pleasant and entertaining. It definitely was challenging and fun looking for clues. No, we didn't make it out in the 60 minutes, but we enjoyed our time trying to make our escape."
