"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-antidote,0,"What a great place! Fantastic steampunk decor. We started with lunch and the menu is simple but good. Service was attentive and friendly. Our games host was lovely, friendly and fun. We did the “Antidote” game, which was challenging but not exasperating or impossible. There were six of us, ages ranging from 15 to 50.All in all a really fun afternoon, we had a great time, I would highly recommend it and I can’t wait to return next time we are in Denver."

The experience was amazing. The staff are very friendly and the game master Devon was hilarious. We played Antidote, and the game was exciting and challenging. Afterward, we grabbed a drink themed to the game we played and grabbed a bite. Their drinks are fun and food is delicious! We will definitely be back soon."

The puzzles and riddles in the room were unique compared to a lot of other rooms we've done. Plus, we had drinks before which were also awesome (not to mention the GORGEOUS steampunk decor). I mean, who can say no to a cocktail with tequila and prosecco? We will definitely be back - this is a must for escape room addicts!!"
