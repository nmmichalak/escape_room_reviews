"Escape room ""Skip Tracer"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-skip-tracer,0,"My wife and I are escape room addicts, and when we found ourselves with a day to kill in the central valley, we decided to find an escape room. We ended up playing Skip Tracer and Family Jewels here at Mind Games Clovis. Both games were well thought out, and we especially enjoyed Skip Tracer's clever hind-delivery system. With only two people, Skip Tracer was challenging, but we made it out with several minutes to spare. Family Jewels was easier, but there was still plenty to find and explore. Our hostess was very pleasant, and we could tell she really enjoys what she does."
"Escape room ""Skip Tracer"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-skip-tracer,1,So much fun! A group of us friends got together and did the detective room. It was the right amount of challenging and such a great concept. We can't wait to try another room. Staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend!
