"Escape room ""Escape The Pharaoh's Tomb"" by Locked Up Escape Games in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/locked-up-escape-games-escape-the-pharaohs-tomb,0,"My group did Pharoah's Tomb last night. It was absolutely awesome!! Very fun and challenging. What sets this apart from other ""locked up"" venues is that there are multiple rooms, not just puzzles to solve. The hour flew by. We solved it with 30 seconds to spare. Mikayla, who welcomed us was outstanding. You can tell she loves what she does! She was friendly and funny. Will definitely be back to do the other rooms. Great way to spend my daughter's birthday! Well done!"
"Escape room ""Escape The Pharaoh's Tomb"" by Locked Up Escape Games in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/locked-up-escape-games-escape-the-pharaohs-tomb,1,"We just did the Pharaohs Tomb! Very different than other escape experiences we've had. Secret passages, mummies, tricked out puzzles with panels that open when you solve the puzzle. I loved the way they threw multiple puzzles at you at once and you had to sort it out.If you are trying to think of something different to do, I highly recommend this."
