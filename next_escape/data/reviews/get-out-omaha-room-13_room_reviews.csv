"Escape room ""Room 13"" by Get Out: Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/get-out-omaha-room-13,0,We did Room 13 last night. If we had 15 more seconds we would have punched in the final code and been out! This was the third escape room that I've done and by far the most challenging one. Very in-depth and creative on multiple levels. I would highly recommend it! Hoping to try Y2K sometime and escape!
