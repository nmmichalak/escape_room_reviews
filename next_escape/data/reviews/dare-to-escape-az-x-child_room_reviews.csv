"Escape room ""X-Child"" by Dare To Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dare-to-escape-az-x-child,0,"We've done a lot of escape rooms around the valley, but Dare to Escape's rooms are by far the best! Cult of Mithras and X-Child (which we broke the records on!) utilized the most creative puzzles, riddles, and devices that our group has encountered in AZ. Some of the secrets in the rooms actually left us with a sense of awe and wonder! I'd say the rooms strike the perfect balance between making you think outside the box and communicate with your team while avoiding frustrating, ridiculously-hard and obscure problems that are impossible to solve. Loved the themes of the rooms as well and can't wait to return for The Cell! These are the best escape rooms in AZ that we've encountered and I would definitely recommend them to anyone!"

We had such a great time we came back later that night. And then booked the third room two days later. Recommend starting with Mithras and then X Child. Haven't done the cell yet. That's tomorrow!! Nice to talk to one of the owners -- local boys and their own ideas. Love that!! Great customer service and fantastic experience."
"Escape room ""X-Child"" by Dare To Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dare-to-escape-az-x-child,2,My friends and I have done many escape rooms around the valley and the x-child room is definitely one of my favorites! It was so much fun! Definitely requires a lot of communication between group members which is part of the reason I liked it so much. We'll definitely be coming back to check out the other room(s).
