"Escape room ""Vet Office"" by Fuzzy Logic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fuzzy-logic-escape-room-vet-office,2,"Fun for a group of teenagers. It's very challenging and they used all the given clues, but had a great time figuring it out together. I like that there were two separate rooms in the ""Vet Room"", so you could complete one room then move on to the other. The person there was very helpful and friendly. Would definitely go back there again."
