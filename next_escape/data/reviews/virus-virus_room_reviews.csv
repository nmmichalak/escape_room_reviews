"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,0,"The production value in this spot was amazing! Definitely a challenging room, but having the actor in the space was great to keep us on point, without giving hints away. The VR experience was the first I had tried as well, and it really helped to add to the whole room."
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,1,Absolutely the coolest room I've ever done. LOVE THE OCULUS RIFT INTRO. Completely immersive. Felt like I was really a scientist out to save the world.....and my own life.We need more rooms as awesome as this one! Looking forward to the next one!
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,2,"I've done a few escape room experiences, and this is BY FAR the best!  Well thought-out, clever puzzles, and great effects!  Not really a beginner's escape room... I recommend you try a few others around town and save the best (this one) for a very special occasion.  We did not make it out...but totally loved the whole experience from the moment we arrived until we left.  We had 6 of us. I wouldn't do it with less because there are so many tasks to complete."
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,3,"WOW SERIOUSLY ONE OF THE BEST ROOMS, EVER! I can't wait for their upcoming submarine room. I would recommend booking max capacity since you'll be needing all the help. Our experience from beginning to end was fantastic. The production value, entertainment, puzzles, technology, and experience were all top-notch. It really doesn't get better than this. I cannot recommend The Virus enough."
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,4,"From start to finish, this was an amazing experience.Once your group is together, you're no longer customers, you're ""doctors,"" brought together to save the world from virus that's destroying the planet. The whole experience reinforces that-- the VR presentation does a wonderful job of making you feel like you're entering a secret government lab, deep in the bowels of the earth. The room itself was expertly decorated, and while you recognized that this wasn't *really* a multi-million dollar lab, it also didn't feel like something that was thrown together in a weekend to cash in on the escape room craze..."
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virus-virus,5,One freaking puzzle away! What an amazing time we had! It was soooo challenging and the puzzles were very thought out! Go do it!
