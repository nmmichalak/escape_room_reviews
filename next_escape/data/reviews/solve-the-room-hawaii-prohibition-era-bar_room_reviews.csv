"Escape room ""Prohibition Era Bar"" by Solve the Room Hawaii in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/solve-the-room-hawaii-prohibition-era-bar,0,"Our favorite of the three. The theming was great. We really felt like we were in a bar. The puzzles were well designed. There was enough to do with our group size of five. We have done over 50 rooms and this room still had some puzzle that made us work, think, and wrack our brains for the solution! That is the mark of a nicely designed escape room! Great for 4-6 players. On the down side, the hint system used a tablet for receiving texts. Players should have their hands free. There are little red stickers on items “not to be interacted with.” -- mostly items on the walls. This just takes away from the immersion experience and these items should be propery secured in place. This is lazy room construction. I hope the company fixes these issues for their new rooms."
