"Escape room ""Super Powers"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-super-powers,0,We were looking for something to do with teens ranging from 12-18 for one night in Denver. The Epic Escape Game was the perfect solution. Stephen was a great game master and the puzzle was great fun. Thanks for a great night without kids focused on electronic devices

Last few times we've been in town visiting, the whole family will do an escape room and this place is exceptional. Great staff and great games! Highly recommended."

I have now done two of their rooms, and they are a good level of difficulty, with plenty of fun puzzles.  The production value isn't the highest (I have been to others that seem like they could be a real apartment that someone lives in), but I would much rather have high quality puzzles, and that is the case here.  We are going to keep heading back until we have done them all!"
