Excellent for both those looking to try their first escape room, as well as for addicts like us who are looking for something fun and new. We visited 3 different southern Florida escape room locations today and this was the highlight. We played all 3 rooms, and particularly enjoyed the 18+ ""Bad Girl"" room- would be a blast for a guys or girls night out paired with alcohol and Uber. Kudos to the owners to creating something really clever, unique, intuitive, and fun."
