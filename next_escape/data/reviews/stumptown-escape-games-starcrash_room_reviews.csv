"Escape room ""StarCrash"" by Stumptown Escape Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/stumptown-escape-games-starcrash,0,"Absolutely fabulous.The family owned & operated business is genuinely interested in providing an amazing experience for you and your group. My friends and I came on a Saturday night as a group of four to complete the Starcrash room... it was tough and we almost made it out, but the fact that we didn't escape and came back the following weekend (with reinforcements) says enough. The game-masters balance the fine line of supporting your game play with just enough tips and commentary (& some sassy remarks were the perfect fit for our group) without ruining the puzzle aspect of the room. We'll definitely be back again! Especially when they finish building this fourth room!!"

Went with a group of friends and family and tried the StarCrash room. We didn't quite escape, but were very close! Loved the room design, the puzzles were very well done, and the interactive ""computer"" was both funny and helpful. Our GameMaster, Matt, was personable and super competent, as well as fun! Can't wait to go back and try another room!"
