"Escape room ""Quarantine"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-quarantine,0,"We took on the Quarantine challenge. Skylar was our guide for this room, and the clues that we needed were timely and helpful without making the room any easier. We escaped, and that was super exciting due to the degree of difficulty this room presents to its players. There were some really unique puzzles in this room - certainly well thought out in concept and design. And this room is actually duplicated, so if you bring a larger group you can both do this room and complete against each other, as well as the clock."

Quarantine was probably my favorite room so far, even though it was definitely the hardest. The variety of puzzles was great, and it really gave people the opportunity to work on several things at the same time."
