"Escape room ""Nevermore"" by Paradox Point in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/paradox-point-nevermore,3,This was our first escape room experience and it was great! We did the Nevermore (Edgar allen Poe) room. The clues and puzzles were tricky enough to keep it very interesting. We all had a blast and we all worked together well! Loved it. We will be back for the other room soon!

I took my bridal party and we all had a great time, we couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had. The Nevermore room was perfect, it strained our brain, but still simple enough to enjoy and progress forward. Staff was friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend Paradox Point and will definitely be returning for more fun in the future."

Personally, Nevermore wasn't challenging enough for our group, but we do a lot of escape rooms. I also felt like sometimes the guides gave too many hints when we didn't ask specifically for a clue. Overall, a good time. It's an excellent first escape room if you have never tried one and would be perfect if you have any young ones with you also!"
