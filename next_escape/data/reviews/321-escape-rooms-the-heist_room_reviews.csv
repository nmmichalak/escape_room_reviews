I enjoyed both, but The Heist is by far the best escape room I've done, it was challenging, but not impossible. Also, the decor is awesome and all of the details fit with the theme so well, even if you can't escape, you'll have a pretty cool view for an hour!"

We did ""The Heist"" room. The room looked very nice the whole concept of the story was laid out wonderfully. Christine was very helpful in getting us on track when we needed it.
