"Escape room ""Hopper's Cabin"" by Escape Woods in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-woods-hoppers-cabin,0,Had my daughters 12th birthday party at Hoppers Cabin. It was so much fun! The girls loved it and it was so nicely done and authentic. The staff is absolutely amazing!!!! We will definitely visit again!

We did Hopper's cabin fir the Stranger Things fans out there. They gave us special directions to get to the location which was pretty easy to find. Our game master met us about 15 minutes before our start time. It was a short dark walk to the cabin.  He gave us the instructions inside because it was very cold out. Once we got inside it reminded me of Stranger Things, and it was pretty awesome. The room was freezing but they did have a small heater.We were able to take pics he just asked us not to take pics of the clues, which is completely understandable. We had an hour to complete our task which were were able to. There were 9 ppl in our party.So leaving the venue was difficult probably because it was night time and I believe he said it was a sixty acre farm. Either way he saw us struggling so he called and guided us out."

The Christmas Tree  part of the farm was in full swing so we maneuvered around all that traffic and were directed to Hopper's Cabin parking.  We were met and led back to the cabin and the two who had watched Stranger Things were excited!  We were glad they watched in order to complete the last section in the cabin.  Very cool escape game.  We are going to come back and do others!  On the way out looks like they have a petting zoo?!  We were oohing and ahhing over the baby goats.  Now I know where to get pumpkins and Christmas Trees.
