"Escape room ""The Woods"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-the-woods,0,"Today I almost came in with a friend to see if I could do a room. Unfortunately right before I parked, I drove by and heard a few managers or owners yelling at their employee. This poor person was getting yelled at while looking completely miserable. I will NEVER book a game here and suggest people don't either. I would NEVER pay a buisiness that treats their staff like animals. Please never come here and I will recommend that people DON'T come here. Very disgusting to see that people are treated like that."
"Escape room ""The Woods"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-the-woods,1,"A group of friends and I visited A Narrow Escape and did “The Woods” Room. We had a great time at this new venue.The highlight of the trip wasn’t the room, but the fantastic team behind the rooms that we all got to meet. The passion that this family has put into their business is evident throughout their gorgeous scenery in-room, their commitment to keeping their puzzles themed and not just a series of numbers and locks, and their genuine interest in feedback and desire to provide an excellent experience.We were three escape room veterans and three new escapists. My crew has escaped from some pretty tough rooms in the Orlando area, all billed as the “hardest” room at their respective venues, with 10% or lower advertised escape rates. I have to say the Woods was the most challenging Room we ever encountered, by a long shot. I’m not sure how the other rooms at Narrow Escape compare to this one, but definitely go prepared for a tough challenge.I can’t say enough good things about the people behind A Narrow Escape, all of whom worked hard throughout our escape to make sure we had a good time, and ask for genuine feedback. Top notch customer service, and some of the best scenic work I’ve seen. Check them out!"

It was a very fun and challenging escape room! The staff and owners were able to give us just enough information and backstory beforehand to figure out how to escape. Very fun!

Challenging rooms with interesting puzzles. We did Toxicity and the Woods, we will be back to do Lycan very soon. I highly recommended this local business!"
