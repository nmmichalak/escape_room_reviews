"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-special-ops-mysterious-market,0,We traveled to NYC for a family trip with a 10 and 11 year old .We decided to try our attempt in the escape room which at first seemed to be a daunting task but kids were up for it. The staff explained the room and game rules so our kids understood everything. The task were difficult but with a kids perspective we were able to escape the special OPS room and use our 3 hints.

We especially liked Playground and Special Ops. Special Ops in particular has a lot unique technology built in, and Playground is one of the most collaborative we've had to be in any escape room. All the rooms and props are some of the most immersive I've seen. We will definitely be back to try another room of theirs!"

Most escape rooms don’t like/accept walk ins, but they were very accommodating for our group of 6! We did the Special Ops room, which was pretty difficult, but our game guide helped us out the whole way! Some of the tricks really make you think, but it’s a good room for 4-6 experienced escape room goers.My only regret is that I forgot her name!! (Jamie maybe?) The game was at 2:30 10/6/19."
