"Escape room ""Bates Motel"" by Gulf Coast Escape Room in Destin",https://worldofescapes.com/destin/quests/gulf-coast-escape-room-destin-bates-motel,1,Me and my friends did it today and it was a blast. We worked hard as a team but threw some insults at one another. We survived with 16 seconds left of the clock for the Bates Motel. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants have fun and feel like their in a horror movie. I'm most definitely going to go back to try all the other rooms they have available to see if we can clutch those the way we did with Bates Motel.
