We did the Heist game and felt like I was in a video game with the challenging puzzles plus my group from my job was entertaining so it all worked out. PLUS, we escaped!"

Never mind that the escape room itself was exceptional (we escaped from ""The Heist""). When they found out it was my birthday, after we got out of the room, I was presented with a birthday card that had personalized messages from everyone on staff! Everyone made sure we had a great experience. I will definitely be coming back!"

The clues found were very unique. Fortunately, I was with a group of ""seasoned escapees"" who were familiar with the ways of Escape Rooms. We did 2 rooms. The Heist defeated us. UGH!!! It was a real challenge. Looking forward to more escapes."

We were 4 people when it was meant for 8, but they let us do it on our own. The employees were very accommodating and nice, and the game was incredibly fun. We would have escaped given literally a few more seconds, but it was a challenge. I highly recommend this place and will go back next time I am in Dallas to try another situation."
