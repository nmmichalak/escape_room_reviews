Owner delightful and helpful. You need more than 2 people to do this in an hour, but definitely worth it. The Double Agent puzzle is a more cerebral than just a clue hunt."

Very entertaining (not to mention challenging). No we did not succeed (the only downside is we ended up an ""almost"") but we our mission was accomplished. We had ten A personalities in a room with no fatalities and in fact had a lot of fun. And we laughed. And we all worked together as a team and team building was indeed our mission.Can't wait to try another room. Highly recommend for all ages."
