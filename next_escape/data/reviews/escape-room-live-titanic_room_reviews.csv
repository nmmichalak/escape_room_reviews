I loved the ambiance and the decor, very classy. We were in the titanic room, very challenging. We didn't make it out in time, but we were able to find all the clues with help. Staff were very friendly and answered all our questions. Loved the photo op and debrief after. Loved my first escape room experience and my sister and friends had a great time."

We could not have been happier from start to finish! The staff was welcoming to all - and the facility was spacious and beautiful. The girls remained excited and engaged throughout their ""voyage"" - and were quite challenged by the experience. My husband and I were able to relax with a beverage in the lounge while the girls tried to escape; it was a fabulous experience for all!"
