We did the Pandemic room and it was pretty challenging. There was not a lot of room for error, but our game master Blake was really awesome and helped us out. Definitely will come back!"
"Escape room ""Pandemic"" by America's Escape Game in Oxford (MS)",https://worldofescapes.com/oxford-ms/quests/americas-escape-game-oxford-pandemic,1,Had a wonderful time. Did the Pandemic scenario and is was really fun even with not finishing. Can't wait to try again. I recommend everyone go try it at least once. You'll be hooked after.
