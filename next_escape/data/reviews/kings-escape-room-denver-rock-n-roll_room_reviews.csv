You utilize record players (!!!! Which our game master said they had to explain to people how to use), hampers, beer bottles etc. our group of two got out with 3 min to spare."

Our group of 7 did the Rock n Roll room and had so much fun! The room was pretty challenging but we ended up finishing with 3 minutes to spare. Really creative! The owner, Steve, is also hilarious and makes the experience even more fun. Highly recommend going!"

We did the Rock and Roll Room and had an absolute blast. i have done around 40 escape rooms and I can attest that this one is definitely up there among the top rooms I've done. The decor is on point and the puzzles follow the theme, something that I prefer when doing an escape room because I like how it allows the game to be a totally immersive experience. The owner was extremely personable and was definitely helpful when we needed a couple clues. Overall, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!"

We did the rock and roll room and had a blast trying to figure out way out! The owners did such a great job with the rooms (the decor, the clues, everything) and we can't wait to come back and do another."

We chose the Rock and Roll room mainly because the theme was so inviting. When we stepped into the room, we really felt like we were transported into the 70's and in a swanky hotel. The puzzles and games to play were well thought out, challenging and very playable. I won't give too much away, but you better know your music as one of the puzzles tests your ability to listen to music carefully. Such a creative aspect to the room! The owner was very friendly and very hospitable. Wishing great success with Kings!!"
