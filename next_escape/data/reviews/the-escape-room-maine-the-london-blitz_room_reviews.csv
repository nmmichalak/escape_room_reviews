"Escape room ""The London Blitz"" by The Escape Room in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/the-escape-room-maine-the-london-blitz,0,We had a great time completing the London Blitz room!
"Escape room ""The London Blitz"" by The Escape Room in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/the-escape-room-maine-the-london-blitz,1,I booked The London Blitz room for my husbandâ€™s birthday today. It was so easy to book a group of six people and have the rest of the room blocked off so we could play on our own. The room was superbly decorated and it was so much fun to complete all of the puzzles. You can tell everyone who works there loves what they are doing and it was an amazing time all around. The room was just challenging enough without feeling too easy or too hard. The Escape Room was a fantastic treat and we are already planning our next time back!

The staff were extremely nice and helpful. The London room was challenging but doable. We got out with 13 minutes left. We will be going back to try another room.

Me and 3 friends went into The Blitz and escaped with about 6 minutes to spare. The puzzles were definitely brain strenuous, but very solvable! It was such a great experience and the staff was wonderful!"
