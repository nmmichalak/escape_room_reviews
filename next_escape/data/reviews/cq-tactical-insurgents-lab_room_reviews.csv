"Escape room ""Insurgent's Lab"" by CQ Tactical in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/cq-tactical-insurgents-lab,0,"This business is NOT family friendly. After booking a child's birthday party and being told that our children will play against another child's birthday party,we were shocked when our children (9 children all under age 9) were lined up to play against a team of 12 adults. Jeff, the manager, excused this as not having booked exclusive and claimed his staff has a memorized script for booking parties so that this can be explained to persons. But he could not provide the script. Two children were hurt in the games. Several children cried. They lost all except the last game. This is NOT what you want for your child on his/her birthday. If you want family-friendly laser tag, go to the Ice Sports Forum instead."
