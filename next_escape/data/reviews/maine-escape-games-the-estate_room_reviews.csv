"Escape room ""The Estate"" by Maine Escape Games in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/maine-escape-games-the-estate,0,"Took my twelve-year-old son, his friend and my 14-year-old daughter. We did the Estate... it was so clever! Staff was so accommodating and helpful. Was fun to see the kids working so well together. We will definitely be back!"

It was awesome! The room accommodates up to 6 people, we only had 4 and it was plenty. It was challenging, but in a way where you become almost addicted to solving the next portion of the puzzle. It's frustrating but not discouraging. Almost all of the solutions require logic, some a bit of math and some a bit of mechanical understanding. As such, this place will appeal to folks from a wide variety of backgrounds and skill levels. The staff was fun and friendly and while this was my first escape room experience, it will definitely not be my last. I'm hooked!"

We took my two teenage nephews and they loved it. We did ""The Estate"" room and the room itself, clues and challenges were amazing. Would highly recommend."

Our teenage sons had a blast and my husband couldn't get over how great this experience was. I've been to two other locations before and Maine Escape Games was by far my favorite. Extremely well-done game. We will go again for sure. Highly recommended location for group fun!"

We went with friends for one of their birthdays. Everyone had a great time. The staff was amazing... Helpful, friendly etc! The room was great. Everyone aided the group in some way and all felt that it was some of the best money we ever spent. The only warning I have is: If you do this once you will probably be like us and want to go again! We will all be sharing the word about how great this place is!"
