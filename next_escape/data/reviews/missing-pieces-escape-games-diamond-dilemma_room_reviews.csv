The staff was gracious enough to accommodate us at the last minute. This was not the first escape room for our group of 6, but we still found it pretty challenging! We did escape with 22 whole seconds to spare! The facilities, parking and staff were stellar. Definitely looking forward to going back when they have their next puzzle room up and running!"

They LOVED the experience! They solved the Diamond Dilemma in 45 minutes, which I understand is good for newbies. It was very appropriate for them and the want to return to do the other adventure. Lots of fun and so fun for me to watch them all use their various talents and work together to figure out all of the clues."
