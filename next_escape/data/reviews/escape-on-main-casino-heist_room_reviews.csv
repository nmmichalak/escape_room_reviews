"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by Escape on Main in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-on-main-casino-heist,1,The Casino Heist was such a fun and unique experience with my kids. And the customer service is the best around!! We can't wait to go back to solve the Baker Street Mystery. Glad to hear they are expanding and we are looking forward to trying out the Pirate ship escape when that is up and running. This place will do great!
"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by Escape on Main in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-on-main-casino-heist,2,"My daughter wanted to have some friends and try out the escape room. So for her 12th birthday, my husband took her and 6 other 12 year olds and they did the casino heist. From the time of booking, all the way until the end, everyone was exceptional. The kids (and my husband and I) had a blast and they were able to escape with only seconds remaining. Molly was fantastic with the clues! Highly recommended and we can't wait to do the other room. Thanks again for everything!"
