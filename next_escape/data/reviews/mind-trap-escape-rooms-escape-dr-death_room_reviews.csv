"Escape room ""Doctor Death"" by Mind Trap Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mind-trap-escape-rooms-escape-dr-death,0,"We (barely) escaped Dr. Death, and we can't wait to go back for more!  This escape room stands out among competitors due to its complex layout, incorporation of technology, originality, and cleverness.  Several times, I thought to myself, ""Did they just do that?!""  Then, ""How did they do that?!""  And finally, ""When can I come back?!"""

We made it out with 3 minutes left. We did Dr Death and the room was scary, huge and fun! They put a lot of detail into the room and clues. It was totally amazing time and we would did another room again. The owner was friendly and helpful too."
"Escape room ""Doctor Death"" by Mind Trap Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mind-trap-escape-rooms-escape-dr-death,2,"I came here for a bachelor party, and my group wouldn't stop talking about how much fun they had. Ryan worked with our party to make sure we had a great time, and was very accommodating. We did the Doctor Death escape room, and it was the perfect amount of scare and complexity. I have done several escape rooms, and this one by far was the best one I've done. The attention to detail of the ""set"" was perfect, and the puzzles were complex, but not ridiculous. We also did laser tag here, which was a blast as well. You cannot go wrong here, truly a gem in the area."
