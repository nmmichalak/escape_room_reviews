Escape from the Machine is my all time favorite puzzle room since I did it in 2015! Mission to Planet X definitely blew my mind as well! Between the amazing decor, well thought out puzzles, and the friendly staff and owners they are a well rounded 5 star experience. Everyone needs to check them out! Can't wait for the new summer/fall adventure I hear might be coming:-)"

Our 6th, his 1st. We really enjoyed the room and the technicians were very helpful. The only down side to it was that the alligator clips were very small and difficult to use. Overall, a great adventure."
