"Escape room ""Chemical Lab"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-chemical-lab,0,Probably the hardest of the Lock Down rooms as of Nov. 2018. My wife and I have done 50+ rooms and solved this room with only 2 minutes to spare. Better played with 3-5 players. The immersion was realistic. Perfect mix of modern and unique traditional elements nicely themed. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and polite. They were very accommodating with the booking process. The game master was tracking our progress carefully and gave hints promptly. Can’t say enough about this company and their rooms!
