"Escape room ""Pharaoh’s Curse"" by Escape Room Zone in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-zone-pharaohs-curse,0,We had a great time - the new Pharaoh room was extremely hard but well thought out and decorations and props were nicely done. There was a lot to do - we could have used more people. We also did the Bank Heist last year - a fun place for families.
"Escape room ""Pharaoh’s Curse"" by Escape Room Zone in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-zone-pharaohs-curse,1,"My group of six completed The Pharaoh's Curse and it was challenging and fun at the same time. Since it was our first time, we were told that this would be pretty difficult. We escaped in an hour and twelve minutes using five hints. I definitely would recommend this challenge to newcomers and experienced escape room enthusiasts."
