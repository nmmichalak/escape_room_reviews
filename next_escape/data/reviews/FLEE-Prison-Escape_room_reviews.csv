"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Prison-Escape,0,This was a perfect family activity for our son's 14th birthday. We did the prison break...it was challenging and fun! We appreciated a few hints and encouragement from our guide. We can't wait to do the Museum Heist. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Prison-Escape,1,"We had 8 people playing the Prison Break last night which was a bit too many (4 - 6 might be perfect). Nevertheless, it was an incredible compelling experience. Clever puzzles, amazing scene settings. Everything feels so real. Makes me thinking about the solutions even when I'm not playing it. Absolutely loved it!"
"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Prison-Escape,2,We did a test run last week. This is my first time playing a real life escape game and the experience is amazing. It is definitely not a hardcore gamer only experience! People with not much experience and skills could still offer lots of help in solving the room. We had so much fun and it definitely feels achieved to be able to finish the test run in time!
"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Prison-Escape,3,"I tried out one of their theme rooms, called ""Prison Room"". It's one of the best escape room I have tried. I will try to give a detailed review without giving out any spoiler here. I like the theme decorations and design of the puzzles. All of the puzzles can be solved through logic and the clues given in the room, in a way that I don't feel frustrated while trying to solve the puzzles. The puzzles are also very well connected to the main story theme. One plus thing is that the staffs are very nice and my whole group was very well taken care of. I highly recommend this place if you want a brain workout! Can't wait to try out other rooms they have!"
"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Prison-Escape,4,"FLEE offers unique experience as there are 5 different rooms all with different themes and story-lines. Rooms are designed for relative small groups (4-7 people). The puzzles are not too hard for beginners, but in-depth enough to keep pros busy."
