"Escape room ""Clue Dunnit?"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-clue-dunnit,0,Really great experience. The room was challenging and very well thought out. The host was fun and added to the experience. I highly recommend this adventure.

A couple of our group had previously done an escape room, so we did an intermediate level room. Bad idea! We used all of our clues plus some! The staff member was very nice and accommodating, though and we did solve it with seconds to spare. This being my first one, I have nothing to compare it to, but the 2 that had done it before said this one was harder but still fun. It definitely put our problem solving and puzzle skills to the test!"
