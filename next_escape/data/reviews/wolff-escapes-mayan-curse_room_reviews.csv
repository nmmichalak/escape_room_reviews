The Mayan room was prefaced with an interesting story, the clues were very creatively implemented with some high-tech electronic effects, and the owner is very friendly and welcomes feedback for continuous improvement. I would recommend Wolff Escape Rooms to anyone! Definitely coming back when the new rooms are open!"
