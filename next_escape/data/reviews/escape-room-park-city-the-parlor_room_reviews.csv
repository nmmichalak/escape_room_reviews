"Escape room ""The Parlor"" by Escape Room Park City in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/escape-room-park-city-the-parlor,0,"My wife and kids and I visited for the second time, having done The Mine last year. We have done Rooms in TX, AR, and MO and this is by far our favorite. This time our ages ranged from my ten year old son to my 70 year old parents. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. The attention to detail is first rate and the staff is terrific. The parlor was terrific and very challengingâ€”great for the more experienced. If you are not sure which one, I would recommend their signature room, The Mine. Not only is it well designed it gives you a very reminiscent feel for the old culture of Park City."

WHAT A BLAST!!! The team came together and worked well. We did the murder mystery room, and it was very challenging, yet within reach working fast over one hour. The creators did an awesome job- I have participated in other escape rooms, and this one exceeded my expectations. Very creative plot and room dynamics. Nice work. I recommend."

As it turned out, our 3 adult children were really great working together to uncover and solve clues. The hour flew bye, and we escaped with seconds to spare. This was a great family activity. The escape room is ingenious! Highly recommend it, easy to book online. A great apres ski idea before dinner. The staff and owners were great!"
