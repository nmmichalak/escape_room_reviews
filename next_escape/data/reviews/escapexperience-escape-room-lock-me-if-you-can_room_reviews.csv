"Escape room ""Lock Me If You Can"" by EscapeXperience Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapexperience-escape-room-lock-me-if-you-can,0,Great time! First time ever going to an escape room. We finished in 50 min. Good thing my gf is a genius or we would have never made it out on time. Would definitely go back and try another room.

"Escape room ""Lock Me If You Can"" by EscapeXperience Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapexperience-escape-room-lock-me-if-you-can,2,"Overall, I am a little mixed on this review, although it is mainly because it is impossible for me not to compare to another room we had done the same day with a very similar theme and story. Lock Me If You Can had some challenging puzzles and a few confusing things, and we did enjoy our time here.At first glance, all is good, but after spending time inside, it got weird. Unfortunately, I cannot share more without giving things away, but it also didn't help that we'd done another prison room that was awesome earlier in the day.In general, the quality was pretty good, but there were a couple of things that were hard to get working. We spent a pretty decent amount of time on a single puzzle mainly because of supplies and layout, not because we didn't know what to do with it.We had a good time with this one, once we got past the frustrating puzzles."

The room makes no logical sense, the puzzles are cheesy, and the flow is just odd. This place comes off more as a money grabber opportunity than a good escape room. Avoid."

We were in a group with another couple so it was just the four of us. We did the ""Lock me if you can"" room and didn't make it out. Bummer but I still had a great time and will be back to try the others. Staff was very friendly!"
"Escape room ""Lock Me If You Can"" by EscapeXperience Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapexperience-escape-room-lock-me-if-you-can,5,Our group of ten friends had an amazing time trying to break out from prison. We didn't escape but we got really close! Fun and frivolity was had by all! I would highly recommend a visit. I would love to do one of the other rooms soon.
