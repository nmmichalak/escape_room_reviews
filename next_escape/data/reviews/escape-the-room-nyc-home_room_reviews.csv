"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,0,"What an adrenaline rush! Our group did the home and as other people mentioned, it's a great oportunity for people to get to know one another. Everyone on our team contributed something so it was truly a team effort. Can't wait to do more!"
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,1,"So much fun!We went late on Monday to do the home.  There was a small group of people doing the agency at 11pm that only had 3 people so we ended up staying later and playing the agency as well. Both were fun but I enjoyed the home one more.The cluemaster will go over the rules briefly before you enter the room.  There is a coat rack inside all of the rooms so you can hang up your belongings.  Some rooms will have the cluemaster in the room with you (agency) while some rooms just have a camera set up (home) so that the cluemaster can relay hints to you through a monitor. You have one hour to get out of the room.If you don't go in a big group (~8 people), prepare to work with strangers. We introduced ourselves to all the people that were going to be in the rooms with us.Communication is key.  Make sure that everyone knows where the clues are and where the locks are in all the rooms.  We had people in both our groups pick up clues and forget where they put them- this ended ended up costing us precious minutes and also ended up in an awkward confrontation between two teammates (lol). If you're in the area, definitely stop by! I never thought I'd have this much fun being locked in a room!"
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,2,We went to the 'home' scene. Super fun and challenging! Will come back for the other rooms!
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,3,"If you like games and puzzles or just pretending like you're sherlock holmes, this place is GREAT!i was skeptical when my friend said it was $28 per person.. i was like ""there's no way this can be worth $30""and while i can't afford to play this game often, it really was an amazing experience. make sure to reserve in advance!! they have 3 diff types of rooms to escape from and each one is for a different number of people. i recommend trying to get a whole group of people you know to go together cuz this requires a lot of teamwork and it might be awkward trying to yell at a stranger to do something like ""CHECK OVER THERE!!!""Anyways... yeah, the clues were REALLY well made!! i was impressed. i felt like indiana jones at one point when i figured out a certain clue.. won't tell you which ;)but yeah, it's not something that someone put together in 5 minutes then they lock you in a room. it's a pretty hard puzzle. I heard only 20% of people get out. And i have to brag here but our team did make it out of the home (6 people) in 51min24sec!!   The frustration/hopelessness at the last 15minutes and then the feeling when you open the door... amazing. you must go experience it yourself. Just don't tackle your friends while trying to reach the door, which i almost did. So... i LOVED it! i will be back one day hopefully to try the other ones. i also recommend that you download the app/game Can You Escape and play the game (there's 1 and 2). it get's you in the mindset of looking for clues and how to play the game."
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,4,"Went here with a group of six to play ""Home.""  Originally more of our friends wanted to go together but the"" Home"" game only allowed for 6 players. Although we ultimately ran out of time But we had a great time being detectives. What I loved most about the escape NYC vs the mission escape is that they give you unlimited hints that prompts from a computer whenever we were stuck or on the right track. One of the workers monitor our progress via a security camera feed. Every time we heard the computer ""ping"" prompt we were so excited. Definitely an exciting game to play with friends. Would try the other room games at a later time. One thing I did not like was that the equipment was very old. Had the equipment not malfunction and the other equipment fit together like it should. We would had won. So very close. Next time. (They lost one star for old equipment, otherwise it would had been five stars.) When you play the game you will understand what I mean."
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,5,"It was really fun but by far the toughest escape room we did. We did ""home"" and couldn't finish it even after getting a lot of clues. We were 4 people when me and my wife did 3 other escape rooms in different countries in the past and I can definitely say it was the hardest. One of the crew members told us only 20% of the people actually succeeds escaping the room - which is very low."
"Escape room ""The Home"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-home,6,"Victory!!I'm just going to go out and say it...this game is a lot more fun if you actually manage to escape the room. Especially when you're playing with a good group of friends. Especially when this is for a birthday celebration and you've all just come from having drinks.Especially when you start off kind of slow...then you start working out the clues....the wheels in your heads start turning. There's the excitement of ideas and thoughts being thrown around, seemingly in a meaningless jumble, until the pieces start clicking together...people start having ""Eureka!"" moments (does anyone actually say that anymore?)...you start getting closer and closer..And then the ultimate rush, when you finally, FINALLY, get the key, with mere minutes left, and your friend jams it in the wrong keyhole and tries to open the wrong door.Thankfully, this was quickly corrected and we burst through the right door with 2 minutes to spare! Whew. It was an exhilarating high of excitement, delight, and just plain RELIEF. I have to give loads of credit to the creators of these games. These were not easy clues, and you really did need to use your brains on some of these. We did The Home, and I loved the whole set up. Our cluemaster was watching us on camera in another room, and would throw up clues on the TV monitor to help us. I liked how afterwards she walked us through the entire game to show us what we did..and what we didn't.Being a group of good friends with diverse backgrounds was not only ideal, in some ways I think it was necessary. We communicated well, played off each other's strengths, compensated for each other's weaknesses, and handled each other's stress. Definitely wouldn't go here with strangers or people I didn't know well. Birthday girl already wants to go back and play another room!"
