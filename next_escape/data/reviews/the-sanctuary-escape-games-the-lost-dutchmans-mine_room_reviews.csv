"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,0,"I did this yesterday for my birthday party with my friends and family, and I loved it. Best I've ever seen so far. It was so much fun and I can definitely call that my best party yet. It was amazing and I'm so glad I got to experience it, definitely challenging. So, overall, I loved the crap out of this escape room, definitely trying your other one soon."
"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,1,"A few friends and I have been hitting the escape rooms in the Oklahoma City Metro area and have enjoyed most of them. The six of us came to the Lost Dutchman's Mine thinking that we already had our top 5 escape rooms in OKC nailed down. We were wrong! This is unlike any other room in Oklahoma City, (until the owners of the rest come play this one, I know they will try to copy it to some extent) I have scratched my best 5 list out and replaced it with just this one! Until I have the chance to try the other one they have created, these guys know how to build quality in everything they do, the entire building is different than anything I have seen in the city.The set design is so well done and follows the backstory to the point that it is no longer an escape room, but a movie type experience. They have gone as far as mimicking the smells you would expect from the environment you are in. CRAZY amount of detail in every little thing they have done with this room!The puzzles are unlike any that we have come across (Not a combo lock in sight) And is so Indiana Jones-ish that I was afraid someone would open a box and melt my face!   If you have to pick just one escape room in OKC you would be crazy not to give this one a shot. It does not disappoint!"

And we have done quite a few of them. The owner was very friendly and welcoming which is something you don't get at every escape game. Can't wait to come back!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,3,"My family of 3 did the Dutchman's Lost Mine. The hosts were great and told an excellent story background. Once inside the room, it is so immersive that you feel like you are in a different time and place! We felt like we were on a movie set! The puzzles and challenges were very creative but we needed help from the hosts. This escape room is worth a plane ride to OKC just to do this!!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,4,"This place is the real deal! We just did the Dutchman's Mine, and it's so immersive you feel you're truly in the story. I've been to almost all OKC escape rooms, and I've now found my favorite. So many things set this place apart that make it not just fun and good, but great and exciting! I can't wait for them to make more rooms!!!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,5,"This is by far the absolute best escape room in Oklahoma, and the best escape room I've ever visited. We drove almost two hours one way to visit this escape room, and it was TOTALLY worth it! Our group of 8 participated in the Lost Dutchman's Mine, and it is the most detailed escape room I've ever seen in real life or in my online research. I wholeheartedly recommend this escape room to anyone who enjoys challenges, teamwork, and good, clean fun!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Dutchman's Mine"" by The Sanctuary Escape Games in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/the-sanctuary-escape-games-the-lost-dutchmans-mine,6,"We have played escape rooms in 5 states, probably 10 rooms in all. Tonight we did the Lost Dutchman's Mine room, and it was the best of them all hands down. The detail and creativity put in were amazing - even just in the lobby.Once inside the room itself, it's obvious that the owner spent much time and money building this and didn't cut corners. All five of us commented immediately how well it was designed. The story, the clues, and the flow of the Dutchman is very well thought out. This isn't the typical lock and key type of room. Not even close. Everything works together and everything has a purpose. I will also note that the quality and engineering was top notch.I cannot recommend it enough."
