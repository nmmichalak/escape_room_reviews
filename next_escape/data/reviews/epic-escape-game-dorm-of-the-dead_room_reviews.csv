My sister and I started off with the Dorm of the dead, we actually were right at the last clue but we ran out of time! We loved it so much we booked another one for the same day immediately after! After that we did the Mustache Thief and NAILED IT with 15 min to spare! It was so fun! The Dorm of the Dead was fantastic, there were two other people with us in the room and a group of four was perfect! The design and set surprises were so amazing! Someone put a lot of time into the design! It blew us away! Because the Dorm of the Dead is the 2nd hardest and it was our first time I think we would have nailed it if we had done the mustache one first because we would have known a bit more what to expect.. But then again they are about the same difficulty and they are designed so differently.. We were in a group totaled up of 8 for the mouse ache thief and we had so much fun! We were cheering every clue we unlocked, laughed a lot and had so much fun working as a team! I can't wait to find more room escape games in the country! This is a must do! We are going to to the Pikes Peak (moderate) and the Other Side (hardest) next time I come back to visit!! I can't wait to come back to this place!! So much fun!! It's like a reality video/board game with great stage props and I wish they had these all the time everywhere!!"

Although we didn't finish, we were within 3 puzzles of finishing - as just a 2some!!! Kudos to the guys for an awesome experience. First timers from out town, and if we get back, we'll do it again!!!!!"

I used to be a dating coach and matchmaker and always told people that activity dates are the best for getting to know each other and for generating attraction. This is perfect!!! What a great way to get to know someone!!

We went for my birthday and I took my kids, boyfriend and mom and dad. All though we had a blast, I would say for first timers we picked the wrong room. We did the dorm of the dead and it was very hard. I give it up to the people who made that room, it was not joke. The workers there were very nice and our clue master was very nice and patient with us. I will say if you have kids or it's your first time going choice the toy room. I can't wait to go back and try the easier room to really get the understanding of the room. Our clue master stayed with us 30 minutes after time had expired just to see and help us understand and get through the room. That was very nice of him. I would say everybody should try the epic escape game!!! I can't wait to go back and try it again!!!"

Can't wait to escape next time. Everything was well thought out and it was a lot more challenging than I expected. When you hear ""21% success rate"", take it seriously and don't assume you're automatically smarter than 79% of the population (especially if you've never done anything like this before)!"
