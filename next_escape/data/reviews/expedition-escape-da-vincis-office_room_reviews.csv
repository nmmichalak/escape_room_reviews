"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Office"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-da-vincis-office,0,My siblings and I had an awesome time tonight. We did the Da Vinci's Office and the girl working was awesome and very professional and pleasant. We would have escaped if we had an additional 20 seconds! We will be back again for sure.
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Office"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-da-vincis-office,1,The first room we did at the Montgomery location was DaVinci's Office. Really fun room and challenge. Jacob was our guide and he gave just the right amount of clues so that we were able to complete the room while still leaving the room a challenge. He was excited for us that the two of us were able to escape.
