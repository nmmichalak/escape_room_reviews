We had a blast, and the rooms required that everyone work together. By the end we were all screaming and jumping up and down, hugging each other! The staff were very helpful and kind."

On May 28th I visited this escape game particularly because it was the only place that could accommodate 12 of us in the same room.  I spoke to several employees on different occasions and each time they were patient and very polite! We were originally 8 and grew 4 times, eventually becoming 12. I know it must have been frustrating dealing with our party changing several times & us arriving an hour late on top of everything. The night went perfect! We escaped and had so much fun doing so!! Definitely recommend!!! A MUST!"

Perfect place to take kids, friends, family and co-workers. I took some of my employees as a team building exercise and everyone loved it. It is challenging and fun. Staff is always awsome"
