"Escape room ""Escape the Time Machine 2"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-escape-the-time-machine,0,"Our first experience in an escape room...and we loved it.  We really did feel as though we had stepped back in time.  A lot of fun puzzles/clues and the game/room master was very helpful with his hints.  There were four of us...we didn't escape, but we were soooo close! "

Playing the ""Time-Machine"" room with just the two of us was challenging. The puzzles are easy enough to get you really going. Some puzzles within the game may seem to be overwhelming, but keep trying. Ask for help when you are really stuck. Their clues are not that vague to where it is confusing.A great place to have friends and family enjoy their time and co-workers to build teamwork! Definitely would return and play with friends and family!"
"Escape room ""Escape the Time Machine 2"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-escape-the-time-machine,2,This was my first escape room experience and it was super fun and really utilized our teamwork and collaboration skills! Definitely a brain exercise that makes you think outside the box and what was especially cool was the detail that made you feel like you stepped into a time machine! A must try!
"Escape room ""Escape the Time Machine 2"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-escape-the-time-machine,3,"This was my third escape room game, but I have to say it was a very good one! We were a group of five and had a blast during an hour. The different mysteries we had to solve were very well planned and new to everything I could have seen before. I would definitely recommend that to everyone (English speaking or not) who is ready for an hour of fun and excitement!"
"Escape room ""Escape the Time Machine 2"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-escape-the-time-machine,4,"This was my and my boyfriend's first experience with an escape room -- and Codebreakers sets the bar high! Corrine, the owner, was extremely kind, genuine, personal, helpful, and reassuring, and her passion truly shined through in the conversations we had with her. The diner room's theming was super cute, the backstory was quite a bit of fun, and the technology associated within added a layer of fun interactivity. Each puzzle was exciting and fun, and it all seemed to flow together smoothy. Highly recommend for couples, families, business outings, team building, birthday parties, and any opportunity you're looking for to have some fun!"
