"Escape room ""Camped Out"" by Escapades in Sioux Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/sioux-falls/quests/escapades-camped-out,0,"Context, we've done over 30 rooms, many with our children. This room was OK, but not great. It felt like it was designed by someone new to designing rooms and they were cutting their teeth on this one. Some of the puzzles we're just oddly sequenced or had solutions that you end up just kind of saying, Ok, whatever to.  Some of the locks were worn out and took a few tries to open. Overall, not a bad room, but pretty middle of the road."
