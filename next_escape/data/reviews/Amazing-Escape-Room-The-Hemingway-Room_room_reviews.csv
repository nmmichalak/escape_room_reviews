"Escape room ""The Jungle"" by Amazing Escape Room in Freehold",https://worldofescapes.com/freehold/quests/Amazing-Escape-Room-The-Hemingway-Room,0,"Such a disappointment!! Horrible customer service!! We had a large group and paid $300 for a room. We were unfortunately a few minutes late due to a traffic incident and tried to call to alert them but the call went straight to voicemail. When we arrived they docked us the time and said it was due to the next groups arrival. We were only two moves from finishing when they ended our time. We came out of the room to a completely empty lobby. When we left, they locked the door behind us. There was no one after us, they simply didn't want to allow us the lost 10 minutes. After paying that much, this was extremely disappointing! We have done dozens of escape rooms and have never been met with such bad customer service. We would absolutely not recommend this place!! There are so many better places nearby, the room was mediocre at best!!"

You can tell they just rented a building and threw a bunch of props and locks in each room. The staff is young and nice, they are probably the best thing this place has to offer.The decor, lighting, locks, and everything else just feels really dated. We did the Jungle room and for the amount of money they charge they should definitely step their game up. Keep in mind they group you with strangers. We came with 5 people, and there was two little kids in the room, and they were just crowding every puzzle, and basically wasting our time, which means they are wasting my money."

Is this it? Looks are so deceiving! Great place, fun, makes you feel so dumb..yet so smart. Was so close I will avenge myself. I will be back. The staff was great, help you so much, if you want it. I recommend it any day!"
