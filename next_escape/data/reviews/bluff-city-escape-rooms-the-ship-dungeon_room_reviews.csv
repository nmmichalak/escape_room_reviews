"Escape room ""Ship Dungeon"" by Bluff City Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/bluff-city-escape-rooms-the-ship-dungeon,1,Almost hard to decide where to start with not many props around buuut it was an insane room and the thought put into it was so neat. We GOT out! And enjoyed the end the most! It'll work your puzzle solving skills but I would definitely recommend this room because it was so fun for us! Very nice job on this room! Only us 2 played and loved it and were thrilled to get out for the first time!
