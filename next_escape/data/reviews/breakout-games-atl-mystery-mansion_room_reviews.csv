"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/breakout-games-atl-mystery-mansion,1,"One of the best breakout games ever! My team broke out, so that made it even better. They have a huge variety of games which was super cool too. A little hard to find when you don't know the area, but we found it. Maybe if they put up a bigger sign that would help."

It's full of surprises, and 3 hints didn't seem like enough! Just about every minor detail of the room was needed to breakout. Even though my group and I didn't escape, I'll definitely be back. And Sophia, our game master, was awesome!"
