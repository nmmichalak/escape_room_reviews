"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-antidote,0,"We did the Antidote room with a group of 8 and had an excellent time from start to finish. The clues were creative and fun to figure out, and the room was extremely well themed and fun to make our way through. Great for all ages. Would definitely go again to try another room!"
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-antidote,1,"I had a great time at this escape room. My room was the Antidote room. The atmosphere was very immersive, the alarms adding a great sense of suspense to punctuate the time crunch. The puzzles were great fun to solve, and unlocking all the doors felt very satisfying. It was a real sweat dropper in the end, but my team (just two of us) managed to escape by the skin of our teeth (just a minute on the clock left) which made the victory all the sweeter. Hope to come back soon to try out the Budapest room."

We tried the antidote first since it was in the mid difficult. We almost lost actually, we had 3mins and few seconds left before we escaped. It does test your logic and teamwork. Great for friends, families, or couples."
