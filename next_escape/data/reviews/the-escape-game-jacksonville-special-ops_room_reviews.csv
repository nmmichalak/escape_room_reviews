"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-special-ops,0,"I have done a decent amount of these and picked this place out of production quality standards. The best. Collin...can’t say enough about how amazing of a job he does. I worked with them to propose to my now fiancé. They went above and beyond any expectations, helped me through every part of it, and made it incredibly special for us. Go here, have fun."
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-special-ops,1,"Out of all the escape rooms I've done, this maybe the best as far as really setting the atmosphere. It is amazing how much detail they put into the room! We did the Spec Ops room and it was a lot of fun. The clues were put together well and you didn't have to be a mind reader to get out. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because our room did have some technical difficulties. We didn't know if we were doing something wrong or if it was the room. At the end of the game, a manager came and apologized. He even gave us a free game for another day. I would come back even if it wasn't free, can't wait to try a new room!"
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-special-ops,2,"This place is awesome! The staff is friendly, and professional. The whole feel of the place is very modern, especially the use of technology in the games which was very impressive. They do seem to be a little more expensive than other escape rooms, but I definitely think the price is worth it. We played special ops and escaped with only 2 minutes, we had a group of 6 and were definitely challenged but still had a blast!! They also do a great job with letting you know you can always hit a button to leave the room for a restroom break, which is perfect for anyone who is anxious about the general concept of these games."
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-special-ops,3,For my first time going to an escape room it was really fun. The staff was amazing in the fact that they asked if we had any questions about the rooms and helped us decide which room to go to. Me and my family had a lot of fun in the special ops room. I recommend this for an activity for all families to enjoy.
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-special-ops,4,We successfully escaped special ops: mysterious market and dared to do prison break the next day! The staff was very friendly and considerate and helped us from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. After our first escape game they offered to take our picture and we also were offered a discount for our next game which made us more inclined to come the next morning. If I ever stop by again I'm definitely going to try out their new playground room!!
