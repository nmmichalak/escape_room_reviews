We were blown away. Fantastic in every way, can't recommend enough. Owner was very friendly with the right amount of helpfulness and intrigue.

"Escape room ""Relativity Room: 1939"" by Smart Rooms in Lincoln",https://worldofescapes.com/lincoln/quests/smart-rooms-the-relativity-room,4,I went with a group of co-workers for a work outing and it was a fantastic time! I'm one of those people that used to play online escape rooms all the time and to do it in person was pretty epic. The room was challenging and fun and we were so happy we figured everything out in time to escape!
