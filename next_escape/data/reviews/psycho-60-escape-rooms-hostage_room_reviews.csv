"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Psycho 60 Escape Rooms in Winston-Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/winston-salem/quests/psycho-60-escape-rooms-hostage,0,"It was a fun puzzle. We didn't make it out alive but that had something to do with my niece picking the hardest room (Hostage) and us never having done an escape room before. Mike, the game master, was great and we had a fun time."
