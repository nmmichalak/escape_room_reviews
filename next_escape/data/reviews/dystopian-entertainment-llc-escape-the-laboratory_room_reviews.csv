"Escape room ""Escape The Laboratory"" by Dystopian Entertainment LLC in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/dystopian-entertainment-llc-escape-the-laboratory,0,"Just did this room tonight with my girlfriend. We opted to do the 'hard mode' version which is 5 additional puzzles. It's a really cool room as the whole thing is a bunch of linear puzzles where each set of 5 has their own start. We ended up finishing with 30 something minutes left and the guy was generous enough to reset the remaining 2 rows of puzzles (normally done with large groups) so that we could do the rest of them. I really enjoyed this room as it was full of all sorts of different puzzles from logic, to word, and everything in between. They really make use of every possible type of puzzle as no two are alike. Definitely one of the more enjoyable Gen-1 rooms I have done.  "

Yes, it did lack a storyline, but made it up with the amazing puzzles! My group had 5 people and we were able to solve 5 rows with about 2 minutes to spare! Lots a fun and one of the funniest escape rooms out there. We would of loved if this place had a second room because we would of definitely came back. Hopefully they open a second one and we will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Escape The Laboratory"" by Dystopian Entertainment LLC in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/dystopian-entertainment-llc-escape-the-laboratory,2,"This is a very well done escape room game with a couple of cool aha! moments. It's perfect for a large group that works well when broken into in smaller groups. Its multi-path style allows for small groups to play together in a public game and still work mostly with their own players within the larger team. It's a weak on story, but very puzzle heavy."
