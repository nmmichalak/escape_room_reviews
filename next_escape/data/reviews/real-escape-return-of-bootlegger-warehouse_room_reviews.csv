"Escape room ""Return of Bootlegger Warehouse"" by Real Escape in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/real-escape-return-of-bootlegger-warehouse,0,"I've done around 15 escape rooms and this one is my least favorite so far. Without giving anything away, there were about 100 keys in this room, if not more... The room didn't require much skill, most of the time we were just trying every key on every lock until we got the right one.... It was pretty annoying."

We did both rooms available in one day and both were very different and challenging. Will definetly be back to try the new rooms when they come up!!

It was challenging and forces you to work together with your team, so pick people you like and work well with. My team rocked, we only used two clues and made it out with 20 minutes to spare ï¿½ we all had a great time and can't wait to go back."
