"Escape room ""Investigation of a Miss Treedeath"" by Escape MSP in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-msp-investigation-of-a-miss-treedeath,0,I had a great time doing Ms. Treedeaths escape room. We made it out with no time to spare. The experience was super fun. I was in a group of seven and we had to work non-stop to barely finish in an hours time. It is the perfect amount of problem solving for this amount of time. We felt rushed enough to hurry and still made it barely. I will definitely try to go again.

So much to do and just the right level of difficulty for some who were experienced and some who were new to escape rooms. One of our favorites. Will go back to do the other rooms that they have.

They've both exceeded my expectations. The production value is extremely high, the puzzles are challenging but not impossible, and getting out is SO rewarding. I really love that each room has a story behind it and you're working towards an objective - not just random puzzles. I just wish they had more rooms - I only have one more to do!"
