Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-cereal-killer,0,We did Cereal Killer and Labyrinth and both were so much fun. The puzzles were great and we were really drawn into how the rooms flowed from puzzle to puzzle. The owner was so friendly and personable.

We took on serial killer and it was a huge thrill. If you think you are good, this room will test everything you have. So complex and well put together. George was great and treated everyone amazing. Do not go anywhere else. Thanks for an amazing experience."
