"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-special-ops,0,"I was invited to go to the Escape Game with a work-group. We had a large group so we separated into two games, Gold Rush and Special Ops. I played the special Ops game and it was filled with twist and turns. We escaped with 12 seconds to spared and had a blast. I highly recommend the game to everyone. Also, the people who work there were friendly and really made the experience."
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-special-ops,1,"special ops was a blast!I had never played an Escape Game before, but when my friend Kallie (who works at the Orlando Escape Game) took us to play when we visited Chicago. She wanted us to play Special Ops because her Escape Game didn’t offer it and none of us had ever played before. I really didn’t know what to expect but I ended up having such a blast! At one point the audio to the video cut out but one of the workers was kind enough to come relay what had been said so we could figure out the game. We finished with about 15 minutes to spare!! I had so much fun playing and definitely want to come back or visit other locations."

It was challenging and very well planned out. We have been to many escape rooms and the production in this venue was excellent. We will return!
