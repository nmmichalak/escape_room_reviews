"Escape room ""Wizard's Castle"" by Play Live Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/castle-escape-room-castle-escape-room,0,What an amazing experience- highly recommend it!! We came all the way from San Francisco and we loved the concept!! We did the the Castle room which had a very nice setup with 3d walls and very well thought out puzzles. The atmosphere and our host were super nice and entertaining. Would definitely do it again and would recommend to anyone who loves a challenge while being entertained!!!

We did the Wizard's Castle escape and it was great for beginners. Just challenging enough to feel really good when you figure something out. I recommend this for casual escapers looking for a fun evening.

We took our son and his friends to the ""easiest"" escape room (Gnomes and Wizard's Castle). This was our first experience at an escape room, so many of the hints were not as obvious for us and needed to get some help along the way.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with the children.  The kids had so much fun going through and solving the puzzles!  We are looking to go back to do the other rooms as well.  Thank you guys for a great time out with the kids!"
