"Escape room ""Save Christmas Dinner"" by Beast Escape Room in Glen Carbon",https://worldofescapes.com/glen-carbon/quests/Beast-Escape-Room-SAVE-CHRISTMAS-DINNER,0,"What a blast. The puzzles were challenging, but solvable. The owner is engaging and fun to talk to. We got very close, but didn't finish in time. We have to try the second room. Great experience for our family and couple close friends!"
