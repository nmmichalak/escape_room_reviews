"Escape room ""Final Frontier"" by Missing Pieces Escape Games in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/missing-pieces-escape-games-final-frontier,0,It was my son's 13th birthday and we chose Final frontier. It is the hardest and was so much fun! The owner is super friendly and we will definitely do another one if we are back in the area (we live in CT). Definitely made my son's day.
