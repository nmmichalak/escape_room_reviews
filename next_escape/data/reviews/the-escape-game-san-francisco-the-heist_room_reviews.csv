"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-the-heist,0,"This place is a win all around. I’ve never seen such well put together rooms. It was like the props you see at Disneyland. The stories were detailed and fun and the staff add extra icing on the cake for being the nicest people! I highly recommend, especially The Heist game.This place is a win all around. I’ve never seen such well put together rooms. It was like the props you see at Disneyland.

Very fun with good interactive set, and the right balance of hard but solveable puzzles. The only thing is that I can't imagine having more than 5 or 6 people in that room - we were lucky enough to not get grouped with anyone else and thought 4 was the perfect size."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-the-heist,2,All the doors were locked!!My group and I did the heist room. I was nervous at first because this was only my 2nd escape game ever but the staff were really warm and welcoming and room itself was a lot of fun. As we unlocked each door the puzzles got harder and harder. What I really liked was how well themed each room was. Really clean and nicely decorated. Even the mechanics of things opening and closing were really done well. I would definitely go again for another room.I went with a group of 8 total people(the max) and it felt a little too cramped at times so I would suggest to go with no more then 5 people.

We can't wait to do it again. My Baby Boomer husband and I, along with our 22 year old son, joined a group of five young teens and we all had a blast in the ""Heist"" game which was extremely challenging and well thought out. Only one person in our group had participated in an escape room game before and when we left, all of us said we would highly recommend it. What an intense and exhilarating hour!  You won't be disappointed if the other games were as good as the Heist. The San Francisco location is brand new and the staff is doing a great job."

We had a lot of fun in ""The Heist"" room. The puzzles and clues were very creative and well designed! Highly recommended for team building experience! We will definitely come back!"
