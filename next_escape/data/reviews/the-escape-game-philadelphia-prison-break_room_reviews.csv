"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Philadelphia in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/the-escape-game-philadelphia-prison-break,0,Did the prison break room with a group of 8 of us and had a blast! Also completed the gold rush room with a group of 6 and felt like we had a good group. The rooms are so well themed and the puzzles match their difficulty rankings. The staff is super friendly and does a great job getting the group on par with the theme of the room! We loved both experiences here and will definitely be back!
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Philadelphia in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/the-escape-game-philadelphia-prison-break,1,Our team of six took on the prison break game and had an incredible time. We were 5 adults and 1 teen with varying degrees of experience. This game was a 9/10 in difficulty. The clues were helpful without spoiling anything and still providing a good challenge. Whoever came up with this game is quite clever. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Philadelphia in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/the-escape-game-philadelphia-prison-break,2,This was my first time doing an escape room.... we stupidly picked the hardest one thinking it would be a quick easy thing! NOT THE CASE! It was a fun action packed puzzle with so many twits and turns. We would have never been able to finish without our wonderful game guide! I can’t say much without giving away clues... but what I can say is when I’m back in the area I WILL be going back to try Gold Rush!

They were so accommodating and even gave us a sneak preview of one escape room.  They booked us accordingly and we had no issue in the waiting room!! I forgot the staffs name but they all were so so friendly and energetic, it's so close to perfect!! The actual escape rooms are very nice and detailed.  The rooms were clean and made you feel like you were in that specific atmosphere.  We did the prison break one and it was awesome!! Highly recommend!!!! Will be back to do another one!!!!"

The accommodated our group of 9 easily (the max is 8 online), and we all had a great time.We chose the prison escape. It was super hard and we definitely needed the clues and additional time,  but it was very interesting and fun. The room took a little over an hour. We got to go to different scenes as we got closer to ""escaping"". All the rooms were very well done and looked awesome.  We also got to  take some pictures when we were all done.Definitely come here. We all agreed we'd be back for more and different escapes!Bonus: Yard House is literally next door to grab a drink/food for before or after!"
