"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by ROOM 5280 in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/room-5280-the-experiment,0,"Our family was in town and looking for something to do to kill some time.  We did the experiment room and had a great time.  Our host was very good and amusing.  We did escape with a few hints from the host.  It was the first escape room experience for most in our group, and they all loved it.  I would highly recommend."
"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by ROOM 5280 in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/room-5280-the-experiment,1,"I've been to an escape room once before by a different company and did not have a great time and was very hesitant on going to another. I had a lot of friends in town suggesting we do one and found Room 5280. This experience was unforgettable. It had unique and creative puzzles for everyone. We had a group of 6. Many of the puzzles went over my head, but others in the group were able to solve them while the same applied vice versa.We did The Experiment and couldn't have had a better time. It was in a safe part of the city and the staff were very welcoming and friendly."
