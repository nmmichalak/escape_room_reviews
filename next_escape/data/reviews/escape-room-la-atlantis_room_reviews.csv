"Escape room ""Atlantis"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-atlantis,0,"I went back to Escape Room LA and played their newest room -- The Atlantis. Like all of their rooms, it's beautiful. It features a variety of different types and levels of puzzles. It's the perfect room for experienced enthusiasts as well as newcomers because there is a lot to do in this room. It's absolutely beautiful!I really like their rooms and for someone who tends to not like public bookings, this company's public booking policy doesn't bother me. For this room, I usually end up playing with a lot of newcomers and they tend to be quite easy going and terrific at working together. It's fun meeting new people and seeing what they come up with and finding solutions together. Because I've played their rooms before, it's easy to navigate and know when the in room game master is providing subtle hints, which are very useful. Watch your in room game master. If she/he is looking at something, it's probably best if a couple of people in your group see what they are looking at because there is an order to solving the puzzles in the different rooms.In terms of parking, I've usually found metered parking or I've walked to the venue or even have taken the subway and walked a little bit. The area is not fancy, but what area is in downtown Los Angeles.I like Escape Room LA's rooms a lot. I think their set designs are phenomenal and a bar above what many others are doing."
