"Escape room ""Extinct"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-extinct,0,"This was one of the more disappointing rooms I've done (out of 20+). We went with four people and only did the red side. There were really only four puzzles to solve in aggregate and no really satisfying discovery of surprises along the way. This reminded of some of the earliest escape rooms, before designers really upped their game. We lost about five minutes on one puzzle that had a stuck button before we fixed it and could move on.The staff seemed attentive; no concerns on that front.This is their easiest room, which we only chose based on availability as we only had the one night free; hopefully their other rooms are more interesting and engaging.

The owner was super attentive to all of our feedback and I could tell he was genuinely intent on creating the best user experience possible. The puzzles were unique and challenging, but not frustratingly so. The rooms weren't too dark or claustrophobic. I recommend Alcatraz to anyone looking for a good, intellectually challenging time."

We did the Extinct room and it was so fun!! The guy who helped us was super nice. I think his name was Ryker! We will for sure be coming here again!

As someone who has gone to about two dozen escape rooms, I can say the puzzles were silly without logical answers. The game master did not tell us a story (there was none). Puzzles are linear, so you must finish one before going to the next. At some point we had to do a sudoku puzzle for fifteen minutes in the middle of the room using markers that were out of ink on a handheld whiteboard (so reproducing the grid ourselves...after finishing it they told us we could write on their monitors). In the end I felt insulted due to the low quality puzzles, having four people all working on a sudoku puzzle together for 15 minutes, and the high cost for such a crap room. I wanted to talk to the owner, they said they had no contact information and I could call the main phone number. Other rooms at this place have great reviews, but I'm worried to do because of my terrible experience with Extinct. Never do this room.  I feel as if I had done the red side the room would've been equally as bad."
