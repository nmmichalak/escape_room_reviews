"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-special-ops,0,We have done both the gold rush and special ops rooms and both were truly excellent. Both rooms had puzzles and features that were truly unique when compared to other local escape room franchises in the area (and we have tried quite a few!). The staff were very friendly and good about giving pertinent clues when you asked for a clue and helping to keep you moving along without giving you too much help. A perfect balance. We will definitely be back to do their other rooms.

"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-special-ops,2,"The Special Ops Escape Room was challenging and very fun! The detailed and realistic props really set the stage for the experience. We were instantly immersed in the environment -- smells, sounds, the temperature of the room, as well as the props were amazing. We all loved the experience and look forward to returning to try our hand at the other rooms."
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-special-ops,3,"My friends and I did the Special Ops room and it was a lot of fun. The game and room design were very detailed and immersive in the theme. It was honestly pretty tough with the amount of different challenges to solve in under an hour, compared to another escape room I did in the past. Quite a few of the people in my group had never done an escape room before this one, but it's safe to say we all have a new fervor for the game and will return again soon to try our luck with the other rooms (and reclaim our dignity.)"
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-special-ops,4,"I participated in the ""Special Ops"" mission today for my little brother's birthday. I was skeptical because I'd done escape rooms before and thought they were kind of a bland fad. The adventure blew my mind, however, with its intricate design and thrilling plot details. The location also can't be beat in the heart of Cincinnati overlooking the Ferris wheel and suspension bridge. It's a great place to go to for a birthday as well as my brother got ice cream, a shirt and a card signed by the super kind staff. I'm excited to try another game in the future!"
