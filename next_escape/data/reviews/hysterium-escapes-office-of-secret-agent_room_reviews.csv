"Escape room ""Office of Secret Agent 22"" by Hysterium Escapes in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/hysterium-escapes-office-of-secret-agent,0,"This place was the only escape room open on Sunday's in the Ft Wayne area. The rooms were not very professionally constructed and the atmosphere was not very high quality, yet they charge the same price, or more, than the wonderful escape rooms in Indianapolis.We did both the Agent 22 room and the serial killer room. Both rooms were fun but the clues and the tasks seemed a bit more amateur than all the others that we have done. Additionally, there were not multiple rooms to discover. They are a haunted house business that has implemented these rooms to offset the off season."
