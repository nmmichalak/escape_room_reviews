"Escape room ""Chinatown"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-chinatown,0,"Truly a blast! I have only had experience with one escape room before - my office did the whole ""team bonding"" thing. Anywhoo! This time I got a group of friend together and the room/experience by far exceeded the first. A few points to highlight...The room - the room itself was very well done. The decor and space. Something I didn't love about the first escape room was how small and crowded it felt. We did the ""Chinatown"" theme and they did a great job giving a restaurant feel.The clues/ puzzle pieces - what really set this place apart was the clues! Again, comparing it to my last experience, there were far less obvious clues which really made us think and work as a team. More importantly the type of puzzle pieces they engineered were phenomenal and extremely creative. Not to give anything away, but you really have to exercise all options with everything in the room touching, aligning, and pushing. Nothing came too easy with this room! Customer service - the girl who assisted us was polite and sweet. Plus, the few times we did have to ask for hints, she gave us the perfect nudge in the right direction. All in all a great experience. I will defiantly be forming a new team and heading back soon!"

We barely escaped but I think it would have been better if we had a couple more people.  The 3 of us had done a few escape rooms before, but this was by far the most fun. The room was decorated in a way that made you feel like you were really in a restaurant in Chinatown. The owner Greg was also super accommodating as the same afternoon of our reservation we were going to run late. He was really nice and put us in at a later spot, which was still open. He didn't have to do that, so we really appreciate it. Staff was also very nice. The clues were also really helpful when we needed them. Can't wait to come back to do the other rooms!!"
