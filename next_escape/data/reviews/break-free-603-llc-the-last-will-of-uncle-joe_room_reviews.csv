"Escape room ""The Last Will of Uncle Joe"" by Break Free 603, LLC in Amherst",https://worldofescapes.com/amherst/quests/break-free-603-llc-the-last-will-of-uncle-joe,0,"We did the Last Will and Testament room which, while difficult, was a lot of fun. We did this for my son's 12th birthday with four of his friends. This was the first time that we had done an escape room and really enjoyed it. The staff is great and helps you along the way if you get stuck. We will definitely do it again especially as they are planning to add additional rooms. If you are looking for something new and different to do close to home, check them out."
