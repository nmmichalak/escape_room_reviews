"Escape room ""Cartman's Escape Room"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-cartmans-escape-room,1,"This was my first escape room. We had a group of 5 and we had a blast. Apparently Trey Parker and Matt Stone were personally involved in the design of this room. If you are a fan of the show you'll notice that the classroom is on point with the show.  Unfortunately we got to the last room but didn't finish. The puzzles were clever and challenging. The effects were nice with lighting, drones, Cartman on the loud speaker, and people banging on doors. With each puzzle we solved we felt a satisfying sense of accomplishment. Great humor and great time. If you're a fan of the show, I highly recommend the room. If you're not then you'll probably pay for humor you won't appreciate."

You do not need to be a big South Park fan to enjoy it, but you will be excited if you are. This room is hard! The puzzles are exciting and make you work. I wish I could play it over again and would love to see more rooms with pop culture themes!"
