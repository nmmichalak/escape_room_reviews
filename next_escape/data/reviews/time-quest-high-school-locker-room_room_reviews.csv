"Escape room ""The Jungle"" by Time Quest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/time-quest-high-school-locker-room,2,I hope I am reviewing the right room as this was located on Dixie Highway not governors highway.  I took my four kids here last weekend for some fun and bonding.  We did the jungle room which was very cute.  It was not too hard although a few of the cues were far fetched.  There were a few surprises.  The kids were engaged throughout (teenagers) and we ALMOST cracked the code.  They showed us the last few clues we missed.  We had a good time.
