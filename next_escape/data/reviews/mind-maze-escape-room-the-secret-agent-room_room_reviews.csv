The people who own it are so sweet and the owner is a navy veteran and everyone we came into contact with there were so nice. We will definitely be going back next time we come into town. Overall a great experience both times!

Such a fun time for a group. We accomplished the Secret Agent room with ten people (and our outside lifeline Patrick), with just minutes to spare! Great atmosphere, and staff."
