My group tackled their hardest room, The Caretaker, it was creepy and eerie, just in time for Halloween! It was so cool to see how immersive and just overall interactive the room itself was, the puzzles we're challenging but really cool to solve, and Jessica was an awesome game host when it came to helpful hints. Thanks again to the entire staff for making it a wonderful experience!"

We almost escaped from The Caretaker! The staff was super nice and engaging. I was thoroughly impressed. They gave us some riddles before the room was room was ready. The room was AMAZINGLY decorated. Blew every other room I've done out of the water! Great experience!
