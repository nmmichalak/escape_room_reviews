"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/Breakout-Lexington-Hostage,0,My family played the Hostage for my birthday. It was our first time playing the break out games. It was a great bonding experience which we talked and laughed about for a couple of hours afterwards. It was tough and maybe a little too complex for our first game. Our game master who was great said we picked the hardest game. We didn't break out but had fun trying.

If you haven't done one of these yet, you definitely should. I plan to go back and try more of the rooms."
