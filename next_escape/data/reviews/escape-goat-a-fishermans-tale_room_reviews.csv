"Escape room ""A Fisherman's Tale"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-a-fishermans-tale,1,"I cannot say enough great things about this room and this company. They are a family-owned and -run company with a strong theater background, and their love and passion for the Escape Room industry shines through in every room they've created. Their latest room, ""Fisherman's Tale"", is no exception - it was such a great room with so many different kinds of puzzles and effects. Even over a hundred rooms in, this room still managed to surprise us with puzzle types that we had never before encountered.If you only wanted to visit one company in the Orlando area and play multiple rooms at that one location, there is no question in my mind that I'd tell you to visit Escape Goat. Every single one of their rooms we've played has been a wonderful experience."
"Escape room ""A Fisherman's Tale"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-a-fishermans-tale,2,We played a Fisherman's Tale today and it was awesome!The people who run/own this Escape Game clearly put a lot of effort into making each clue and puzzle feel different and dynamic with the air of a family run and built passion project.The room was decorated beautifully with props and immersive items that only enhanced the experience. It wasn't overblown or overdone- it was a solidly well put together scenic landscape that I really appreciated while also trying to figure out all the different sorts of puzzles and challenges.Truly a great place with some fantastic workers!
