"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-do-not-disturb,0,"We did ""Do Not Disturb"" and our game masters were Sam and Mac. It was a pretty cool room. It's got quite a number of pretty clever puzzles for a room that small. Lots of cool gadgetry. The mood was pretty suspenseful but not excessively creepy. The staff was helpful and friendly too. One drawback was the puzzles were all pretty linear for the most part, i.e. you must solve A to get to B which leads to C.... so it wasn't very conducive to several people working in parallel. Good experience overall."
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-do-not-disturb,1,"I was informed that this particular room has only been in operation for about a month at the Dayton location. This was the first time Iâ€™d participated in a breakout room. There was 5 of us in my party and a party of 3 that joined us, as well. It was so much fun! Without giving away too many details - this room really makes you think and the more people the merrier, teamwork really pays off! There is someone watching you through camera the entire time and they can help answer questions and give hints - if everyone in your room agrees to get help! The more hints you ask for...the vaguer the hints get! Highly recommend this location and this room!"

My boyfriend, two friends, and I all had a great time! The puzzles are challenging, but related well together and are definitely doable. Matt was the best Game Master! He was a blast to work with throughout the experience. Thanks for a fun night!"
