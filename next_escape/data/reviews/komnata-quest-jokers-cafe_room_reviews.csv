"Escape room ""Joker’s Cafe"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-jokers-cafe,0,"We came here after completing all of the Komnata Manhattan rooms (which are AMAZING) and weren't disappointed. We started at the 104 West Street location and did Doctor Frankenstein and Hex of the Chinese Jewelry Box, then moved on to the 67 West Street location for Joker's Cafe and Bullets and Broken Hearts. These rooms are the BEST in NYC, hands down - and we've done dozens. Also, shout out to Chris at 67 West - he was one of the best game masters we've worked with!"
"Escape room ""Joker’s Cafe"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-jokers-cafe,1,I had a great experience at Komnata Quest. It was my first time doing a escape room and it was amazing. I did the Jokers Cafe which was super interesting. I will totally go back and do another escape. The key master Kyle was  very nice and great at explaining and starting the adventure of going into the jokers Cafe.
"Escape room ""Joker’s Cafe"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-jokers-cafe,2,"My review will be as a first time escape room participant, all other rooms I do will be judged by this one!I'm going to start with a small negative, this is in a weird location, we had to ask a random person inside to let us pass through a building to get there.Now the positive stuff!First, I liked that the rooms were thematic, I guess going into this I just pictured one big room with obscure paper clues and lock boxes.  It was much better than that.The puzzles were challenging but not so difficult you'd say 'Man no one with get that.'. We did the Joker (of Batman universe) room and really had a blast!  At the end I really liked that they could recap with you, like we did something by mistake, that worked.  Then telling us that made the experience that much deeper!Staff was super friendly, and I particularly liked the We Won options.Honestly we're going to make the trip again from PA to try their other location."
