"Escape room ""Merlin's Wizarding Academy"" by Boxroom Escape Games in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/boxroom-escape-games-merlins-wizarding-academy,0,I've done quite a few escape rooms at different locations in Miami and Houston and this is one of my favorites! My friends and I started with the easiest room (Merlin) and got out with plenty of time to spare so it's probably best for people new to escape games! Can't wait to come back and try the other two rooms :)
