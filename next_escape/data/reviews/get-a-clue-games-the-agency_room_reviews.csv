Both rooms were great! Very challenging, yet enjoyable. Can't wait to return to do the Zodiac room! Staff is wonderful and very helpful. Highly recommend Get A Clue Games!"

I was apprehensive going in, but am a big fan coming out of it. We played the Spy Agency Game. The creativity, intricacy, and tech savvy were impressive. The level of difficulty was spot on - enough to add pressure and make it interesting, but not so much that it felt impossible. Every piece was well thought out, and there were so many surprises along the way. Don't miss out on this great time!"

Very friendly staff, and just the right amount of information ahead of time before getting into the room. Our group had 4 people, which felt perfect for our scenario. We were very impressed by the technology used in the Agency room and the attention to detail. Fully recommend!"
