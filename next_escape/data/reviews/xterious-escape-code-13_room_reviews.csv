"Escape room ""Code 13"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-code-13,1,"We had so much fun!!!! You pick a room with a storyline and you watch a short video that explains your scenario.  Then you go in and try to figure out how to meet your challenge. You are also given a walkie talkie to ask for hints if you need them, but the goal is to use the least amount of hints. We did Code 13 first and we loved it so much we went for a second round in Casino's Dark 11.The staff was incredibly friendly! They were nice introducing us to the game, and when needed, they helped us through the times we got stuck!It was so much fun and I want to thank the staff there for making it better with their amazing attitudes!!"
