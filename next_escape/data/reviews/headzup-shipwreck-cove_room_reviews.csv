"Escape room ""Shipwreck Cove"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-shipwreck-cove,0,My daughter and I just went here today and had a great time.  Staff was walking around offering to take pictures and pose us for the pictures as well.  We did the shipwreck escape room and my 5 year old had to ask for assistance a few times via the walkie talkie that was given to us and in the end we made it out with 2 minutes to spare.  We played checkers and jenja in the lounge while waiting for our turn in the escape room for some bonding and fun also  She had an amazing time and we will be back for sure.
