"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-special-ops-mysterious-market,0,"This was so much fun! As a matter of fact it was so much fun, we managed to complete all 4 rooms in 24 hours. It was a great way to interact and work cohesively with the whole family. For the 3rd room we did have to participate with another group of 2 and we were worried about that, but it turned out to be just as great. Not only was it incredibly fun but all the staff was amazing. They were upbeat, happy and helpful. Special thanks to Dani and Christopher for making sure we had a great time!"
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-special-ops-mysterious-market,1,"This past Friday a group of 4 of us tackled the game ""Special Ops: Mystery Market"" and were able to win with only seconds left in the game. Two from our group were enjoying their first-ever escape room and for all of us, this was our first time visiting this venue.I simply cannot speak highly-enough about the experience! Multiple rooms, engaging & challenging puzzles, along with a courteous gamemaster combined to make this an adventure well-worth the price of admission!We all are so stoked to book our next adventure here! I highly recommend adding this to the top of your list of ""must-do"" activities when visiting New Orleans!"

"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-special-ops-mysterious-market,4,Absolutely phenomenal. The rooms are so well planned and executed that you spend just as much time admiring their handiwork as you do working out the solutions to the puzzles. Our group tackled Playground and Black Ops and had a fantastic time in both rooms. The staff is friendly and helpful and really make go out of their way to make sure you have a great time. You can clearly tell that they love their jobs and have fun running the games for people. Can't wait to go back and experience the last 2 rooms and hope they bring more great games in the future.
