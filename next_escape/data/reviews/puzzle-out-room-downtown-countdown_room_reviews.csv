"Escape room ""Downtown Countdown"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-downtown-countdown,0,"I had a great time at Puzzle Out! I was so excited there was one close to where I live and I didn't have to travel to NY. I've been to a couple of escape rooms and I felt this was by far the most challenging yet fun at the same time. We finished with a minute remaining. Great staff, amazing location, and a fun escape room! Can't ask for more."

Gets everyone involved..keeps you on your toes.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  They give you a full hour to find clues and solve problems to ""puzzle out"" of the room. Definitely suggest for a group of friends. The more brain power, the better!  Location was super easy to commute to as it's right outside of the hoboken path train stop. If you're looking for a well put together escape room challenge this is the one to visit!"
"Escape room ""Downtown Countdown"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-downtown-countdown,2,My friends and I had a great time here! The puzzle was just hard enough to be challenging and they helped us out when we needed it. My fiance orchestrated his proposal into the escape room and said that the staff was easy to work with and everything was perfectly executed! Thanks for making this memory so special for us!
