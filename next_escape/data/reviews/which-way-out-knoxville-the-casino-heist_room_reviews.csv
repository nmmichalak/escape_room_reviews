"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by Which Way Out Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/which-way-out-knoxville-the-casino-heist,0,"This was fun and challenging but more of a room with a ton of puzzles. It follows a general theme. There are others that are more fun and realistic. The puzzles don't really go in succession which means there is no ""story"" to follow. We were overbooked with two other groups and had 9 people in the casino one. Way too many for such a tiny room. For the professor one 4 people was good."
