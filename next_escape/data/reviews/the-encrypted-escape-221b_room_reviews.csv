"Escape room ""221B"" by The Encrypted Escape in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/the-encrypted-escape-221b,1,My wife and I did the Sherlock Holmes room and it was very cool. It was awesome to find something we could do for a date night besides going to dinner and a movie. We had a ton of fun and will foe sure be going back to try the other two rooms.

"Escape room ""221B"" by The Encrypted Escape in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/the-encrypted-escape-221b,3,"We have done other escape rooms in the area and they have been nice. We thoroughly enjoyed Encrypted Escape. The Sherlock (Victorian) themed room was a lot of fun. It was full of surprises and unique puzzles. A lot of effort was put into making the scenarios come to life and it shows. We got fully immersed in the setting.The staff was great, especially Cole who ran our scenario. He gave us a sneak peak at the settings of the other rooms and they look just as fun and engaging. We plan to go back."
