"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,0,this escape room is HORRIBLE. I have no idea what game others are playing but let me tell you about it without giving the room away. For starters the clues and puzzles make zero sense. It's supposed to themed as a magicians lair but instead it is filled with gibberish as in made up words and symbols and nothing even remotely related to magic. also there is no roof to the room so it feels like you are playing in a small cubical. you can literally hear what is going on in the room right next you to clear as day also THERE IS NO AC so it was super hot in there as well. also the hints that they give you aren't relevant to what you are trying to do. I regret paying my money to go there so PLEASE BOOK ELSEWHERE

It was quite challenging for just 4 people, but we finished with just under two minutes left! An hour really flies by when your solving multiple puzzles. The puzzles were intricate and entertaining, and force you to pay attention to small details! Owner came in after we finished and she was really sweet, we stayed and talked with her for quite awhile! Glad to help support a local family who genuinely wants their guests to enjoy the game! Will DEFINITELY visit again!"

We had such a blast! Some puzzles were challenging, but the clues they provided were perfect. They didn't give anything away, but guided you if you were stuck. The comments they made were hilarious, too! We absolutely loved it and can't wait for more rooms so we can go back."

Definitely recommend doing as a big group. It was challenging and the puzzles are well organized. We couldn't solve the puzzles, but no disappointment. Overall it was a fun activity. Can't wait to go back and solve another mystery."
