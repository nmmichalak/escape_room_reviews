"Escape room ""Abandoned Basement"" by The Hour Room in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-hour-room-abandoned-basement,0,"First escape room I've ever done and it was excellent! Plenty of different variety of clues and challenges. All of the puzzles and clues were rational and I never felt cheated when they were solved.I was afraid there would be random scary things popping out because I hate haunted mazes, but safe to say even if you hate scary movies you'll be fine here. Would recommend to anyone!"

The story was really well thought out and really fun! My team got out with 13 minutes to spare. The space was really big, much bigger than other escape rooms Iâ€™ve done! I would definitely recommend The Hour Room!"
