"Escape room ""Awakened"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-awakened,0,"The room was good, but would probably be best for first timers. People who are experienced with escape rooms may find it too easy. The props and atmosphere were great and scary, but there wasn't much of a narrative as you went through. Some of the puzzles were innovative and had some cool technology involved, but the final puzzle was a bit simple and made the ending a little anticlimactic. It took us a moment to realize that we were done! I enjoyed that the room was really big, with a lot of smaller rooms that you progressed to. Overall it was a good rioo"

"Escape room ""Awakened"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-awakened,3,Came with a full group of family. Glenn was in charge of leading our group. He was very fun and made us comfortable when we were all nervous. The escape room was not challenging here and there. I loved how it was different rooms and ways to get around. I lost my voice from screaming so much but that's me being a wuss.

Super creepy/eerie theme. It was extremely interactive and witty. Pleasantly surprised that I had enough courage to do it all. Dylan and Glen were super awesome and helpful throughout the entire hour. I would definitely come here again!
