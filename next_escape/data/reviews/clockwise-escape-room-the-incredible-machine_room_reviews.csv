This is definitely in my top 5 of escape rooms in San Francisco.  The room is big enough for lots of people and has tons of puzzles.  I never felt like I had nothing to do.  There are also a few puzzles that I haven't seen anywhere else!Also without any spoilers, the ending has got to be ONE OF THE BEST!  It is such a big payoff for completing the room."
"Escape room ""The Incredible Machine"" by ClockWise Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clockwise-escape-room-the-incredible-machine,2,"Incredible Machine was truly an incredible game! Visited this escape room with 3 of my friends during our trip to SF, we were hooked by the unusual theme and story of the game. Decided to give it a try and didn't regret it! Puzzles were highly interactive and unique, they used some technology that I've never seen before (no spoilers=). Clues and puzzles made sense and were well though out. Heads up, this room uses a lot of audio clues, so make sure to listen carefully. We missed one of them, but our host played the audio clue for us again. And they give unlimited clues! Definitely recommend. "

My husband and I tried this escape room company out based mostly on the high reviews and it 100% lived up to and exceeded our expectations.The rooms are extremely fun, challenging (in a good way) and are created with really high quality fixtures and puzzles that let you truly interact with the environment. The owners are wonderful to deal with and the pride and effort they have put into each room is clearly evident. We had to come back and do the other one it was that great - definitely definitely give this place a go, you won't regret it!"
