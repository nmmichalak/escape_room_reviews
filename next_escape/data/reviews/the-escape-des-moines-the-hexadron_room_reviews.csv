"Escape room ""The Hexadron"" by The Escape • Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/the-escape-des-moines-the-hexadron,0,"Went to do the Informant which was awesome :) First time doing an escape room and had a great time. Kaitlyn was our game host and she was amazing - great energy, great job giving clues. We ended up scheduling another one for a few days later! We did the Hexadron which was also fun and our game host, Nate, was awesome. The rooms are cool and have fun backstories and everyone on the staff we talked to was lovely. Definitely recommend."

I loved the theme (the four of us did the Hexadron room), and the puzzles were the perfect level of challenging! It was so cool to see the different types of puzzles there were. Everything was so creative and engaging. And the staff there was really friendly and enthusiastic! I will definitely be going here again!"

After completing The Psych Ward, we decided to do another and took Josh's advice and did the Hexadron. Both rooms were fun but challenging and Josh was very pleasant and gave us just the right amount of clues. We will definitely be back!"
