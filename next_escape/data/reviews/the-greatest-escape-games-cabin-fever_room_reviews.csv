"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by The Greatest Escape Games in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/the-greatest-escape-games-cabin-fever,0,My group had such a fun time here! We did Cabin Fever and it was a good balance of challenging and fun! Awesome team building activity. Would definitely come back and try the other rooms! Thank you for a great time!

This was the best escape room I've visited! It wasn't enough to keep all of us busy the entire time (there were tasks that only one person could really work on), but we definitely all had fun. The set was really well made, a lot of detail."

Our party of three was paired with another party of three, so we made three new friends, and the six of us together gathered all the clues required to solve the puzzle and free ourselves from the room, with time to spare! Our host did a great job welcoming us, explaining the rules, and complimenting us on our victory! This is a Must-Do when in Colorado Springs! Well done, can't wait to try another room!"

We weren't really sure what to expect when we arrived, but what we encountered definitely exceeded what we were imagining. I will be suggesting this place to family and friends, and would love to come back and challenge myself with another room in the future!"
"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by The Greatest Escape Games in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/the-greatest-escape-games-cabin-fever,4,My family and I just completed (or attempted to complete) the cabin scenario. It was SO much fun! Much harder than expected and our two teenagers figured out many more clues than the adults did. So fun to work together and try to solve the clues! I wish we had more time in town so we could do another room. The gentlemen that helped us seem very passionate about making the whole experience feel authentic which added to the excitement. Would recommend this to anyone who likes to have a blast!
