"Escape room ""Pirate Adventure"" by Limitless Escape Games in Livermore",https://worldofescapes.com/livermore/quests/limitless-escape-games-pirate-adventure,0,We visited Limitless Escapes on Saturday. We have done other escape rooms but this was by far the best experience we have had. We escaped The Pirates Adventure with just seconds to spare. It was challenging and so much fun! The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic. Can't wait to try the next room. Would highly recommend.

We did the Pirate Kraken room. It was 9 of us I believe. We didn't escape but that was lack of communication on the teams part. We only had one final puzzle and we failed. Forever sentenced to Davy Jones locker! The staff was totally patient and helpful, they had fun laughing at us all I am sure. We cannot wait to do it again. Thanks Nathan for putting up with us!"

"Escape room ""Pirate Adventure"" by Limitless Escape Games in Livermore",https://worldofescapes.com/livermore/quests/limitless-escape-games-pirate-adventure,3,Loved this place! I've done over 70 escape rooms and I had an absolute blast here. The staff is incredibly friendly and nice. The puzzles are well thought out and fun. I especially loved the decor of the Pirate themed room and the unique puzzles in their Sherlock themed room. I highly recommend this escape room.
