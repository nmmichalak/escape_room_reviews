"Escape room ""Survival"" by Countdown Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/countdown-louisville-survival,0,"It was so much fun! We did ""Survival"" which was extremely tough and we were not able to escape. But our host was extremely fun and helpful and took the time to explain the steps we couldn't find! Strongly recommend to all ages! The oldest in our group was 75 and our youngest 11! Such blast!"
