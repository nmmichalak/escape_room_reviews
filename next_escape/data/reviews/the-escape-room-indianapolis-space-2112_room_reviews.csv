"Escape room ""Space: 2112"" by The Escape Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-escape-room-indianapolis-space-2112,0,"Space: 2112 is the second room I have played at this location. My wife and I tackled the room with our friends, another couple (it was their first escape room). Overall while the theme of this room is amazing! the puzzles were difficult in an obscure way. I would still recommend the room, but not our favorite."

Everyone was so nice, the facility was spotless clean, and the new Space room we tried escaping was impeccable. It really does make you think all the while having a blast. I highly recommend for date night and fully intend on bringing coworkers for a team exercise!"
