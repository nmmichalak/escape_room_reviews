"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,0,"Fun room! We escaped with money to spare. Having a live actor in the room added a fun twist - he was dressed in period costume, friendly, and we gave him money for clues. Highly recommend!"

"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,2,"This is absolutely unbelievable! This is one of the most sophisticated yet fun and exciting games the proprietors Joy and Jeremy are unbelievably great at what they do. This is an experience that we would recommend for anyone and everyone. We run a level five organization, and we've never seen anything like this. This is a must do for any company or any group.!"
"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,3,"This was our first time doing an escape room, and we loved it. Took three children and they were highly involved. The puzzles were challenging, but doable. We didn't escape with the money, but we really enjoyed ourselves. I would recommend this room."
"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,4,"This is the most amazing room we have done, everything thing about it is so amazing, the fact that you actually have to go old school for this room is what gives it the 5 stars, If I could give a million I would, thank you so much for the fun experience and staying in character the whole time. Definitely will be back for future rooms."
"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,5,"This was a solid escape room. It is a small space, but it was efficiently used. The host stays in the room with you, but it wasn't awkward at all, and he stays in character the whole time which cracked our group up several times. There is a creative hint system where you can get a hint by bribing your host with stacks of cash you find in the room, but that will lower your winnings. Very fun night!"
"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,6,"Great overall experience! Very unique environment you can't find anywhere else! The game master, who is your assistant, has awesome character and diction. The puzzles are so great and unique in its meaning. The game master explained the game afterwards and even makes it more interesting! Definitely recommend to anyone. Kid friendly and gives a great early 1900's vibe."
"Escape room ""Mob Accountant"" by Felix Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/felix-games-mob-accountant,7,"The best escape room I've ever been to. I'm not sure what you're supposed to say about these kinds of things without giving much away, but if you choose to spend your time in this escape room you'll find it well worth it.Rather your average run-of-the-mill employee, those who work in this fine establishment role play the game perfectly and you will sincerely feel like you are in a high-stress, real-life situation rather than just a game.The puzzles were incredibly unique and nothing I had seen before, despite having done several escape games. If you're expecting to play an escape room game with a bunch of locks that ask for word or number combinations, be warned. Your brain will be stretched to the max in this game."
