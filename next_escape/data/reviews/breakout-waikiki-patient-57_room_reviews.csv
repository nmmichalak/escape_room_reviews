"Escape room ""Patient 57"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-patient-57,0,"Went in with my team from work. I've never done anything like this before, wasn't sure what to expect, and thought it would be interested at the least. Let me just say this was the most fun I've had in a very long time. We did Patient 57, which was the easiest (6/10 difficulty). 60 minutes to escape the room. 3 hints available. Unlock everything to get the codes to escape. This was perfect. Difficult enough to get me thinking but not too difficult that we couldn't figure anything out. Basically everything revolves around codes, phones, keys, and combination locks. Everything and anything can be relevant. Almost everything in the room is there for a reason. It's a progression from one code/lock/thing opened to the next until you get the code to leave the room. We finished with 23 seconds left. Unreal. Patient 57 currently has a 33% escape rate."
"Escape room ""Patient 57"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-patient-57,1,"So our staff needed and break from overwhelming work on a daily basis.  We all decided to try out this place to build more workmanship and to test our communication to get away from all this.  We had two groups since their were 14 of us.  We did the Y2K and Patient 57.  Well, it was a really team building.  Everyone help each other to find clues and solve the mission.  It was perfect breakout to show our communication and teamwork as a team.  This place is great place to test your skills and work as a group.  Highly recommend for everyone needing a team building workshop or just for fun.  Great for everybody.  The location we did was in Beachwalk by Lewers.  There is a price per person or group.  The overwhelming from work was a paid off but we were overwhelmed from here.  But in a fun way...... Though none of us breakout.  Sad..."
