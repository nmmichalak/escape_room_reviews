Two were escape room rookies, but everyone did fine. The employee (I forget their name) was really nice and helpful explaining the rules to us. We're planning on going back to try and escape from The Attic."

This was my first escape room experience and I had a really fun time. I think Mafia Heist is a great start for first timers like me!
