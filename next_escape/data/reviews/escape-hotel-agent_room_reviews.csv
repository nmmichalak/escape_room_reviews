"Escape room ""Agent"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-agent,2,"I visited with a group of 4 as a birthday celebration and it was all our first visit to any escape the room experience. We all loved it! When we arrived we were greeted by a hungry zombie, and the ghostly staff was fun and helpful. The Hotel was beautiful and well themed, and our hostess did a great job setting us up for our room. We played Agent, and although we did not win, we had a blast working out the clues and puzzles together. I will definitely be checking back in and plan on filling my passport to Escape Hotel!"
