"Escape room ""Shipwrecked"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-shipwrecked,0,My husband and I took a bunch of 12-year-olds to do the Shipwreck room. It was so much fun! Staff was so helpful and nice. This would be a great team building exercise as long as there is a clear leader. I can't wait to go on a date night and do some other rooms.
"Escape room ""Shipwrecked"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-shipwrecked,1,Codescape has to be tied in first with my escape room experience. Shipwreck is by far their best room and probably the best room in Charlotte. Their other rooms are great as well. I highly recommend them.

It was challenging, fun, and we had the best time. We're all excited to come back!"
"Escape room ""Shipwrecked"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-shipwrecked,3,"We did the Shipwrecked room. The room was full with 10 people (we were put with 8 strangers). I definitely think that was too many people for the room. It was pretty crowded, with several people without anything to really do. I think this room would be better suited for 6 people. That being said, the puzzles were great and the decor fantastic. We finished with about 10 minutes to spare. I would recommend, and I'd love to come back and try another room."

Not our first outing, but this one contains some physical puzzles we had not seen before.  The additional physical aspect really increased the realism of it and the challenge.  My group is planning on revisting Codescape at some point in the future for one of their other rooms."
