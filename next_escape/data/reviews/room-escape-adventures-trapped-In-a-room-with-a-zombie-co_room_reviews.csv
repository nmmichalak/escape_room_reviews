DJ PJ kept our experience ""like totally awesome, dude!"" He also gave help when we needed it most. Definitely a fun room (or maybe I should say basement.)"

At the end, each person gets an assessment of their strengths and what they contributed to the effort. It was a lot of fun. Wear casual clothes and sneakers. It may get warm and as you are escaping the zombie your feet may get stepped on. Lots of fun!"
