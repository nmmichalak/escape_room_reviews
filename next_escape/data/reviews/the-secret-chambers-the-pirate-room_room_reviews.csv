"Escape room ""The Pirate Chamber"" by The Secret Chambers in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-secret-chambers-the-pirate-room,0,"So I just did secret Chambers pirate room. We had a group of 8 ranging from 72 years old to 7 years old. It was amazing. Everyone had fun. The special effects we're great. Walls opening up, canons going off, keys and locks everywhere. We were all so excited. We got out with seconds to spare. Highly recommend."
