"Escape room ""The Doll House"" by A Room with a Clue in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/a-room-with-a-clue-the-doll-house,0,"The Doll House was my favorite of the two rooms we played with this company, but it still had many problems. The theme was great, and one of the best story themes I have ever come across. Yet again, several of the puzzles were really ambiguous and bothered me. There is an audio clue that plays over the loudspeaker, but if you miss the clue, you're out of luck unless the game master replays it.  A puzzle didn't have the suggested input format for it's solution, which left a LOT of room for dumb trial and error. A game player should never have to GUESS the solution to a puzzle.We never did figure the thing out until he told us the correct format and what to do. You'll still have fun at this facility, but be prepared to run into some puzzles that were poorly designed."
