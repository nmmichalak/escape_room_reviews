"Escape room ""The Assignment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Assignment,0,I had so much fun doing the rooms! It's the fastest hour of your life! The rooms are done so cleverly and will leave you talking about them for the weeks after!

Feels pretty intense and we finished with only 57 seconds left. Some very challenging puzzles. Would highly recommend to all ages."
"Escape room ""The Assignment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Assignment,5,12 people was way too many in that chamber. There wasn't enough for everyone to do. Plus we got stuck with another group of 6 and working with strangers was super awkward. It would've been more fun with just my friend group. Not sure I'd go back. Fun to do once.
"Escape room ""The Assignment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Assignment,6,"We were lucky that there were only the 6 of us in the room. The room was designed to hold 10, but that would have been too many. The puzzles were interesting, but we did get stuck too long on some of them. We almost escaped. I would possibly go back and try another room there. My biggest complaint though is that we bought a Groupon and when we got there, we had to pay $10.08 in taxes. No where on our groupon does it state that. We had a Groupon for the escape room in Racine and didn't have to pay anything when we got there."
