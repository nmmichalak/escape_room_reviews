There were 5 of us, with our youngest being a 12-year-old. Didn't make it out but we did have the treasure! We needed to do the last combination but ran out of time. We highly recommend this!"

It was super fun. We worked together and made it out with 58 seconds to spare. It's not easy, so working together is very important, as well as separating and finding other things to contribute to the cause."
