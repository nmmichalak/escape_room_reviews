"Escape room ""Time Travel Trouble"" by Armadillo Escape Room Adventures in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/armadillo-escape-room-adventures-time-travel-trouble,0,This was a really great escape room! The puzzles were challenging yet fun. We had a group of 3 kids and 4 adults and ended up being 1 clue away! The room was really well thought out and made sense. If we had gone in with a plan and slowed down a hair we could have escaped. I highly reccomend this room!

We got stuck in 1922, but I think we would have fixed the time machine if we'd had more than 6 people or maybe 4 more minutes. It was fun, engaging, and close to home. Definitely worth trying!"
