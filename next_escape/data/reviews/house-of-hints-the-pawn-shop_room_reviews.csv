Casey was extremely friendly and gave thoughtful and clever hints without revealing too much. Definitely recommend for any parties/birthday celebrations!"
"Escape room ""The Pawn Shop"" by House of Hints in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/house-of-hints-the-pawn-shop,2,I've never done an escape room before so I was excited to see what this would be like. We did the Pawn Shop setup. It was a lot of fun! We unfortunately did not complete it all in the hour but it was great! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys puzzles.

Kai is the man, he was great and incredibly enthusiastic. I've now done all the rooms and can't wait for them to have some more."
