"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-casino-heist,0,"Had the opportunity to escape from the Casino Heist with a room full of 13 year old. Watched them as they solved each clue to escape just under 60 minutes. Came back to the WLA room of Senator Payne with the family. Had a load of fun. Even Grandma go into the mystery. Can't wait to try one of the new rooms in the Marina area. Also, Angelique was a great hostess as well as the other guy who works there.. "

He surprised me for my birthday, and it was a GREAT surprise. Casino Heist was awesome, and Taylor was such a great gamemaster! I'll definitely be back. "

Did the Casino room this time.....clever! Of course I can't say much, but you'll like. I brought my parents who are in their 80's for their first escape room experience. They totally got into it....and even when they were totally confused, I think they liked being there anyway ;). Luckily 60out has so many rooms..can't wait to try them all!!! "
"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-casino-heist,3,"I HIGHLY recommend their casino room (my 16th one ever)! It's tough, but the hi-tech aspects are impressive! The look and feel makes you feel totally immersed. You have 60 minutes & unlimited hints/clues, but if you want to make the leader board, try not to use one. There were 6 of us in the room. We got out with 5 minutes to spare!I also came back to conquer their Senator Payne room (my 18th one ever) and the puzzles were very unique, which made it so interesting and loads of fun. We had 5 people in that room and we got out in 40 minutes using 1 hint!Can't wait for their next rooms to open up!Street parking free after 8pm. Meter parking $1 per hour. Easy to find parking"

Asides from the well-planned escape room, her service really made our experience a great one. Upon arrival, she greeted us and showed us 2 videos just in case this was our first time and we didn't know what to do. Even when we entered the room, she reviewed the rules once again.My boyfriend and I did the Casino Heist with just 2 people. It was definitely doable! You are allowed an unlimited amount of clues, but we only used one. After we were done, she came in and went over some of the things we missed/had questions about.Initially, I was a little skeptical to try 60out Escape Room since I had a bad experience with a different company in the past and it left a sour taste in my mouth in regards to escape rooms. But Mak and 60out Escape Room really turned my experience around. I can't wait to try out the other ones!! 60out Escape Room is my new ""go-to"" for escape rooms and I highly recommend everyone to check it out."
