Went for our daughters birthday and did the temple room.  We've been to other escape rooms and this was the best one on island. B highly recommend it! Thanks Ron, Kentos, Josh. We'll be back to try the VR room."

Staff was friendly, helpful and enthusiastic which helps the overall experience.  Part of our group did the virtual reality game and the rest of us braved THE TEMPLE...an Indiana Jones meets Goonies theme.  It was a blast!  Our team did manage to get out with 26 minutes to spare...the staff seemed impressed by our speed!  Will definitely recommend to others."

No wait when we first arrived. We played the Temple room and found it to be very fun and challenging, as this was our very first escape room experience. Lily was awesome and super helpful; even extending our time past a little past an hour to finish because we were doing so badly. Would highly recommend to anyone. Definitely down to try the VR options next time."
