"Escape room ""Steampunk Airship"" by Portland Escape Rooms in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/portland-escape-rooms-steampunk-airship,0,"My team and I had a great time on the Steampunk airship with our Captain Nicole and crew member Robert. Nicole was an excellent Captain and although we didn't make it off the ship before it crashed, we gave it our best heave-ho. We were short a few crew members so be sure you go with a good number of crew, 8-10 would be better I should think. We would have liked to have tried our hand at this again, but alas we are in the beyond now...So best of luck to those of you rapscallions eager to save your airship from infinite destruction. Who knows, we may be lucky enough to try again through a haunting or two. And if Captain Nicole is ever in need of a day job she should get in contact with me :)"

The atmosphere, puzzles and props were all spectacularly detailed. Lots of work went into the creation and it shows! Our guides were phenomenal characters. Shout out to the Lieutenant for a spot-on Russian accent. Our captain was hilarious and held everything together. Anyone who enjoys what this company does will certainly enjoy this addition. Very well done!"
