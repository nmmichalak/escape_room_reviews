"Escape room ""King Tut’s Curse"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-king-tuts-curse,0,"After visiting many escape rooms in Charlotte, I can see why Escape Tactic has been voted Charlotte’s #1 escape room! The King Tut room sets the perfect scene for the story with its props and decorations. The puzzles are challenging yet satisfying, and the staff are super welcoming. I will definitely be back to play the rest of their rooms!"
"Escape room ""King Tut’s Curse"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-king-tuts-curse,1,"Just went here as a team building exercise with my company. We all had a blast. My team did the Tut's Tomb room, but the other teams enjoyed it as well. Deciphering the clues to find keys or other clues was a fun challenge. I would like to go back to do another room with my company or on my own. Would highly recommend."

It was amazing, you really get into the game! The King Tutt room was realistic and fun. The room was well thought out, and I loved that you had to solve a series of puzzles and not just escape a room! Our game director, Meghan, was very friendly and helpful. We will most definitely be coming back for more fun and inviting our friends and family to join! - - Thanks for ending our anniversary weekend with a great adventure!!"
