"Escape room ""The Missing Scientist"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/enigma-escape-room-the-missing-scientist,0,"Enigma was great! Knocked out the ""Missing Scientist"" in about 45 mins. We had a group of 4 with only 2 of us ever doing an escape room before, and Mel explained everything really well for the couple of people who had never done an escape room. We needed a couple of hints at first because we stalled in the first room, looking for clues in the wrong places. But I think that's good because then once we got on a roll, we all kind of knew what to look for and did a good job of dividing tasks up between us. Solid first time, will definitely be back to do the ""Facility"" room soon."
"Escape room ""The Missing Scientist"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/enigma-escape-room-the-missing-scientist,1,Our family of four had an outstanding experience working our way out of the room. From the initial excitement of being locked in the room to the many ways the eight of us processed the clues- we were completely engaged and entertained. Can't wait to try the Missing Scientist Part II.
"Escape room ""The Missing Scientist"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/enigma-escape-room-the-missing-scientist,2,I wanted to do something fun with a group of friends for my birthday! We invited our closest friends and had so much fun!!! We came very close but were unable to escape. Our group spent the rest of the evening talking about doing it again somewhere and how much fun we had! I would recommend this for anyone!
