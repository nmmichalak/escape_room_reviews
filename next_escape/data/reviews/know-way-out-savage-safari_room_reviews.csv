"Escape room ""Savage Safari"" by Know Way Out in Petoskey",https://worldofescapes.com/petoskey/quests/know-way-out-savage-safari,0,Great adventure! Our group did the Savage Safari room and it was easy to get lost in the experience! It was challenging and made us think. We got to the third room but didn't get the last few hints. Can't wait to try the other two rooms!

I've done a few rooms before and the Savage Safari was by far my favorite. It was so fun and the atmosphere was awesome. The staff was the sweetest and coming here was the highlight of my weekend trip!"

We did the medium level safari-themed game and finished in 52 min. The clues were very clever, the decor was extremely well done, and it made us feel like we were onsite on safari."
