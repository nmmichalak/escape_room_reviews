"Escape room ""World's Fair Hotel"" by Bangor Escape Rooms in Bangor",https://worldofescapes.com/bangor/quests/bangor-escape-rooms-worlds-fair-hotel,1,"We had such a fun time playing the Worlds Fair Hotel room! The puzzles were clever and rather tricky but made sense as we solved them, and clues were just enough to keep us in the right direction. The theme played really well with this room and we plan on coming back to do the other rooms."
