"Escape room ""Tesla's Dream"" by Enigma Escape Experience in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/enigma-escape-experience-sandy-teslas-dream,0,"Ive done about 6 escape rooms so far, most in the Utah area and one in SF (the world famous Houdini escape room) and by far Teslas Dream is the best escape room I've done in the Utah area so far and I feel it was on par with the Houdini room. Some of the most intricate puzzles and codes I and my group encountered with a fantastic theme and story concept that was more engaging than most rooms. Be warned, Tealas dream is not for novice escape room groups to start with, but I cannot recommend it enough for when you are ready. Certainly check out their other rooms at Enigma for a starting experience.Thanks so much for Tom for hosting me and my group and making a memorable experience for our trip to Utah."
"Escape room ""Tesla's Dream"" by Enigma Escape Experience in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/enigma-escape-experience-sandy-teslas-dream,1,"My daughter was looking for an escape room to do with her friends for her 16th birthday party and we heard about Enigma through our search of local escape rooms. She was looking for one that would not be too frustrating and that would still be fun.She considered Hexed, but decided to do Tesla's Dream, even though it was harder. When we got there, Cameron and Pete welcomed us and briefed is on the story of Tesla and the task. The girls were very nervous for their first escape room experience, but they were game.When they entered, they started solving puzzles and finding keys. I was able to watch them from the monitors and keep an eye on their progress. As the girls got stuck while solving puzzles, Pete and Cameron gave them little hints along the way to keep their confidence up and nudge them in the right direction.The girls ran it of time in the end, but they did not feel bad because they knew it was a difficult room and they made great progress toward escaping and solved many of the puzzles.The girls could not stop talking about the experience all the way home and are planning their next trip to do Hexed.We highly recommend Enigma to anyone from families to large groups."
