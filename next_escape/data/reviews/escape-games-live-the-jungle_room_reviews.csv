He was a great host and answered any questions our group had right away. We did the Jungle escape room and it was awesome! I would highly recommend Escape Games Live for a group event.

It was a lot of fun! We did the Jungle room and Jonathan was there to help us out whenever we needed it. Did we make it out? Yep. In an hour? I'll never tell. I would definitely go back!
