We did ""Psych Ward"" and LOVED it!! Kaitlyn was our game master and made the experience what it was. She was excitable, encouraging, funny, and kind! We are already planning our next trip back (and requesting Kaitlyn :))!"

This definitely did not disappoint. The staff were super nice, passionate, and helpful. The escape room (Psych Ward) was fun, challenging, and very intense. I can't wait to go back and try out the other rooms. Will definitely spread the word!"

My kids and I have done several escape rooms and we loved this one. We did the Psych Ward. I like that the clues are unlimited, but they are subtle and still make you think. The room had many different kibds of clues, some twists and some head scratchers. The guys working there were so much fun! They helped make the experience great! I would definitely recommend The Escape!"

The place is very nice, the owner was fantastic and the room was so fun. It is a bit different than thd other escape rooms we have done, but that was a welcome change. We did the Psych Ward and escaped with 2 minutes left. It was visually appealing and the storyline and clues were diverse. Our favorite part was that any clues that are given are typed on the screen. That's helpful so you can re-read as much as you need to help complete that clue. We cant wait to try out the other room and more in the future!!"

My family and I recently experienced The Psych Ward and escaped with 1:25 left! The employees had great personalities and ensured enjoyment for all. You can request more clues than normal, or you can request they give you little to no clues, which was awesome because we wanted to figure out as much as we could without assistance. Our guide was really helpful throughout the game and was even waiting at the door to congratulate us! Overall, I was very satisfied with the thought and time put into the room. We were all very satisfied with the customer service. Very excited to try the other room!"
