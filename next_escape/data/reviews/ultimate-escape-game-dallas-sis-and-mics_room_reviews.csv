"Escape room ""Earthquake"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-sis-and-mics,0,Celebrated my daughter's 18th birthday here. Great decision! It was our first time in an escape room and it far surpassed our expectations. We had 7 people in our group and we needed all of our brains to make it out in the nick of time! So much fun! I highly recommend it to anyone and we will most certainly be back!

We intended on doing 2 rooms during our friends outing... and ended up doing 3 - they are that good and that fun.First we did the Time Collector - and all of the geeky elements put into this game are a nerd's (my) dream. On top of the fact that the puzzles were very well put together and each room was incorporated in the puzzles more than once - and that's true of all of their games that we played. We beat this (their ""easiest"" room with 7:58 left). The second game we did was Fallout, which was their second hardest room, and it didn't disappoint. Very solid in terms of puzzles, types of puzzles and tech, and layout (very unique). We beat this one with 10:58 left. We were done with the bookings that we made ahead of time, then decided to see if we could do one more. We opted for Si's and Mic's (which we read as See's and Mike's, but it's Sy's and Mick's - like Seismic's - like and earthquake - and that turned out to be awesome as well. This one has some unique puzzles, layout, and tech. We beat this one was just over 12:00 to go. I cannot say enough great things about this place. From the quality of puzzles, to the friendliness of the staff, this place is perfect."
