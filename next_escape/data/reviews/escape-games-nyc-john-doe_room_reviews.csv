"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,0,"In our group of 6, half were experienced, half were first timers. We chose John Doe because of the unique theme, despite the high difficulty rating. Definitely creeped out by the dim lighting (your smartphone flashlight is a must), background music and creepy props. We did use all 3 clues, and escaped with 9 minutes to spare. A good challenge, for sure. And Adam was a great host. Highly recommend this business and this room. "
"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,1,"Staff very enthusiastic about escape games and very professional. I highly recommend this company for the staff and design of their rooms. I would recommend John Doe room. This might be a bit harder than the Detective Story room. It is a mix of traditional and modern puzzles. It is is a wonderfully themed room with well theme puzzles with an overarching mission. My wife and I failed the John Doe room, but it remains a favorite and should be very doable with a team of three or four. "
"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,2,"My friend booked this room for 6 of us. None of us had any prior experience, and apparently this is their most difficult room. After asking for 3 clues, we literally made it out in 59 min 45 seconds! It was a blast! Can't wait to try other rooms."

"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,4,Our very first experience and it was exciting as never and entertaining for everyone. Beats sitting at the bar drinking. A new era of adult entertainment. We will be back with a bigger group.
"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,5,"I would definitely check this venue out if you have a small group and don't want to play with strangers. My group of 4 picked the ""John Doe"" room, which I definitely recommend. It's their newest and hardest room, complete with sound effects. Not as scary as the website/game master makes it seem (though I suppose this depends on your tolerance of creepy). It's very different from other Escape the Rooms, so don't worry if you have prior experience - it'll still be challenging."
"Escape room ""John Doe"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-john-doe,6,"My group of friends and I came here today to solve the ""John doe"" room and we had so much fun! None of us had any previous experience or done any escape the room before and this is apparently the hardest one they have, yikes!!! Luckily we escaped in 57 minutes with the help of 3 clues. Every item was well thought out and when you thought you were done, another door opens up with more surprises! The room does get hot though since you are with a couple of others in the room and are frantically looking to get out in the allotted time so don't wear too many layers! Also be patient with certain items in the room, they do work! Oh yea, your picture can only be hanging if you can escape without any clues so refrain if you have some time!"

Did the ""John Doe"" room and while my team didn't succeed, we had a great time. It was very creative and so much fun. We will go again soon!"
