"Escape room ""Aftermath"" by Exit Plan in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/exit-plan-aftermath,1,We loved it from beginning to end. We did the aftermath we did not think it would take is the entire time but it did. We actually failed in the last room. Will definitely do again.
"Escape room ""Aftermath"" by Exit Plan in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/exit-plan-aftermath,2,"We've done two rooms here now, S3RIAL and Aftermath. Having done over 10+ rooms total at 7 different locations between Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania Exit Plan very well may be the best we've done as a whole. Both rooms were absolutely spectacular. The attention to detail is incredible. The puzzles are intricate and just the right difficulty level. The staff have all been informative and kind. Every time we've been they have been extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an overall excellent escape room experience."
