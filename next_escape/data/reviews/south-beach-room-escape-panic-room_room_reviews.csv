"Escape room ""Panic Room"" by South Beach Room Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/south-beach-room-escape-panic-room,4,"Honestly, this place is amazing. If you like to use your mind or just want a generally interesting time, you can't beat it. Basically you get locked in a puzzle, similar to Saw (the movies), but without any scares. There are clues hidden all around to help you open the numerous locks, trap doors, and boxes hidden about the rooms. Each puzzle has a goal and I can't wait to get back here and try another room. This is also a really good team building activity as these clues often require more than one person. The only hint I can give you is be observant, from the time you call to book your slot, until you successfully break out of the room ;)What are you waiting for go check these guys out! Oh and by the way, they make you delicious cocktails afterwards for free... Seriously for less than 30 bucks get on it!"

Try this place out! Group of 9 friends came late on a Saturday attempting to do something fun and new. Half our party have done escapes before, so we were pro's, but the rest a bunch of rooks.The way this works is you get locked in a room, and you scour every nook and cranny for clues to unlock locks and solve puzzles, until you bust your way straight outta Compton. (You gently unlock the final door).We did the panic room. We owned that ish. Well at first we did, but we got stuck at the end and barely got out in time.  This particular escape place is not scary, but still keeps you on your toes and your heart racing towards the end.Overall, it was a lot of fun and we had a great time. After we escaped we left and celebrated with dinner and clubbing!"

Had the best time. We did the panic room and though we didn't complete it, (came extremely close), the experience was fun and exciting. Basically you get locked inside a room and have to find tools and keys and clues to help get you out within 60 minutes. It's interesting and brain teasing and all in all a fun way to work together w your friends. For only 20-30$, and they offer free cocktails, you can not beat this experience. We will be booking again for a future visit and can't wait to try the other rooms available. I recommend this place for everyone to try at least once!!"
