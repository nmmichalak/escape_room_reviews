"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Dare 2 Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/dare-2-escape-the-dig,0,Took my mother to experience her first escape room as I have done it before. This one far surpassed my expectations. We did the Dig and it was very immersive and set design was top notch for the value we paid. Challenges were creative. Even the two people we didn't know who joined us in the room had a blast. I think what set the bar is the friendliness of the game master. Will be back for the other two rooms!
