"Escape room ""Murder at Saloon #10"" by Black Hills Escape Rooms in Rapid City",https://worldofescapes.com/rapid-city/quests/black-hills-escape-rooms-murder-at-saloon-10,0,"We had 9 people in Saloon #10 with ages ranging from 8 months old to 64 years old! It was really cool, a good time was had by all and we escaped the room with 1 minute to spare of the 60 with no hints! The baby was fascinated by the items we were finding :)The price per head for these challenges is very reasonable, we were surprised. This is a unique experience and we are definitely planning to try the other rooms and bring along more friends to join in. Great job guys!"
