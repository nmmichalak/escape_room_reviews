We escaped in 49:39 mins.  A must try!  We want to come back and do another!  Otto did a good job providing us clues when we asked! Notes: clean bathrooms, team locker to store your costs and things, easy sign, street parking no charge, great overall experience!"
"Escape room ""The Bank Job"" by Seattle Escape Games in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/seattle-ecsape-games-the-bank-job,1,Recently went with a bunch of friends and we had an absolute awesome time. What I loved most about the Bank Robbery was that it created team work. No one person was Dominate it literally took the whole team to make it out without getting captured. It really gets one to open their minds to think out side the box..Even though we did get captured it was a freaking blast. Definitely want to go and experience the other escape rooms.
