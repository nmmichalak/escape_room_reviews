"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,0,"Would recommend if you have kids or novice players. Avoid if you have escape room connoisseurs. 5/5 for room design - it sets the mood for a break in. 1/5 puzzle difficulty - most of the puzzles were ultra easy to figure out. I could be that I'm a little more experienced and should have opted for a more challenging room. (We were out in less than 20 minutes, so understandably, I didn't feel like we received our money's worth). "
"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,1,Nice backstory and immersive room. A mix of modern and unique traditional puzzles that fit the theme nicely. Good room for newbies. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the booking process. The game master was tracking our progress carefully and gave hints promptly.
"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,2,Escaped the Theft room with my family on 5-14-17 (with 3 seconds to spare). We had an absolute blast! The escape room was challenging (which is the point) and so well created. The staff was fantastic. It was a thoroughly enjoyable time. We will definitely be back to conquer another room.

Thinking seriously about doing it again in another room. Definitely recommend it.

I've already convinced my closest friends to try it out!"
"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,5,We had a great time doing the Thief room but got stuck a few times. We did end up figuring it out in the end and beating the time but only with a lot of help. Overall it was a great experience but the North Valley Escape Room in Anthem is so far the best we've been too.
