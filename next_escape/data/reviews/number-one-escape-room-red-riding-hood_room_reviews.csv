"Escape room ""Red Riding Hood"" by Number One Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/number-one-escape-room-red-riding-hood,2,"I'll start off by saying I'm not the most experienced when it comes to escape rooms. So much so that I didn't even realize the entrance itself was a puzzle. But thankfully the great staff realized my lack of skill and saved the day!I joined some friends for Robin Hood and was thoroughly impressed. I felt like every puzzle was difficult but had some sort of clues to help out, and each one left you satisfied. They take a different approach to clues than Ive experienced by giving written riddles when asked, adding to the fun.Definitely worth checking out, and I plan on going back again for more!"
