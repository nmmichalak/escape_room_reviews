"Escape room ""Portlandia"" by Escape Games PDX in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escape-games-pdx-portlandia,0,"We played the portlandia game.  I’ve been wanting to play this game for a long time and it’s always booked up so I was beyond thrilled when I was able to make a reservation for 6.  The props are amazing and it seems like a good game.  Our experience however was ruined by another player that was in the room, he was not part of our group of 6.  He bulldozed all of us, if we found a clue he grabbed it out of our hands, if we were standing there trying to figure something out he told us in no uncertain terms that “that puzzle has already been solved it’s time for you to move on”.   My group and I spent the last 40 minutes of the game just leaning on furniture  and rolling our eyes at each other because it was apparently a one man show.  This doesn’t reflect negatively on the business, like I said I’m sure it’s a good game, I just wouldn’t know.  Basically my group forked our 180.00 to watch some guy play the game (with no help from his friends either).  I guess in order to avoid this I’ll just have to book the entire room, which probably won’t happen because I’m not spending 300.00 just to make sure I don’t get railroaded."

Portlandia is a great room for friends out having a good time, and Sherlock is perfect for someone who really wants to solve some puzzles and use their critical thinking chops! Highly recommend this to everyone."
