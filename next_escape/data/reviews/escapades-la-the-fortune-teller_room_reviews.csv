"Escape room ""The Fortune Teller"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-fortune-teller,0,"A friend of mine really wanted to try The Fortune Teller Room. I've done plenty of escapes rooms and immersive experiences over the last couple years, The Fortune Teller Room was definitely a breath of fresh air. I don't want to spoil too much, but the room was unique in terms of how puzzles and challenges are presented. Everyone had an opportunity to participate. The theme and story of room were spot on and immersive. No random items that feel out of place like directional locks or number locks. There room is challenging in a fun and clever way. If you have done escape rooms before, definitely check this one out with your escape group for a different type of escape room experience."
"Escape room ""The Fortune Teller"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-fortune-teller,1,"""The Fortune Teller beckons you with a neon sign that reads free group readings.  Mistress Nova welcomed us from behind her velvet to get our tarot card reading.  The signs aren't good.  A mystery with dire consequences is a foot.""What is in store is a fun, creepy, camp experience that was exceptionally executed in production with fun lighting, a playful background music, and delightful acting. The games were a lot of mini puzzles with a timed element like any good escape room but broken up with interaction with Mistress Nova to further the story.  The immersive aspect of the room was really amped up having to talk to our fortune teller.If you've been here before, you'll know that this is the same space that was used as the Disrupted Decades room but they've done a phenomenal job making the room its own experience that I couldn't tell at all what the room was before.Great job Level Games team!"
"Escape room ""The Fortune Teller"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-fortune-teller,2,"Paid a wonderful visit to the new Fortune Teller room at Level Games. The fortune teller herself is more of a mediator than a medium. She will guide you through the narrative and provide some hints along the way.The room has great atmosphere. It is like an old penny arcade that has a variety of delightful challenges requiring problem and puzzle solving, dexterity, and creativity. Teamwork was encouraged and rewarded by our live Zoltar.We had a group of 3 and found that there was plenty for each person to do. They recommend 4 people for this max of 5 room. As the cards are dealt, the game design definitely benefits a group of 4.I can see great success for this room and continued success for Level Games in the future. The care and enthusiasm in the creation of this room is truly evident and incorporates all aspects that make an immersive/escape experience unforgettable."
