"Escape room ""Cinema"" by Lakeland Escape Room in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/lakeland-escape-room-the-cinema,0,We had four rooms filled with people and my group is the only one that escaped. The staff was very nice and treated our group of 25 very professionally. We escaped the cinema room with 18 minutes and one clue left to go. Sat outside and kept waiting on the others groups to escape. This was a fun adventure to do in Lakeland.

My friends and I did the Cinema escape room. Although we didn't escape, we had a blast trying. The staff was extremely nice. I'll definitely be returning."

What a wonderful time! The attention to detail was amazing! The staff are all well trained and very helpful. This family-owned business treats their customers with much appreciation. They developed their own rooms, clues and storylines so you will not find these rooms anywhere else! Great job Lakeland Escape Room!"
