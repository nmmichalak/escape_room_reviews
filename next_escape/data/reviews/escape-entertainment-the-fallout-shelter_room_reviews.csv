"Escape room ""The Fallout Shelter"" by Escape! Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-entertainment-the-fallout-shelter,0,"We had a blast at Escape on Francis in the Fallout Shelter. It was four 13 year olds, a 10 year old and me. Personnel were excellent too. Fun had by all. We will definitely be back!"

This time we tried the Fallout Shelter. Once again we failed to escape in time, but we were oh so close! We just needed one more number. Probably would have figured it out if we had a few more minutes. It was a lot of fun. Shea was awesome and made it a great experience. Can't wait to try again!"
"Escape room ""The Fallout Shelter"" by Escape! Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-entertainment-the-fallout-shelter,2,So much fun! I really love that they let children come as we don't have a babysitter on standby. We did the Fallout Shelter. They had toys in it and my daughter had fun exploring the room while we solved the clues. We went with my brother in law who was in town and had a blast. We escaped with 9 minutes to spare! Already deciding which one to do next!
