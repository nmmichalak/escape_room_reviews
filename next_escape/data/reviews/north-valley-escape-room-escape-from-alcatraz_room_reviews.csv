Each of these rooms are a must do. We waited patiently for Escape from Alcatraz and it amazed us with its absolute spot on decor right down to the color of the walls. The flow of the puzzles were great. Room is challenging but we managed to escape with time to spare. If you're in north Phoenix, just head 15 minutes further north as this was awesome! Highly recommended! We have done 42 escape rooms in AZ and this room takes the cake so far! Great Job Team North Valley Escape Room!"
"Escape room ""Escape from Alcatraz"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-escape-from-alcatraz,3,The staff were so friendly and helpful with all of the questions we asked. Our group did the Escape from Alcatraz. The rooms are very elaborate and the puzzles were well done. We were so close to getting out but time ended just as we were on the very last puzzle. Our group was made up of mostly first timers to escape rooms. I highly recommend for any skill level. We will definitely be back to try their two other rooms.

The room was so much more elaborate and complicated than I ever imagined. Our family (two parents, three kids(17, 17, 15), and two grand parents) had so much fun working together to solve the puzzle and find our way out! We loved all the little surprises along the way too. I must commend your staff of puzzle makers and builders for really creating an immersive experience filled with intrigue and danger, it was perfect!The kids are already asking when we can go back!"
