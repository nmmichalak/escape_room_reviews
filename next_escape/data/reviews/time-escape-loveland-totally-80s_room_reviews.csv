"Escape room ""Totally 80’s"" by Time Escape Loveland in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/time-escape-loveland-totally-80s,1,"We did the 80's room. We had 4 adults and 5 kids in the room. We were able to find the Bad tickets and open the door with less than a minute left. It was a lot of fun for our whole family, including the kids."
"Escape room ""Totally 80’s"" by Time Escape Loveland in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/time-escape-loveland-totally-80s,2,We just had the pleasure of playing the 80's room at Time Escape and WOW! We have played nearly every escape room in northern Co and were blown away with the entire experience. They built out a beautiful classic property in downtown Loveland and filled it with challenging and very well thought out games and an awesome staff! We were laughing and having fun with the 80's memorabilia and rocking out with authentic music and props! Rob and Krista are awesome and run one of the very best Rooms around! 10 stars!
"Escape room ""Totally 80’s"" by Time Escape Loveland in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/time-escape-loveland-totally-80s,3,"Time Escape Loveland is Ah-Mazing! We were treated so kindly at the door and everything was perfectly explained! Our experience in the 80's Escape Room was a blast! When you walk in the door, it's like stepping into your high school bedroom with all things '80s that you can imagine!! The riddles and clues kept us on our toes right to the very end...but we escaped with 4 minutes left!! We'll be back!!!A big shout out to Miss Hadley, our hostess! She was a hoot and very helpful & accommodating!! We loved her as much as our first Escape Room experience!!Time Escape is a great addition to the Loveland Community and definitely worth your time!!"
