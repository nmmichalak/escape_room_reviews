"Escape room ""Diamond Heist"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-th-heist,0,Our family of 5 plus a few friends went yesterday for our daughter's 17th birthday. We attempted the Diamond Heist. We didn't make it out and got busted by the cops but we had an amazing time. We will definitely be visiting again soon! The room was awesome and it had puzzles that everyone in the group was able to solve right down to our 10 year old son.

We ran out of time but got pretty close. And everyone in the family contributed. This St. Louis location is just a few blocks from Gateway Arch. We would come back.Forgot to mention, the staff was super friendly."

The heist room was more enjoyable in my opinion but all in all a great experience and one I would definitely recommend to others. Look forward to the rooms that are being added.
