Did we find it at Auburn Escape Zones! It was fun, entertaining and full of laughs! Great family evening or team event! The staff really tried to make it enjoyable for us! If we are ever in Auburn again, we will be back!!!"
"Escape room ""The Puzzler vs Superheroes"" by Auburn Escape Zones in Auburn",https://worldofescapes.com/auburn/quests/auburn-escape-zones-the-puzzler-vs-superheroes,1,"We've completed Imprisoned, The Cabin and the Superheroes vs Puzzler escape rooms and have had so much fun with each one. Imprisoned was our favorite, Superheroes was a close 2nd. Can't wait for the next theme! We've been twice with our Girl Scout Troop and once has a family. Fun, great way to work on communication and teamwork. I highly recommend Auburn Escape Zones. Well worth the trip (we drive 45 minutes to visit). The staff is friendly and courteous."

We did the Cabin Room first and last week we tried out the Super Hero Room. Both are very challenging but very fun. I highly recommend you to check out this cool place!
