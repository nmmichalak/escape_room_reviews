"Escape room ""Escape from Summer Vacation"" by School of Hard Locks in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/school-of-hard-locks-summer-vacation,0,There were 6 of us and we had the room to ourselves. We did Summer Vacation. It was very close but we escaped! I thought it was well thought out and put together. I've only done a few of these so I'm not world worthy but we had a GREAT girls night out. The staff were very friendly (and funny!) and added to our night.

There were 4 of us who had never been in an escape room doing the Summer Vacation level 7 difficulty. Get your thinking caps on and think outside the box! The staff was accommodating with our time and very friendly! Would definitely recommend!

Working as a team brings you closer together as friends and I admire the skills of all my friends and new friends. Definitely a positive experience. Owner and mastermind behind it all was so cordial and fun. You can tell this is her passion and her enthusiasm puts the icing on the cake! Thank you!
