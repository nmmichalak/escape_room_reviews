"Escape room ""Amazon Rainforest"" by International Room Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-amazon-rainforest,0,"This was an amazing experience! My wife and I happened to walk by it and she said jokingly ""want to do an escape room?"". Without hesitation I said yes and in we went. It is by far the most decorated escape room we've seen to date. The two hosts were incredibly friendly. We choose the amazon plane crash room. The decoration and the detail were incredible! It was mildly difficult. My wife and I completed it with 10 minutes to spare. We can't wait to try the other one!! You will not Be disappointed with this escape room! Well done!"

You can definitely tell that a lot of work went into it to make it as immersive as possible. Please take note though that I played with 2 other people and some of the puzzles would be easier to achieve with 1 or maybe two more people. Also attention to detail is needed for this room as it is easy to miss items you are needing to find in order to do some of the puzzles. Our game master Aly was fun and refreshingly enthusiastic! Thank you for the fun experience!"
"Escape room ""Amazon Rainforest"" by International Room Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-amazon-rainforest,2,"*I am an internationally experienced Escape Room enthusiast with hundreds of rooms under my belt*These wonderful owners have created some beautiful rooms here. They are quite deserving of their High Production Value/Immersive award that they won for their Amazon Rainforest room. From start to finish, that room was one of my all-time favorites. So much attention to detail and overall fun. And the price is even lower than other Escape Rooms. Their Gravitational Effect room was a step-down in puzzle quality, though the interior design was still above-average. I especially enjoyed the physical dynamic in the middle room. Gift shops usually put me off, but in the lobby you can buy beautiful flowers hand-made by the owner. It was a nice touch.Games played: Amazon Rainforest, Gravitational Effect"
