It was really cool! The store was amazing, too, with tons of brain teasers, puzzles, and games! It was a blast and I can't wait to come back and do another room!"

Unfortunately, we let Jesse James down... First by robbing the bank before he got back in town, and second, by not escaping in time. The crew was awesome and there are puzzles for purchase as well as sharpening your skills while waiting for your escape. A fun time!"

The hour we were in the Jesse James Room flew by. The room was well put together and the clues were wonderfully difficult. Although we didn't escape, we will be coming back again and again! Our game master was friendly and made the experience all the more enjoyable. Thank you Conundrum Escape Rooms!!"
