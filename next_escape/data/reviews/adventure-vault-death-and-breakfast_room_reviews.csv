It was our 2nd escape room adventure and we were not disappointed! We chose the Death and Breakfast but will definitely be back for the apparently more challenging Prison Break.Whether you're an amateur or a novice, you won't be disappointed! Tamara and Daniel took really good care of us! And it helps that they are avid participants in these games as well!"
"Escape room ""Death and Breakfast"" by Adventure Vault in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/adventure-vault-death-and-breakfast,1,"This escape room is awesome! It is owned by two brothers who plan all of the escape rooms by themselves. It is not a bought room, rather made by the minds of the brothers. My group escaped the Death & Breakfast room. It was very fun, yet challenging! We've only done a few escape rooms before, but this one was definitely at the top of the list! A must go for any escape room fanatics, company outings, or first timers!"

"Escape room ""Death and Breakfast"" by Adventure Vault in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/adventure-vault-death-and-breakfast,4,The Death & Breakfast room was challenging without being overly difficult. We had 4 in our group and really had a good experience. We are planning on going to the Prison Redemption room very soon to try it. The Staff is exceptionally helpful and we all had great conversation afterwards. Definitely go check the Adventure Vault out for a fun activity. Thanks Daniel for a wonderful night.
