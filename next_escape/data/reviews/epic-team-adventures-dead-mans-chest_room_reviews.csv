"Escape room ""Dead Man's Chest"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-dead-mans-chest,0,"Went with our family we did the Davey Jones treasure chest one. The hour flew by, super fun- definitely makes you think as it's all based around mind puzzles. Very helpful staff, could see when we needed help and stepped in with direction. Highly recommend!!!"
"Escape room ""Dead Man's Chest"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-dead-mans-chest,1,"If you like challenging escape rooms, Epic Team Adventures is a place to check out. It is located in an office building and can be a little difficult to find.We did the Pirate Adventure which is designed for larger groups. It is difficult to write too much of a review without giving too much away.I think this is probably better with groups of friends, but OK to do alone. It is definitely worth a visit."

I believe the puzzle quality is great, the production is amazing and it was a really good time each time."
