"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-meltdown,0,"This was my first escape room and I was nervous because I had no idea what to expect. It turned out to be one of the most exciting, engaging and entertaining experiences I’ve ever had in the city. The person I was with is an escape room veteran, and he said afterwards that “The Meltdown” was by far the best designed room he had been in. I will definitely be back again."

There were four of us, and we were grouped with a trio. Compared to other escape the rooms, it didn't look quite as exciting inside - I've seen more ""cool"" or shocking rooms/puzzles. That being said, it was super fun, and it's always better when you make it out in time ;)"
