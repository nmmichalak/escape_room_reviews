"Escape room ""Stealing Mona"" by IQ Escape in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/iq-escape-stealing-mona,0,"Completed ""Stealing Mona"" and was the first time I've ever done an escape room. It was surprisingly more fun than I had expected and the rooms were very well done, effects, music and all. The guy who took care of us was really cool too. Definitely coming back."
"Escape room ""Stealing Mona"" by IQ Escape in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/iq-escape-stealing-mona,1,I had a great time stealing Mona. It was challenging even for our group that has done a lot of other escape rooms. There were a variety of puzzles and we had to try many things to figure it all out. The staff was just helpful enough and they were fun to chat with after we finished. Definitely with the money!

Stealing Mona was a great experience. Jason was personable and professional; I would recommend this to anyone considering an outside-the-box team building activity!
