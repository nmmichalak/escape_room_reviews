Awesome place to go do something fun with your date or friends. Can't wait for the new room to open!"
"Escape room ""Pipe Works"" by Puzzle Effect Gilbert in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-escape-room-gilbert-pipe-works,2,The Phoenix Escape Room has been remodeled and games improved significantly over the past 6 months. The first thing we noticed was how clean the facility is (it even smells good). We played the Pipes game and it was both challenging and a lot of fun. It's now one of the best escape rooms in the valley and highly recommend.

Very challenging and well done. We did the Pipeworks Room. I highly recommend and will definitely go back and try another room.As a side note, if you are over 40 make sure you bring your reading glasses. There are a lot of tiny numbers on combination locks. I forgot mine but luckily I had some younger people in my group who could see!"

We had a blast! I can't wait to do this with a group of adults. It was really challenging and exciting as we figured out clues. We can't wait to go again. The room was so authentic looking! Pipe works was def worth the hour...which flew by.
