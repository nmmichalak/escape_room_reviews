"Escape room ""The Bomb"" by MindQuest Escape Games in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/mindquest-escape-games-jupiter-the-bomb,0,"I've done around 60 escape rooms, most of which in the south Florida area, and this one was up there with the best, regardless of your experience with escape rooms.While not taking advantage of a ton of technology in ""The Bomb"" room, the puzzles and theming were done very well. When rating escape rooms, I look for specific characteristics such as difficult and unique puzzles, good theming, a good story, etc. Mindquest's bomb room met all of those expectations.As I have done many escape rooms, it's important to reiterate that I believe this room to be good for people with all types of experience in escape rooms. Whether it's your first or your sixtieth, you'll still enjoy this room."

There was 6 of us and we can't wait to go back and try another room.  We got out with 1.5 minutes to spare....  A good time was had by all.

We had such a great time that we ended up playing a second game. We played both Diamond Heist and The Bomb. Both games were exciting and challenging enough. Canâ€™t wait to go back again. I highly recommend trying out your luck to see if you can escape!
