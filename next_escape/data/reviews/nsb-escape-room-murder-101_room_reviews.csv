First off, as a local, I am always on the hunt for new and different things to do around the area - and this is one of a kind! There's a few rooms, and we (8 of us) did Murder 101. It was challenging and fun at the same time especially when you solve a puzzle or find a clue. This was memorable and I will definitely be back to escape the other rooms!"
