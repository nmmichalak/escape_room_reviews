"Escape room ""Alpha Lab"" by Escape Brigade in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-brigade-alpha-lab,0,"Kinda hard to find, it's in an office building in the basement. Not really any signage anywhere, could be the building doesn't allow it though. First impression wasn't great, there's a sheet hiding something, maybe tv screens? But kinda awkward nonetheless.However, once in the escape room the puzzles were difficult and decorated pretty well. Did the science room. First time in an escape room and was pleasantly surprised that the first impression didn't hold true. Finished with 2 minutes to spare!Wish there were signs/props to hold for a photo op after that said ""we escaped"" or whatever that I've seen pictures of for other escape rooms."
"Escape room ""Alpha Lab"" by Escape Brigade in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-brigade-alpha-lab,1,We went last night with a group of four. Escape Brigade is located in a convenient location with plenty of parking so finding it wasn't as issue. The Lab room is like playing a real life video game. The staff is highly engaging and created a very memorable experience. I would recommend having 4-8 people working on completing the room as the puzzles could be challenging and teamwork plays a large role of getting out of the room on time. The story line and the puzzles are very well developed and engaging with the right amount of challenge and clues. This is something I would do again as soon as they complete their second room. This is my third escape room and by far the best! Can't wait to come back!
