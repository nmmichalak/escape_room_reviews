"Escape room ""The Meltdown"" by Clever Clues Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/clever-clues-escape-room-the-meltdown,0,"First escape room that I've been to and it was a blast! Everyone had a great time. We did the more difficult ""Meltdown"" room and there were several puzzles that required us to divide-and-conquer. It was also nice that they had an employee in the room with us to give little hints here and there. The hints were not dead giveaways either, just a little push in the right direction. I'd definitely come back to try the other room."
