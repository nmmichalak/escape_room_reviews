It was ABOVE our expectations! 100% we would definitely, absolutely go back! Hailey was amazing and to hear the story behind the making of this room made us appreciate it that much more. It added a personal touch. Thank you for making our first escape room a memorable experience!"
"Escape room ""The Oval Office"" by Houdini's Room Escape in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/houdinis-room-escape-the-oval-office,3,This was our first time at Houdini's Room Escape and I cannot speak highly enough about the experience. We had a group of 8 and escaped from the Oval Office room. Half of our group had completed escape rooms before and half were first-timers. The room was challenging and well put together. Our host was incredibly friendly and made the experience even better. Would definitely come back to support this family-owned business!

This was the most impressively put together room we've encountered! The amount of work they put into this room is amazing! We will be back to try out their other rooms! Shout out to Sarah, our game guide! Houdini's raises the bar and the customer service is outstanding."
