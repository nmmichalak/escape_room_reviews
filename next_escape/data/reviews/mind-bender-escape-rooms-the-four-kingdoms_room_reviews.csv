"Escape room ""The Four Kingdoms"" by Mind Bender Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/mind-bender-escape-rooms-the-four-kingdoms,0,We had an awesome time at Mind Bender for a friends night out. We did the Four Kingdoms Room which is like a Game of Thrones theme. The puzzles were difficult but well thought out. The props and decor were awesome and they pay great attention to detail. We didn’t make it out in time but want to go back and try again. This would be awesome for a team building event or group work outing. You really need to work together to help solve the puzzles. We can’t wait to go back!

The room was spot on with decorations for a Kingdom theme. Room was considered a 7.6 our of 10 difficulty and I can see why. The boys enjoyed this room so much, they plan on doing an Escape Room once a quarter. Our room host was great. His hints were just what the boys needed. You can have 3 hints. Rooms are clean and well maintained. You won't be disappointed."

The rooms were fantastic. We did the Jewel Heist and the Four Kingdoms. They were both awesome, with puzzles beyond the simple solve-this-symbol-combo type. They were interactive, with videos, word games, and more! The themes we're also awesome. We really got into the mood with the intro videos. Not only were the rooms themselves fun, but the staff was amazing. We had a split group because of some mis- communication, and the staff (and really nice fellow players) let us change rooms to all be together. This is absolutely the best escape room in Jacksonville for families. Thank you so much for an awesome experience!"
