"Escape room ""Mad Hatter's Tea Party"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-mad-hatters-tea-party,0,"This was my first escape room. There were 10 of us in total, which made it a little too crowded. We made it out with 14 minutes to spare, so I'd suggest fewer people. It was definitely a good first room, and I enjoyed all the puzzles!"

The room monitor did an excellent job of not helping too much and gave clues when we needed them that still kept it challenging for the girls.....not too easy, but not too hard! Great experience for them! "

Great, friendly staff. Mad Hatter's Tea Room was an excellent challenge. We had a group of 8 and managed to get out with some time remaining. I've been to other escape rooms and this is my favorite so far. They pay attention to detail, not just in the room but the overall company. I will most certainly return and try out their other rooms. Highly recommend."
