"Escape room ""Taken"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/The-Escape-Room-Taken,0,We went to Red Door Escape Room with a group of friends and family to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had a blast! This was our first time to do an escape room and we challenged ourselves with Taken. Our group was split into two and we had to use clues from our room to solve the other room's puzzles and vice versa. Our game master was so kind and helpful. We got through everything but the last clue and are really ready to try again. I definitely recommend this place!
"Escape room ""Taken"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/The-Escape-Room-Taken,1,So much fun. Our room Taken was split in two groups and we had to solve clues to help each other only communicating by walkie-talkie. Luke - our game master - was great. He was patient with 4 crazy teenagers and 4 moms. Can't wait to try another room at Red Door. Well run and lots of fun. We escaped with seconds to spare.

Five people I work with and we were joined by a great couple. It was such fun and very tough. It was my first time doing this and I'll be doing it again. Between the 8 of us, we got out with 0.9 seconds left.I highly recommend this for any group. Communication is foremost. Take your girl friend or wife."

So awesome that I came here twice all in one week. I went to Taken with my girlfriend, cousins, and their cousins. Then I took my friend from out of town to Prison Break. The puzzles were pretty challenging. The actors played a really great role. The staff here was amazing.This was a new experience. Something different in the DFW area to do to have fun. Whoever is looking for something new and different around he area to do, I recommend y'all to come here and give it a shot."
