"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/Escapism-the-attic,1,Awesome escape room!! Puzzles are great and not overtly hard...unless you over think some things (like I did). Their first room has a great setup and definitely gives you a museum feel. Can't wait for the second room!!

They said it was ""Legit"". They love it and escaped in 42 minutes. On the way home, the kids were figuring out whose birthday was next so they could go back and try the second room. Great job to Tangerine and staff! We will be back."

"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/Escapism-the-attic,6,"We had a blast at Escapism! It was my groups first time doing an ""escape room"" so we didn't know what to expect. You get exactly 1 hour to try and complete your mission. The escape room itself was challenging and full of surprises. There were 8 of us total and it definitely took teamwork! We escaped with only a few minutes to spare. The staff was really friendly, I would highly recommend! "
