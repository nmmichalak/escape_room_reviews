We had 10 people trying to help figure everything out so it was challenging. Thankfully, the staff helped us when we struggled and we had a blast!The props and rooms are excellent. The hidden room gave it an extra bonus of adventure! Thank you so much for a wonderful night and great memories... we will be back for sure!"

We've done two rooms now, and the puzzles are challenging enough for adults but enjoyable for our teens as well. The rooms are very well done and full of surprises - the Laboratory's twist is awesome! The staff is extremely friendly and remembered us from our first visit months ago. We'll definitely be back for the third room and cheerfully recommend Puzzled Escape to anyone looking for a fun time with family or friends."
