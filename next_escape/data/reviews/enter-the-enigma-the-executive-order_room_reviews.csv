I went for the first time with a group of friends who were visiting me from out of town. Everyone had a blast and the room (we tried out Executive Order) was challenging and exciting. 2 out of the 6 of us had done escape rooms before, and it was a good one for those of us who hadn't been through one yet. 10/10 would recommend. Thanks to the staff for making it extra enjoyable."

Very well done. We will be back."
