"Escape room ""Cashout"" by Puzzle Effect Gilbert in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-escape-room-gilbert-cashout,0,"To be honest, I had never heard of this concept before they opened this location. I went there with my family and we did the ""Cashout"" room. (It was difficult but we had a lot of fun).We were welcomed and guided by Nick and Ben, who did a wonderful job. They were both extremely friendly and very helpful. They answered our many questions in a very professional way.It was a great experience and I look forward to going back there and trying another room."

The staff member was friendly and filled us in. We did the Cash Out room which was an hour long. I should have known the longer the time, the harder the escape. We ended up getting every lockbox but two and the staff member walked us through the rest of the clues. It got everyone in the group thinking and it was a fun family activity."

The staff was great! The game was challenging! Definitely worth every penny. We will be back to escape a different room!
