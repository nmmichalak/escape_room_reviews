My friend and I were put into the toy story room and had a terrific time. We were able to escape with less than a minute left. The owners were very helpful and gave clues and assistance when needed. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend this.

Playing these rooms where hours of fun. We got out of the toy shop but not the attic that was a highly detailed room. And we wish we had more time to finish but the owner was so kind in letting us get to the end and helping us with the clues we did not see. All and all a great room and it just got better and better as we played. Can't wait for their next adventure coming soon. Don't miss this place. Fun for a date night or a group of friends. Bring your thinking caps. You'll need them.
