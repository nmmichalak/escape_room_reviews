"Escape room ""Wong's Chinese"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-wongs-chinese,0,"My family has done escape rooms around the world and the theming and experience of Mr. Wong's is one of the best we have seen! The puzzles are multi-linear, so there was always something for everyone to work on. My favorite park about this was the authenticity of the room and the variety of puzzles. Bring your A game to this room!"
"Escape room ""Wong's Chinese"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-wongs-chinese,1,All three rooms are well done and clever. Great puzzles and lots of effort from the designers. Recommend Wong's Restaurant but have done all three with solid enjoyment. Came to TX for a weekend event and did seven escape rooms during downtime; Wong's was a favorite!

"Escape room ""Wong's Chinese"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-wongs-chinese,3,"This is the mid level room, and a really fun challenge. We liked that this one had a bit of a different story line than most escape rooms, and the room is larger so there is a lot more ground to cover. We definitely needed more clues to solve it but it was a blast! They do such an amazing job making it a believable experience and also making the puzzles in each room vastly different. "
