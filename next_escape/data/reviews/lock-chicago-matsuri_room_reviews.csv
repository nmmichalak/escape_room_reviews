"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,0,This was the 2nd escape room I did at Lock Chicago's location in Evanston and one of my favorite rooms in the area! I went with my coworkers last month and did their Sunburn room which we loved so I came back with my family to try Matsuri and it did not disappoint. It was slightly easier than Sunburn was but we were still able to escape with 2 minutes to spare. Conveniently located right in downtown Evanston I work at Northwestern so it made it super easy to check these guys out. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,1,"My company had Lock Chicago come and do a mobile escape room event at our headquarters in Deerfield and we all loved it. My team and I then decided to do a smaller event at their actual location in Evanston and were recommended the ""Matsuri"" room. For most of us it was our first escape experience and I can tell you it won't be our last. The manager was super nice and we were able to get out just in time. We're already planning our next event in a few months to go back. "
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,2,"My husband and I had an escape room day planned where we went and did 4 escape rooms in the Chicago area - this was by far one of our favorites! Very friendly staff and were able to chat with the owners afterwards who were very passionate about the business and gave us a tour of their facility in Evanston! We can't wait to go back and try their other 2 escape rooms soon. Perfect for a night out with family, friends, coworkers or more!"
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,3,"I brought my students here for a team building event/field trip and they absolutely loved it! We did 2 rooms, Matsuri and Sunburn back to back and they were a fun experience for our class to do as a group. We didn't get out of Sunburn but the staff were nice enough to allow us to finish since we were so close. "
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,4,This was our 3rd escape room in the Chicago area and it was a blast. The staff were very friendly and did a great job explaining what to expect in the room while keeping it a surprise. The kids were raving about it and we’re already planning birthday parties to go back and try their other rooms. Located very close to Northwestern’s campus in downtown Evanston so lots of good restaurants and food options nearby too. 
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,5,My friends and I did Lock Chicago's Sunburn and Malfunction room back in 2016 when they opened and absolutely loved them. Naturally we couldn't wait for them to open their 3rd room which we did last week and IT WAS AMAZING. The owners were nice enough to show us the updates and changes they made since they moved to the new location in Evanston as well. The puzzles were a little easier than their other 2 rooms but still challenging and we were able to escape with just 3 minutes to spare. Definitely recommend checking this room out first at Lock Chicago!
"Escape room ""Matsuri"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-matsuri,6,"We have done at least 20 escape rooms by now and can say with confidence that the original 2 lock rooms were great. Sunburn we did with 6 people and got out and malfunction we did with 4 and got out. They were fun and challenging. However, their new room, Matsuri, was the easiest room we had ever done and not at all fun. If you had never done an escape room, this should be your first room. Anything after that will leave you wanting more. We walked out with a sour taste in our mouths, because we could not believe how easy and not mentally stimulating it was."

Did their Matsuri escape room - very challenging but just the right mix of difficulty. Very friendly staff and great location in Evanston can’t wait to go back!
