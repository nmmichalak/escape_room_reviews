"Escape room ""Zen Room"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-zen-room,0,"In terms of aesthetics, this is probably my favorite room ever! I just love how white everything is. I went with a group of 4 and this room was extremely fun, perfect for beginners. We escaped without asking for a single hint. Highly production value, great for beginners, would highly recommend for anyone who wants something on the easier side. "

We didn't think that this room was super difficult but for beginners, it would be a good start. The whole production of the room was really cool, and the room was non-linear so one thing necessarily didn't lead to another. We came late at night so parking wasn't an issue. The workers here are super nice and helpful. I'd come back to try their other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Zen Room"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-zen-room,2,This room brought peace and serenity and also frustration and urgency! It was a different kind of room and using all elements were fun and tactical. I loved every aspect of it from the moment I walked in to the moment we escaped. We did this room the day before my birthday and BOY this was a great gift to play. Come with a peaceful mind set.. don't struggle to think too hard..everything you need to know to solve a puzzle is in the room.

This room is definitely surreal and dreamlike in nature. I would say it's more of an adventure game than solving puzzles and opening locks. I love how the room tells a complete story from beginning to end, which adds a sense of accomplishment. "

It took a bunch of teamwork, trial and error and goofiness.In 36:49 we exited with a solid nod to Rose who helped us only three times.Go here and do your best!"
