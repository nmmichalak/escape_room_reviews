I've done these before and this was beyond my expectations. The puzzles were extremely challenging (we had 3 people :P) and it had the perfect amount of creepy. But for people who are freaked out by dolls...one may just creep on you. ;)

I would highly recommend the doll house especially for those who have had experience about going to escape rooms. The staff is super friendly and organized even helpful at times to make it fun. Definitely recommended.
