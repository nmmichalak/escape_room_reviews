"Escape room ""The Lost Jungle Safari"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-the-lost-jungle-safari,1,"For my second escape room experience, I brought three 13 and 14 year old boys that I babysit. The four of us took on the jungle room and we all had a blast solving the clues. We did escape but the boys also took full advantage of the use of the walkie talkie and asking for hints whenever they got stuck for more than a couple of minutes. The hints were helpful, though, and we were able to quickly move on to the next task with a little nudge. I thought that the dim lighting in the jungle room provided an extra challenge as it made things a little more hidden and harder to see. There was a good mixture of easy to more difficult steps to solving the puzzles and I love how these rooms force you to communicate and work as a team. I'd definitely love to come back and try other rooms in the future."

The gal that was assisting was awesome! This was my first time here and didn't know what to expect. She left us in the room with one clue. From there you look for the clue that she gives you and then you find another clue with one of the clues that you just found. We were in The Jungle Room and we had to find the gold skull. We did it under the our time but there were a few glitches that held us up due to someone putting a lock on backwards so there was no way we could ever get the lock opened to get another clue to move on to the next phase. She came in and helped us and figured out what was wrong and then gave us a free clue. You're allowed three Clues if you get stuck within the hour to help you move on. It was fun all of us got along and we did a lot of laughing. Looking forward to going back again.
