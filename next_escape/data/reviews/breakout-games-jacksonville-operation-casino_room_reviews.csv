"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-operation-casino,0,"What a fantastic, engaging, totally immersive outing! We did Operation: Casino with 5 teen/adult players and escaped with seconds left. The game consists of many number puzzles, clues to find, and locks to open. This was our first escape room experience and it was definitely difficult, but so very fun! It really makes you think and work as a team. The game master was helpful in guiding or redirecting but never gave anything away. Well worth the money! We will be back very soon. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-operation-casino,1,Had so much fun doing the Operation: Casino escape room.  Ashley was an awesome Game Master walking us through the rules and nudging us in the right direction when we asked for a clue.  The room was challenging but not overwhelming - It was amazing how quickly the hour flew by!  If we'd had about 10 seconds more we would have achieved a successful escape!  The defeat just makes me want to try my hand at another room!  Definitely a great way to spend an hour with friends and family!!!!

My daughter played before but at a different location. We were in the Casino room. I don't gamble so it was a bit difficult and there was a lot of math involved which isn't my strong point. Preston was great, explained allot and when we asked for clues explained them perfectly. Ready to do a different challenge."

Had an absolute blast. I decided we would do the Casino room. It was a little difficult at first because none of us were gamblers and we had a hard time getting started. After we asked Elizabeth for a clue she really helped us get rolling! She gave the perfect clues and explained everything to where we understood, but she was not telling us exactly how to play.We broke out with several minutes remaining, and I think if we wouldnâ€™t have wasted so much time in the beginning, we might have gotten out even sooner. We definitely want to play again and try and different room. We would also like to request Elizabeth! Just saying!"
