"Escape room ""Perfect Crime"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-perfect-crime,0,"My family of four - son and daughter, husband, and myself - had a great time in the Perfect Crime room! The puzzles were varied and fun to complete. I wish we were in town longer so we could go back and do the other rooms as well! Big hit with our young teens!"

We did a team-building event here and it was just great. We had the ""Perfect Crime"" room and it was really challenging, but we made it of the room in time. The puzzles are fun and diverse and the Game Master was very friendly. Surely an experience to repeat."

The theme was very cool and the puzzles were well thought out. The only complaint is how we were given a walkie-talkie to ask questions and hints. We were able to get out, however, we lost time due to the room monitor being busy with another group.Bottom line though, I definitely recommend this place and will try to come back next time I'm in DC."

I was a little skeptical when we first walked in but the game master (sorry can't remember name) quickly made us feel welcome. This was my seventh room so I already knew what to expect. All my expectations were quickly blown away, the diversity of puzzles was unlike any I've seen before. The story could have been better but because of how great the GM and room were I'm not taking a star away. I highly recommend this to anyone, it was a great time."
