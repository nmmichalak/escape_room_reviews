"Escape room ""Edgar Allan Poe -The Oval Portrait"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-edgar-allan-poe-room,0,"Nothing but great things to say about this place. I had never heard of an escape room, but when it was mentioned, it sounded intriguing. My group showed up super late on a weeknight but were treated like the first group that walked in the door. Being in Baltimore, we opted for the Edgar Allan Poe room, where he left ""clues"" as to what caused his death. As a group, we searched the room and worked together to find hints/clues to solve the mystery, and ""escape"" the room. It was challenging, exciting, and suspenseful! I absolutely plan on being back soon!"
"Escape room ""Edgar Allan Poe -The Oval Portrait"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-edgar-allan-poe-room,1,"This was our 25th escape room experience and while it's not our favorite it was a good room. We did the ""Poe"" room. It had a good theme and the puzzles weren't incredibly difficult they stretched the mind. We played another room in the Baltimore area and this is the better of the two. Head here for a decent escape room."
"Escape room ""Edgar Allan Poe -The Oval Portrait"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-edgar-allan-poe-room,2,Loved it! The Edgar Allan Poe room was amazing. What a great way to experience the escape room experience with a local connection. And Edgar Allan Poe relates so well to the mysterious and eclectic nature of an escape room. The challenge was tough but solvable our group of 5 made it with a few minutes to spare and we're excited by fact we never had to ask for a hint. The staff was awesome and Hardey made it a great day. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Edgar Allan Poe -The Oval Portrait"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-edgar-allan-poe-room,3,I had the opportunity to visit tonight with a group of 18 colleagues. This was perfect as we could divide into two teams. The Poe room was a blast! Very well thought out and challenging but a great way to get to know one another and laugh in the process. I highly recommend this as it is a true standout in Baltimore and even made the teachers think!
"Escape room ""Edgar Allan Poe -The Oval Portrait"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-edgar-allan-poe-room,4,"This is my third escape room - and I was pleasantly surprised with what the Edgar Allen Poe room had to offer. It was both difficult enough to be entertaining, yet had that slap your head ""I should have gotten that sooner"" feeling as you solved (or failed to solve) each item. They have clues, tricks, puzzles that are beyond the standard ""clue/lock"" combination, and even in the clue/lock combination situations, they managed to add a few layers to some of them to keep things interesting. Charm City Clue Room had the neat feature of giving you hints over a video screen if you get caught. "
