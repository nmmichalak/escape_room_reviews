"Escape room ""Ship Outta Luck"" by Surelocked In in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/surelocked-in-ship-outta-luck,0,"Our group just finished escaping Ship Outta Luck and managed a new record! It's a fabulous room with challenging puzzles, had enough twists to keep us on our toes and plenty to keep a large group busy. The room was well executed and you can tell the attention to detail was there. And major kudos to our actor who helped us get into the character and story for the experience. Highly recommend."

We chose the pirate-themed room “Ship Outa Luck” and with the help of our three clues, shockingly solved it with less than 2 minutes to go! If you’ve never done something like this before, I highly recommend it. Good times!"
