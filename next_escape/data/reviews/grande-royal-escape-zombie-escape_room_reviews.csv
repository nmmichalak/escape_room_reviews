"Escape room ""R.A.I.N. Corp - Zombie Escape"" by Grande Royal Escape in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/grande-royal-escape-zombie-escape,0,"We had an amazing time! We did the zombie room and it was challenging but a lot of fun. This was my 4th escape room and some of my friends first and we all thought it was amazing. If we're ever back in the area we will definitely be doing the other rooms, especially the train one!"

The puzzles were fun and interesting. We managed to make it out with barely 3 minutes left! The staff was also really kind and very helpful.
