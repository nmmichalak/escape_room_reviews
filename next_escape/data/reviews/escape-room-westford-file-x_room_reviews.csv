"Escape room ""File X: Area 51 Incident"" by Escape Room Westford in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-room-westford-file-x,2,"Many escape rooms don't do large groups well, but this Area 51-X Files themed game was perfect for both beginners and experts. We worked well together and requested two out of three available clues. Good combination of challenging and doable; nothing was too difficult. We finished in the Top Ten! We'll probably go back and try the other two games. The staff was very helpful too."
