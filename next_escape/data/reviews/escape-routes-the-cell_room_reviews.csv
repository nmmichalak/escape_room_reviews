"Escape room ""The Cell"" by Immersion in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-routes-the-cell,1,"Booked a team bonding event here for my office, and it was a lot of fun! We have a smaller team (6 people) so we felt this was the perfect activity. Ryan, the owner, was very friendly upon our arrival. The lobby area was huge and had a bunch of cool puzzles on the table to play with while you wait for your hour to start in the escape room. We booked The Cell and I have to say, it was hard! But we still managed to figure out all the puzzles and were only 1 away from escaping, but overall, it was a lot of fun! The puzzles were hard, but once you figure one out, you have that ""Aha!"" moment and feel pretty good about yourself, lol. The puzzles and the escape room were very cleverly and creatively thought out, and I'd love to come back to try out the other escape room they have. Thanks for a great time!"
