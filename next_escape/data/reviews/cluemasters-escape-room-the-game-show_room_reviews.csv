"Escape room ""The Game Show"" by ClueMasters Escape Room in Fort Smith",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-smith/quests/cluemasters-escape-room-the-game-show,0,Had a great experience there with some friends. We did the Game Show escape room and it was really fun.We did well through most of the puzzles but got hung up on the last one. Didn't use hints though and made it out with a little time to spare.The hosts were very kind and the experience was solid. Highly recommend for a fun group activity.

We went for my 30th birthday & had a blast! We ended up having the fastest time which was icing on the cake. The staff was awesome & helpful & made the whole experience even more worth it! Definitely recommend trying your hand at one of their rooms!
