The way the staff starts off acting really gets you immersed in the experience of the room. I recommend any of these rooms to anyone, though if you're just doing one, I'd say go for Blue Meth."

The theming in this room was excellent, putting you into a lot of seemingly dangerous situations without there being any actual danger of course. The chemistry parts are challenging but fun to do, and the actual sequence needed to escape the room is way different than any I've done before. Lots of fun puzzles, and highly recommended!"

We did the Blue Meth room and the Casino Heist and both were awesome! The rooms are decorated really well and the customer service is TOP NOTCH! Nick in the front was AWESOME! He was funny and welcoming and got us ready for the rooms with riddles. We really enjoyed our experience and hope to go back to do the other rooms. Thanks, Lockout Austin!"
