I guess..."" but the puzzles in this room were fun, clever, and very doable. Julie was very friendly and made it super accommodating for the 6 of us."
"Escape room ""Cabin 13"" by Legacy Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legacy-escape-rooms-cabin-13,1,"This room was so fun! Just the right amount of spooky without me flinching at everything I unlock in case of a jumpscare. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I will say I started in a mini room. The puzzles were challenging but not frustrating, and above all I they were fun. There were many puzzles where I thought ""wow, that's clever!""--and i have probably done about 20 escape rooms at this point. Decorations were great, and our game master Julie was SO good at explaining clues. Go here!"
