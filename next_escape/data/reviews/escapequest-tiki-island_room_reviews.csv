"Escape room ""Tiki Island"" by EscapeQuest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapequest-tiki-island,0,"We are escape room enthusiasts and have now run both their Tiki Island room and Speakeasy room.  Both rooms are very well done and thought out with attention to detail.  Well written, clever puzzles and will give your group a challenge all while keeping you immersed in the game the entire time.  Owners are beyond accommodating, write and design the rooms themselves and truly care about giving the guests the best experience possible.  We’ve run well over 50 rooms and EscapeQuest is top notch a truly entertaining experience! If you haven’t tried it, go!  Highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Tiki Island"" by EscapeQuest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapequest-tiki-island,1,"This was my first escape room though it will not be the last.  We did the tiki themed room that me, my girlfriend, and my cousin decided to do.  We were joined by two people that we had never met before.  One of which was an employee or owner of a different escape room.The puzzles were challenging without being overwhelming.  Really enjoyed the tiki theme and the fact that we were encouraged to immerse ourselves by going barefoot.  I was the only one of our group that chose to indulge.My favorite part was how when providing help when we got stuck the staff never made any hints too obvious.  Even when helping they made you work to progress through the challenges.  They always backed off until they were sure we were stuck before providing advice.  The help increased as we got close to the time limit.My only knock was the room was a little bit small and if you had a full group of 8 people I'm sure it would get crowded in a hurry and make it a little difficult to work on puzzles, but next time I'm in the area visiting family I look forward to trying the speakeasy room or the planned Alice in Wonderland themed room they are working on."

"Escape room ""Tiki Island"" by EscapeQuest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapequest-tiki-island,3,Had my son's 13th birthday party here. It was easy to schedule and the kids had a blast in the Tiki room. We rented out the party room for afterwards  - it was a very nice option for the kids to hang out for a bit after finishing up the quest. I highly recommend this for parties or group fun. The owners are very nice and personable!
