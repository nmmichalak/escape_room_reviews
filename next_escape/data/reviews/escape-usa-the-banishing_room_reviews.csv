"Escape room ""The Banishing"" by Escape USA in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-usa-the-banishing,0,"The Banishing: Very well done! it's complex and immersive. This is an excellent thing to do with friends. I felt very comfortable going through this with my little group of friends. Very important for we introverts! I think it's well worth what they charge and a nice amount of time for the experience. The design was immaculate and everything was seriously well researched! if you love spooky, horror or the paranormal do this. We escaped with 13 minutes to spare!"

The Banishing was my second time doing an escape room, and this was my sons first time ever. We had an absolute blast! The puzzles were well thought out and the staff was amazing at making sure the game ran smoothly. My boys haven't stopped talking about it since we got in the car. We are already planning our next escape and I can't wait to go back!"
"Escape room ""The Banishing"" by Escape USA in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-usa-the-banishing,2,We had SO MUCH fun at this escape room that we went back later in the day to go again! we dont live in GA (was in atlanta for a comic con) so we wanted to make sure we made time to come again before we left. The banishing room was SO creative and well thought out. we just needed a few more mintues! then we did the speakeasy room which was still very challenging (we needed one or two clues) but we did make it out :) i went with my husband and brother in law so its definitely a good time for all.
