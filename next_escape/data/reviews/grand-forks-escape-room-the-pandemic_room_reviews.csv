"Escape room ""The Pandemic"" by Grand Forks Escape Room in Grand Forks",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-forks/quests/grand-forks-escape-room-the-pandemic,0,"I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by our experience at the escape room. It was fun and challenging and was a welcome change from the usual local entertainment. I can hardly wait for the next ""problem"" that has to be solved. P.S. We saved the world with two minutes to spare."
