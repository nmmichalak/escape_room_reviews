It was all of our first escape room and it was absolutely amazing! I love the theme and that the employees dressed up, it was so awesome going back in time to a speakeasy. The ladies working were so nice and even though we didn't finish (soooo close!!) the ladies kept telling us how great we did and boosted us up that we didn't feel super bummed we didn't finish. Thank you!! We will definitely come back!"
