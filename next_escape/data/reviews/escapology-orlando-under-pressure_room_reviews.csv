"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-under-pressure,0,"This is probably one of my favorite escape rooms in Orlando. The rooms were very immersive and the game masters were very helpful. We did the Under Pressure room, which is the hardest room, but still escaped with time left on the clock. The rooms are amazing!"
"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-under-pressure,1,Had a great time! We did Under Pressure and Iâ€™ll say this - I felt the pressure! I used parts of my brain I never knew were there. Lots of fun and a great attraction to do with family and friends! We actually booked a second room to do before we leave! Highly recommend to those coming to visit or live in the area.
"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-under-pressure,2,"Just got out of the ""Under Pressure"" room with some friends. I have been to 3 other competing companies around the area and done most of the escape rooms they currently offer, and this room was one of the most challenging and fun ones we have completed. The theming was on POINT, there was just enough to do, and there were a few surprises along the way. And our game guide, James, was so much fun. He knew when to drop a hint and when to let us struggle for a bit. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend!"
