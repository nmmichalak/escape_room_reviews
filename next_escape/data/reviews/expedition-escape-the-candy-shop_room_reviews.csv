"Escape room ""The Candy Shop"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-the-candy-shop,1,I've done about 10 escape rooms and this place is by far the best I've been to! The rooms all have amazing props and puzzles. We did the Candy Shop tonight and you really feel like you're in a candy shop! Great job Expedition Escape! I'll definitely be returning!
