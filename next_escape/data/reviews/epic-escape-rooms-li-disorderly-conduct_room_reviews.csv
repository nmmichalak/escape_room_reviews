I would say better than some NYC escape the rooms. The staff is amazing amazing, so nice and friendly and really root for you to exit the room. We did the Disorderly Conduct, which was hard, but we had a blast. Highly recommend and looking forward to returning and going to the other rooms!"

Did Disorderly Conduct which was more challenging than I expected but it was a lot of fun and left us with a lot of head-scratching moments. Wasn't scary so good for all ages and for the faint of heart. We got out just in time with 2 minutes to spare. The experience was super affordable which is a huge bonus. Coming back for my birthday in a couple of weeks to try killer!"

Our first visit was perfect and we escaped the Disorderly Conduct room with 45 seconds to spare. We came back for the Killer Feature room with a group of 6 and won with about 14 mins to spare.Rooms are creative, well thought out, and challenging enough to keep you interested as well as constantly using team work and brain power to solve the puzzles.The staff were excellent. E and Kat, spectacular."
