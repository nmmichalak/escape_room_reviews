"Escape room ""Central Bank"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-central-bank,0,"Super fun. First time doing escape room. Saw many great reviews and it didn't disappoint. Did the bank robber one. Super difficult but so much fun. We were so close too! Highly recommend for any group of folks that just want to have fun, team build, or for bday celebrations like in my case."
"Escape room ""Central Bank"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-central-bank,1,"The Bank Heist room was cool. They gave us some cool things to make us feel like we were robbing a bank which added to the overall experience.As far as design, the sound effects were nice, but the decorations could have been a little more immersive. Puzzles had a good flow to them. We got stuck on a few of them and one of the puzzles was missing a key but the game master caught the error right away and fixed it. Customer service was great. We escaped with a few minutes to go."
"Escape room ""Central Bank"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-central-bank,2,Amazing night of fun! This was our first experience with an escape room and it lived up to the hype. We had the Central Bank room which was extremely challenging. Although we didn't escape the room ( 25% success per Fox in a Box) we made it into the vault and are now even more determined to go back and finish the job. Highly recommend for a fun night out!!
