Nice employees who clearly outline the goals, dos and don’ts. The only thing I would’ve like to have seen are puzzles that are more directly involved in the plot behind the story of the room. A couple puzzles seemed to exist for the sake of being an obstacle. It’s not really a complaint, it just has me thinking about the room design is all."

We did the Murder of Crows room - no need to know all about Edgar Allen Poe. We wouldn't have solved our room without the help we got, but we celebrated each time we put a clue together!"
