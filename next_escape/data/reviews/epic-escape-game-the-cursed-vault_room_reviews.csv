"Escape room ""The Cursed Vault"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-the-cursed-vault,0,This was our first time going to an escape room and all I can say is AMAZING! This place rocked! We had a group of 7 and almost finished - maybe next time;) Our just Donnie was great as well! I highly recommend visiting them for your next adventure!

Jack was very personable and made us feel at ease about that. They truly did a wonderful job of the story line and although we did not escape (but did come very close), the level of difficulty was appropriate. Great team there and very welcoming. We cannot wait to go back!"
