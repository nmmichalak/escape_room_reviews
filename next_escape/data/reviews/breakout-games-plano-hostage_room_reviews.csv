"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Plano in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/breakout-games-plano-hostage,0,"The Hostage Escape was Awesome! I took my 3 kids and hadwe had a couple more minutes, we would have escaped. Our game master, Kenny, did an incredible job giving us hints without revealing the answer. This room was challenging with some really cool tricks to figure out to solve the clues. We are looking forward to coming back, hopefully this week, to do another room.  Great Time!"
