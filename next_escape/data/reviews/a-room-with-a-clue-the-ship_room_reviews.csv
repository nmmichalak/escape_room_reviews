"Escape room ""The Ship"" by A Room with a Clue in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/a-room-with-a-clue-the-ship,0,"My family and friends gathered for the holidays and decided to attempt an escape room. We joined another group with nine of us did ""The Ship"".  Most of us had experienced several different escape rooms, and I have to say this one was a disappointment.First off, this room was recommended for a group of up to ten people, but it was too small for our group of nine. The decor did not even resemble a ship.  The clues were very serialized so most of us were standing around waiting for someone else to perform a task. At one point I noticed a friend sitting on the couch waiting for it to all be over.This challenge required a lot of reading and scanning through multiple books to extract the clues.  To complicate matters the room was dimly lit, and some of the text was very hard to read.  When we got stuck and requested a clue, we found out the walkie-talkie was dead.Don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter that we didn't escape. We were set up for failure. There was much effort to get us to buy in to ""the story"" and little effort to make it a fun experience. If this had been my first experience, I wouldn't have ever tried again. I cannot recommend this room."

I wasn't sure what to expect as it was my first time participating in such an event, but we had a blast - an hour went by super fast. We actually won the game! Yay! I am looking forward to try the Theater one. One thing I wish is that the rooms were slightly larger in size, as it was a bit crowded when all of us were in one room on the ship (the first room), but overall this was a great way to spend the Saturday afternoon!"

The theater room at A Room With A Clue is the best room I've played, hands down! Wonderful experience, awesome space, great owners! Go play!"
