Really liked the “in character” acting too! The room we did was Press Start and it was VERY WELL put together! Thanks for letting us play can’t wait to play the next two rooms :)

Their newest room (Press Start), has a very unique hint delivery system. Additionally, all three rooms had a unique start to them that I was not expecting. None of the rooms have screens keeping time but they have a fun way of keeping the time for you. We will be going back once they open new rooms."
