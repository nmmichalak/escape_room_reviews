It was challenging and so much fun. You can tell the people here are very passionate about what they do. They were friendly and very thorough. It can be overwhelming at first walking into a room without knowing where to start but that's what makes it fun. You need to think outside the box and work together. Everything will come together at the end; if you can get there. Not everyone can make it out, but that's ok. Then go back and try it again. If it was so easy, it wouldn't be as much fun. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I certainly will be back!!"
"Escape room ""Villain's Lair"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-villains-lair,2,We just did a 40 minute room with my 11 year old son and his four friends. The kids had a good time. The clues were challenging enough for the kids but not impossible. We will be back. We had a wonderful experience. Aiden and Theresa were very helpful and kind to the kids.
