Will be going back soon. I have been twice. Once was to do Outbreak, which we didn't escape. Second was to do bank Heist (80% completed). Can't wait to go back and do the Sorcerer's room."

Planned this for my sister's bachelorette party and we had a blast. We did Outbreak: Find the Cure and we won the game! I would recommend the game if you are up for a real challenge. There is a good amount of needing to read further into the puzzles. Overall, lots of fun!"
