"Escape room ""Last Will"" by Escape Out of the Box in Zeeland",https://worldofescapes.com/zeeland/quests/escape-out-of-the-box-last-will,0,I did Last Will with 4 kids age 8-11 and they all loved it. And were great problem solvers! They were engaged the whole time. Lots of fun tricks and challenges in the room-I was amazed. We think we solved one of the puzzles over lunch so we may need to go back.
