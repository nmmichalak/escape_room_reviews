"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Mad Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mad-escape-bank-heist,0,Great experience. The bank heist was so much fun!
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Mad Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mad-escape-bank-heist,1,"Did the bank heist room as a family. The staff is very friendly and the facility is clean. I did not think I was an escape room person, having done one previously at another location and was not impressed.  However, I had a lot of fun at this one.  The room was very interactive with lots of props.  They do give you lots of clues throughout it, which helps you get through it but takes away part of the challenge.  It's always more fun to ""escape"" the room, I guess.  Overall, I'm excited for the two new rooms coming soon and will be back."
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Mad Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mad-escape-bank-heist,2,Was looking for something fun to do with the family. Came across this place. WOW! I was blown away with this place. I've been to a few other escape rooms but this one makes the others look outdated. You must play the Bank Heist!!! We did 2 bookings at the same time. Adults went to play Bank Heist and the kids played Slime Factory. Will be coming back to play the other rooms for sure! :D
