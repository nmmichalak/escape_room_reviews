My husband and I were in a group of 12 (strangers), which made for some difficult communication from time to time...but we still had a wonderful experience! I recommend doing this with a group of your own family/friends large enough, or with reservations specified to do it with only the people that you know. That way, you can possibly move more quickly (or not!) and experience every task in the room!Definitely worth the money! I am hooked and I will be back to do more escape rooms (Deadwood and the Manor, when it is complete). (2 1/2 hr drive)"
