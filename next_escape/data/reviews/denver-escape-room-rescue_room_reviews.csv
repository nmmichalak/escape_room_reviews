"Escape room ""R.E.S.C.U.E."" by Denver Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/denver-escape-room-rescue,0,"SO FUN! GO DO IT! Well, if you like puzzles. I honestly have not had that much fun in a long time. I felt like a kid again! Except for the fact that I would not have been much help as a kid.We got there and the place was a little difficult to find. They had signs posted everywhere but we went at night and the signs are black. We did see it though so we got there! The staff was very nice and answered all of my random, obnoxious questions because I always have some. While we were waiting, we were messing around with some brain teasers. I heard lots of yelling and banging so I was kind of freaking out but it wasn't scary.We did RESCUE which has a 3.3% success rate. We thought we were smart and were going to get out just fine. Even if it was our first one. NOPE! We technically did escape and saved the girl. Just 20 seconds after the bomb went off...as ghosts. This is definitely a fun puzzle game and I can't wait to do another one! Our whole groups loves thinking outside the box so I think that helped up out and hindered us as we were thinking too outside the box sometimes!"
