"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,0,"Our family has been to about 80 escape rooms around the world.  The Last Supper was amazing.  The actor was great.  The clues were interesting (but not ridiculously impossible).  The clues were well designed and sequential, making it an excellent experience."
"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,1,"     They have my new favorite game! It's been about 6 months since I last played a room. But I've done about 40 now in total. Both games were wonderful. Some seriously genius puzzles that fit the theme and made sense to be there, especially in the witch game. Their other game, The Last Supper, was the amazing! I'd consider it a a thriller/horror game. But the unexpected and best part to me was that I have never laughed so much while playing an escape room. Or maybe in the last few months of my life lol. They set up moments to make us laugh, or for us to make ourselves laugh. The actor was great, the story flowed perfectly. As well as continuously throughout, constantly developing to immerse us further and further. Timing of the puzzles allowed us to finish with only a few minutes to spare. My biggest wish is I want to get amnesia so I can just forget it and play it over and over haha. Thanks for the great evening!"
"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,2,I'm a huge enthusiast with escape rooms and let me say that quest tavern escape room didn't disappoint. Last supper was a phenomenal experience as it gave you the adventurous feeling in addition to that hint of fright and jump scares. They have a lot of different selections and I highly recommend for everyone that reads this to try it out.
"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,3,The Last Supper is one of my favorites of all escape rooms I've done. I thought the puzzles were great and I loved the interactive nature of it. There were definitely a few jumps and scares. If I could I would go back and do it again!
"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,4,Hands down the best escape room out there! We did the witch's cauldron a few weeks ago and loved it! We were told another scary room was opening soon so we decided to come back and give it a try! The last supper was the BEST room I've done so far. The actors are amazing and there is the right amount of scare to keep you on the edge of your seat (you'll know what I mean) but not soo much where you can't solve the puzzles. Definitely recommend 100%!!!
