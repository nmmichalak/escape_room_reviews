"Escape room ""Escape the Haunted Room"" by Escape Savannah in Savannah",https://worldofescapes.com/savannah/quests/Escape-Savannah-The-Haunted-Room,0,We had a great time here. We even had a friendly ghost that floated around the room with us. I can't wait until their new one comes out. I highly recommend this if you have some time to kill.

Overall, the experience was top notch. The overall theme was really cool for Savannah and the good news is that we escaped - but only with like 3 minutes remaining (and we only had to use one small hint)! It was a lot of fun and the escape was a perfect balance of being difficult, but not impossible. We were placed with another random group because there was only two of us, but it was kind of fun being forced to work with strangers. This was one of the highlights of our trip! Thanks!!"

The Haunted House was difficult and we did not actually escape, but made progress. The *creepy* ghost component was really special. Highly recommend."

Currently (as of May 2017) they have two different themes that you can do, and we did the Escape the Haunted Room theme. It was very entertaining, and we would definitely go back to do the Escape the Pirates theme or a new escape room in the future! High recommended."
"Escape room ""Escape the Haunted Room"" by Escape Savannah in Savannah",https://worldofescapes.com/savannah/quests/Escape-Savannah-The-Haunted-Room,5,I took my father to Escape Savannah while he was in town visiting. This was the first time any of us had done an escape room. We did the haunted ghost room and had a blast. The room was challenging and scary all at the same time. I'm already planning my next trip down to do the pirate room. I would definitely recommend this activity.
