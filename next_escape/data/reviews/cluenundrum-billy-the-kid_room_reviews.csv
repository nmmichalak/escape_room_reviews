"Escape room ""Billy the Kid"" by Cluenundrum in Las Cruces",https://worldofescapes.com/las-cruces/quests/cluenundrum-billy-the-kid,1,I've done quite a few escape rooms and was pretty surprised that we had a place here in LC! I went there for my bday with a few of my friends who were first timers. We all enjoyed it and managed to escape with 9 or so mins left on the clock. I really liked the theme because it fits the LC area perfectly. It was challenging and very interesting. We all worked as a team and it was really nice to see my friends solving stuff and having fun.
