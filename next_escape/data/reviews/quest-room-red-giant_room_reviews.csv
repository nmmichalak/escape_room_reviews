"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,0,My friends and I did the Red Giant room. It is one of the best rooms we have done. The puzzles were intricate and each room had unique tech that made it a lot of fun.
"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,1,"Took my 8 year old niece here and we had SO much fun. We did the easiest room (the red giant)and it was just the right amount of challenging for the adults and some simple things that she was able to do. Honestly, she probably figured out more than the adults (she's a smarty like that). It was great for her because it was so interactive and hands on. We've been to many rooms that are just a bunch of locks and keys and that's not what this one was. Props and statues put in the right place would activate a movement. It was well done!! The man at the beginning was great at getting my niece excited. He explained so sweetly about the game and made it sound so fun that she was confident and ready to conquer. That intro made it!"
"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,2,"This review is for Red Giant only.""Red Giant"" refers to a ruby in a crypt, not the planet, so leave your space helmets at home.Parking here is super convenient in the back of the building, but the driveway leading to the parking lot is FILLED with potholes, and when we went there, a giant pond was formed b/c of the rain. There is a ring doorbell and the words ""QUEST ROOM"" in red next to the door. It looks super sketch back there.But once you ring the bell and enter, it is NICE inside. It's obvious that they put a lot of effort in building and maintaining the place. The room itself is VERY well thought out, from where they orient you, to the hints, to the final puzzle. We only needed two hints. The first hint we needed because we weren't patient enough, and the second hint we needed because we weren't as observant when we first entered the tomb as we should have been. There were a couple of times when we received unsolicited hints because we weren't on the right track, which was really nice of them.All in all, I LOVED how this room was designed. Everything really fit well. If I were to change anything, it would be to minimize the Many pages of text in this one book. It's fun, but the book was filled with red herrings, which you don't realize are red herrings until you get to the end and the book explicitly explains which pages are important. I highly recommend this room!"
