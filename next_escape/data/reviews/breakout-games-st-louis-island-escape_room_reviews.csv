"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - St. Louis in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/breakout-games-st-louis-island-escape,0,Had an absolute BLAST!  Our family did the Island Escape.  Sadly we didn't make it out in time but we had so much fun.  We were celebrating my brother-in-law's birthday so there were 7 of us in the room.  Literally you walk in and there were clues but nothing else.  You really have to use your mind to figure out that everything in the room is a clue.Our family has decided we are going to do this on a regular basis.

Just came home from Breakout and the Island Escape room. Unfortunately we didn't make it in time - we were only three puzzles away. Logan let us finish to see how close we were. Very entertaining, will recommend to friends!"
