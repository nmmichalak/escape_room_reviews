"Escape room ""Claustrophobia"" by Number One Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/number-one-escape-room-claustrophobia,0,My sister and I just played Claustrophobia and we loved it!  The game is based of the Seven deadly sins and is part one of a two part game. So we played two hours. The second part of the game is chained.  It was so crazy as we played side by side in a box (I donâ€™t want to give anything away) but it is a tough game.  We had to work together and the games are very unique.

We've done a bunch of escape rooms throughout the valley and Number One Escape Rooms are the best! The production value is high and there are many unique elements to make for a fun, yet challenging escape room experience. The claustrophobia room was super cool and added the extra scare element of being trapped in a box. It definitely elevated the escape room experience! Thank you, Number One Escape Rooms!"
"Escape room ""Claustrophobia"" by Number One Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/number-one-escape-room-claustrophobia,2,We did claustrophobia. Definitely a different vibe than your usual room because you're basically in a box coffin. Not too easy to breathe - wish there was air vents or more air circulation bc half way through it gets difficulty. Glad for the hints and glad we made it out! Not for the novice
