It's so worth it, don't think twice about booking this for your family. We talked about it all the next day. Teenagers and adults worked to solve and we did escape but it was super fun!"

"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-game-orlando-mission-mars,3,I have played every game and mission to mars was a different but fun change of pace. Still hands down the best escape game out there. 
"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-game-orlando-mission-mars,4,We did the Mission Mars and had a blast. There were a total of nine of us in the room and it was very well decorated. Unfortunately we couldn't do the other four rooms here as we had already did them at their Austin TX. location. Would highly recommend.
