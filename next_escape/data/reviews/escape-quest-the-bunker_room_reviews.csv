"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Quest in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-quest-the-bunker,0,"I went with a large group of people, and we really enjoyed this room. We had small groups working on several clues at once. Our only complaint was some of the clues were too difficult, and the hint didn't help us that we spent a majority of the last 20 minutes in the room stuck. It was one of the most detailed escape rooms I've been to, and if you are looking for a challenge, i recommend it!!"
