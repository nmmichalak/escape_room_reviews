"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-nashville-do-not-disturb,0,"My best friend and I visited last week intending to play one game only. The first was so much fun that we decided to stay for two. Our game masters, Alyssa and Emma, were top notch. They were friendly, informative and very engaged during the game. There is no doubt we'll be back sooner than later. Thanks so much Alyssa and Emma. Y'all rock!!"

"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-nashville-do-not-disturb,2,"WE completed two escape rooms in a minimum of one week and each one was FREAKING AWESOME! This is definitely something meant for all ages and all people. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend these Breakout Games - Nashville! Both times we didn't have a reservation, yet they ensured that we got in and had an awesome time!"
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-nashville-do-not-disturb,3,"Awesome escape rooms - these are the real deal.  Terrific customer service too!We played 5 of their 6 rooms on a Sunday during out Nashville Escape Room trip.  We have now played over 300 rooms and these rooms are very good rooms with fun elegant puzzles.  Of course I cannot say too much without providing a spoiler...Our top room was Do Not Disturb it had some features we have not seen before.  The game progression of Do Not Disturb probably made it our favorite.  The puzzles were varied and kept the focus of the room on the theme - there are some very fun electronic/technical interactions which are immersive - everything worked.  Mystery Mansion also had a nicely designed set and offered a puzzle technique we had not seen before that was totally in keeping with the theme.  Casino is also recommended for it immersive set and puzzles that fit right in with the theme of the room.   Island Escape had some surprises but it probably has the simplest set with least amount of cool set design features (as compared to their others) - but there is one feature in the room that interacted with us in a surprising and fun way...and was built in to the puzzle scheme. The only room we played which we did not love was Runaway Train - the set is first rate but there are 2 puzzles which stood out amongst all the puzzles (60+) we encountered in the 5 rooms as not fun because of their design (one was a long busy work puzzle and one required a logic leap not clued)...also there was a slight mishap in the room set-up which resulted in us finding a key for a container already open.  On a positive note - the final puzzle sequence was very fun and we ended our experience on a high from that.We played the five rooms over the course of a day (coming and going) and everyone we encountered was pleasant and helpful - out game masters Rachel, Emily, Ella and Hanna all were fantastic! We appreciate the private room booking policy - as all of these rooms are playable with 2 to 4."
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-nashville-do-not-disturb,4,"Absolutely phenomenal. Do Not Disturb was just the right amount of creepy to not be too scary for the youngest in our group, but just to get adrenaline pumping rushing for the clock! Definitely a hard room, but so fulfilling when you break out, with a really cool plot twist! No spoilers though ;)"
