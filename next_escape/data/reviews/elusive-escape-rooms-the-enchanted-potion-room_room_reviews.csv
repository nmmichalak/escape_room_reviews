"Escape room ""The Enchanted Potion Room"" by Elusive Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/elusive-escape-rooms-the-enchanted-potion-room,0,"We had a great time! Challenging but fun!! Enchanted Potion Room was family friendly. Staff was very friendly. Even my nephew (who didn't want to do an escape room), had the best time ever and wanted to do another room!"
"Escape room ""The Enchanted Potion Room"" by Elusive Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/elusive-escape-rooms-the-enchanted-potion-room,1,Me and my girlfriend went in late last night and the amazing staff was able to fit us into the schedule without reservations. We did the Potions Class and came extremely close to winning with just the two of us. A really fun experience and definitely worth trying if you've never tried and escape room before. Thank you for the fun time Chloe!
"Escape room ""The Enchanted Potion Room"" by Elusive Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/elusive-escape-rooms-the-enchanted-potion-room,2,We did the Potions room and it was so much fun! Highly recommend! And the staff was great too and very helpful. We had 6 adults in this room and feel it wouldâ€™ve been pretty difficult for children.
