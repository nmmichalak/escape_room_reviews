"Escape room ""Blacksite"" by Escape the Place in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escape-the-place-black-site,0,We did a room for my husband's surprise birthday party and it was a huge hit. All of the adults and teenagers loved it. We did Blacksite. It is definitely something that makes you think and work together as a group. The staff was amazing and we fell in love with the concept and will definitely be back. I am so glad they finally have something fun for adults and teenagers to do together as a group. Amazing!
