"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/The-Escape-Game-Austin-The-Heist,0,We were visting Austin this past weekend and decided to do The Heist. This was my 5th Escape room and was definitely one of my favorites. The puzzles were challenging and the room was a ton of fun! Our room guide did an excellent job providing clues when we needed them. We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.

Lots of puzzles to do and fun for the entire group! We went as a group of six and no one felt left out because there was so much to observe.Story wise, the Heist initially sounded like we were supposed to steal something, but it was more of a covert operation to take something back from a thief."

It proved to be a challenge but was a lot of fun, we cut it close escaping with 31 seconds on the clock! I've never felt so confused and brilliant in the matter of an hour. "
