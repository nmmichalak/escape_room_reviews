This is the first time I've ever turned to my teammates and stated that the room and puzzles were really cool, while in the middle of trying to escape. Going back soon."

The Cat Burglar was a great experience. Very well thought out. Great props and accessories. Just enough guidance to get us through. We finished (partnered with another family) with 1:25 to spare! What a gem that was hiding right in front of us in downtown Sanford! This was my second escape room and my son's fourth. By far the best out of all that we've been too!
