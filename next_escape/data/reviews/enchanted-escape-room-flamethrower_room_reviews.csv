This place was close to our work and we decided to give it a shot picking the hardest room. Even though we failed the CIA Task Force, it had everything I wanted in a great escape room. The immersion, technology and flow of the room made sense. The owner and his wife were great and accommodating. I'll definitely be back to try their easier rooms in the near future!"

We did the TFA room which is high tech and well thought out. Also, the customer service is outstanding. Can't wait to come back and try the other rooms!"
