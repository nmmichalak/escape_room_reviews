"Escape room ""Wonderland"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-wonderland,0,My son and I were in the Alice in Wonderland room and had a fabulous time. The owners designed and built the room which was really cool :-).

It was so much fun! The owner was so helpful, informative and friendly. We did the Wonderland room. We had to solve puzzles and clues to find Alice's necklace. We would definitely do this again. "

The room was perfectly suited for us as beginners and although we had some help along the way, managed to solve the room with time to spare. Kids can't stop talking about it. Highly recommend for families seeking some quality time and memories!"
