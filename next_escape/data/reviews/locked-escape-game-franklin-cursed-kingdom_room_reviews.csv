We made it out with 5 minutes to go. Used all 3 clues and the 8 girls with us were all honor students, couldn't have made it out without them. Was super fun and well put together. Staff was friendly and patient with a place full of laughing teen girls. Highly recommend."

We played the Cursed Kingdom game, and really enjoyed all the puzzles. We used two hints and got out with 14:39 to spare. We are ready to go back to a different room to try to beat our time. Yes, we're a competitive group!"
