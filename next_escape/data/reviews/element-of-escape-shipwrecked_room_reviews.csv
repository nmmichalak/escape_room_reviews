"Escape room ""Shipwrecked"" by Element of Escape in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/element-of-escape-shipwrecked,0,"Had a lot of fun here tonight! This is my 6th game in various locations and I enjoyed this one immensely! My cousin and I did the Shipwrecked room. It was challenging but really good! I was surprised it was only one room as all that I've done before have led to another room, but considering the story it made sense.The woman who gave us clues was great. Super friendly and helpful at the right times.I totally recommend this place if you're in the area."
