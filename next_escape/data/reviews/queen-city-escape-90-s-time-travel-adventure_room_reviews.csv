"Escape room ""90s Time Travel Adventure"" by Queen City Escape in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/queen-city-escape-90-s-time-travel-adventure,0,"I'm a repeat visitor at Queen City Escape. I've completed the 90's room, Stranger Things room, and the Seven Wonders room. Each time has been so much fun! The puzzles are great and you can tell that a lot of though was put into each room. I've had a great time with as few as 4 people and as many as 9. Luckily I've escaped every time, usually with less than a minute left so it gets pretty intense. I can't wait to go back!"

It was perfect for a couple and we had a ton of fun. We ended up escaping in about 40 minutes. The staff is very friendly and explained things well.
