"Escape room ""The Revolution"" by Escape Key in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-key-las-vegas-the-revolution,1,"This was my first Escape Room, and I would recommend this place! Unfortunately, it was late night so most escape rooms were closed, but the owners were nice enough to accommodate us. They seem to be pretty experienced and enthusiastic about what they do.On top of being a cool pair of people, the Escape Room was well thought out and each step is pretty logical. They even went as far as to put separate people in different positions in the room according to certain characteristics like who is easily scared, who considers themselves smart, etc. The rooms are also complete with a story.Escape Key is friendly to both newbies and veterans, the price is completely reasonable, and it's a lot of fun! Definitely recommended!"
"Escape room ""The Revolution"" by Escape Key in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-key-las-vegas-the-revolution,2,"Our group (Escape Junkies) did the Revolution room last night. We've done approximately 30 escape rooms in Las Vegas, and I can say that this room is definitely unique and brought a great challenge. We appreciate rooms that are unique and well thought out. This one did just that. Tim, the owner and room designer, did an excellent job! Just talking with him briefly, I can tell he's very passionate when it comes to escape rooms and puzzles. His design craft definitely showed out!In addition, a major factor in which I rate an escape room experience is the way the game master delivers our hints. Tim was able to thoroughly direct and guide us when asked, without ""telling us"" the answer, which was a major plus for the experience. I would definitely recommend this escape room experience for all levels!"
