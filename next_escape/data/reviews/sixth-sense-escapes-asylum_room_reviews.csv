"Escape room ""Asylum"" by 6th SE6SE Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/sixth-sense-escapes-asylum,0,"This is the only room I would recommend at 6th Se6se, and then only with 2-4 people (and only if you can't get in with one of the better businesses within a 30-40 min drive). We did the room with 6 people (not the max allowed). We mostly enjoyed the beginning, minus one lock that was exceptionally touchy (the owners know that lock type is hard to use and still keep it in the room, why?). But the beginning requires a lot of teamwork and there's a real sense of accomplishment when you reach the second stage of the room. This is where things go to pieces. The second room is smaller than the first room you start in, despite everyone needing (or at least wanting) to be in that second room b/c that's where nearly all the rest of the puzzles are. Lots of confusion b/c of people bumping into each other and overlapping conversations. Room is full of conventional locks, but not a lot of cluing to point you to which lock the key/code goes to, so lots of guess-and-check.We experienced a pretty major reset failure, with one of the owners frantically trying to reset the final puzzle while we were working our way through the room."

Went with my family through the Asylum Room - it was really thrilling. Even though we didnâ€™t escape we had a lot of fun, and the owners are really awesome. Very personable and nice!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by 6th SE6SE Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/sixth-sense-escapes-asylum,2,My daughter's and I went to give Mommy a night of and had a ton of fun. The owners have a great setup. We did not escape the asylum in time but had a blast trying to figure the different puzzles out. It was very hard with three people (two of which were under 12) but would totally recommend bringing lots of your friends for that room (up to 12). Next time we are going to break into the bank vault!Thank you for giving us such a great time!

We chose the Asylum room and it was fun and challenging for us. I highly recommend it for your family gatherings and team building or just fun times with your friends. You definitely have to work together to solve the clues and get out. The owners were very friendly, cooperative and informative when I called for info.  It was a bonus to find this entertainment in Clayton and not have to travel far."
