Creepy, challenging, and creatively put together. The staff were awesome as well - very entertaining and customer service oriented. We also noticed they have a lively game night at Will You Escape. Another reason to go back."
"Escape room ""Serial Killer"" by Will You Escape? in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/will-you-escape-serial-killer-room,1,I've done quite a few escape rooms around the country in the last year and this one is definitely at the top of my list! Difficult but not impossible. My group escaped with 1 minute 32 seconds to spare. Great for team building or just a fun excursion with friends. A must do whether you live in Tucson or you're just visiting.
