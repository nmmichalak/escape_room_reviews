My group of 8 with all ages was challenged and engaged the entire time. We LOVED The Madness! We also loved the amazing staff who provided extras knowing it was a special day for us. You are all amazing and we will definitely be back to try all the rooms! Thank you again for a fun filled awesome time!

The place is well ran and so much fun. Solving puzzles while racing the clock is a blast. Go with friends and have a good time, but be prepared to think. These aren't easy and you'll have to work together to solve the mysteries. The clues are challenging, but manageable with some deduction. The rooms are set up to make you feel like you are in the story and are the detectives. I highly recommend this place. Where else can you go for this much fun at this low of a price? You won't regret it."
