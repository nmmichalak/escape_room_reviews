We were able to escape with 6 minutes to spare. This was my first experience, as well as most of the staff. Everyone enjoyed the experience and had a lot of fun. I can definitely see coming back and even bringing kids - there was a puzzle which I think is suitable for even younger children. We had a good experience with the staff and while we did not ask for help with clues, we did read 2 or 3 clues on the monitor, which helped. A great time was had by all!"

To my surprise, we had a great time and it was extremely stimulating and challenging. I went in grumpy and came out delighted. Really. Thanks Hour Escape."
