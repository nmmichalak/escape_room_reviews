"Escape room ""Baker Street Mystery"" by Escape Games at The River in Rancho Mirage",https://worldofescapes.com/rancho-mirage/quests/escape-games-at-the-river-baker-street-mystery,0,"This place was awesome! I am an avid escape room attendee and I thought this place was so well put together. The puzzles were challenging and the room was great! (We did the Baker Street one). I was just here to visit, but when I come back I will definitely be coming back!! Also, the staff was so helpful and nice!"

It was definitely a challenging room but not impossible. The owner/game host was really nice, he even stopped the clock when he had to come in and assist with a lock that wouldn't open even though we had the right combination. It was a fun little stop on our vacation, we will come back to try their other rooms the next time we come out to Palm Springs."

Came for a bachelorette party of four girls, and all newbies to the escape room phenom. We were nervous because we didn't know what to expect, especially when the guy told us we picked the hardest room (Baker Street Mystery). But it was a BLAST! And it was challenging without being impossible, really had to use your brain but it was exciting and fun! Would love to come back to try the other rooms! A definite must do! :)"

Even tho we didn't ""win"" by the time limit, it was so much fun. I will definitely be trying the other rooms. Baker Boys was the one I did.....very hard!"
