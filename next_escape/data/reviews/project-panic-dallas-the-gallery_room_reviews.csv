"Escape room ""The Gallery"" by Project Panic Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/project-panic-dallas-the-gallery,0,I've done so many escape rooms and this was by far my favorite I've ever done! I love all the technology. We did the gallery and cannot wait to come back and do more. The two working at the front were very friendly as well. Highly recommend!!

I did the Gallery room and it had some very hard clues that luckily my friends were able to figure out. Lots of parking nearby and drinks and food if you wanted to grab a drink afterward. Also, the mural in the lobby area is a great photo opportunity ðŸ˜„"

The staff members are hilarious and provide just the right amount of guidance. The location is great, so you can grab food/drinks before or after. I had a blast with my friends!"
