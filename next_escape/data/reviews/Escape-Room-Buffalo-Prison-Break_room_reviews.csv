Very creative and a great way to spend time together. Really liked the fact that they will give you extra time to get out if you go over one hour- even though we didn't need it! Will definitely go back and recommend to friends."
"Escape room ""Prison Break 2.0"" by Escape Room Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Escape-Room-Buffalo-Prison-Break,2,We had such a fun time in the prison break room today! The game has so many little details to figure out and we had a really good time putting the clues together. Luckily we got a few hints to help push us in the right direction. We went 2 minutes over the hour time limit but they let us finish anyway. Next time I'm home in Buffalo I'd love to go back and try another room
