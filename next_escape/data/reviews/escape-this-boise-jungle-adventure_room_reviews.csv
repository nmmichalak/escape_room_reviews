"Escape room ""Jungle Temple"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-boise-jungle-adventure,0,"We (my wife, son and daughter) did the Jungle Room. It was a first for all of us. We had a great time figuring out the puzzles and putting together all the clues. Team work is key, where one person might be struggling, someone else would swoop into to save us. I think we finished with 7 minutes to spare. Lots of fun, we'll go again!!"

We completed the room with no hints and almost 15 minutes to spare. The puzzles were varied and engaging. Naomi was our host and explained the room and all the salient facts extremely well. We were so stoked when we left, we wanted to do another room right then. Will be back again!"
