We had 4 in our group and it worked out good, I think with to many people it would have tight. Lots of puzzles to solve so dont waste any time! "

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-escape-game-dallas-prison-break,3,We have played four rooms in different locations around DFW area and this was the BEST we have played yet. The prison set was awesome and that really adds to the experience. The game also flowed well and the clues connected - my only tip is to go fast as there are several puzzles to solve. Our game guide was great as he gave us hints and not the answer. We almost made it - just 1 minute more and we would have escaped. This set the bar high! I think this would be best experienced with 4 people total (6 max) so try to go in an off time.  We can't wait to try the others!
