"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/Breakout-Nashville-Casino-Royale,3,I knew within a few minutes that this wasn't my cup of tea. The casino one I had no idea how to play any of the games! I personally enjoyed the escape in nashville better.

I've had the opportunity to try two different rooms with two different ""game masters"" they were both a lot of fun and really engaging without making things too easy on us. This is a great experience for team building or a fun night out! Love it!!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/Breakout-Nashville-Casino-Royale,6,"I love escape games. We have played many of these games at different locations so of course we had to try the Breakout Nashville recently, and we had a great experience both times we went.The first time we were there we did Casino Royal. The Game Master was great. Explained everything very well and had a great attitude. The room was fun; however, I must say that I think the room is for 4 to max 6 people instead of 8. There were a couple times that some of us had to step back and didn't see what was going on because there were too many people in the room. None the less, we still enjoyed it.The 2nd room we played was the Kidnapping. That was a very fun experience. The handcuffs and the blind folds were the finishing touch and made it extra fun.Both rooms were challenging enough but not too hard.We will be there soon to play the Museum Heist and we can't wait for the Island escape to open."

Two hours after breaking out and we still can't stop talking about it. Very fun and challenging - we had an absolute blast! Can't wait to come back to do the other rooms!
