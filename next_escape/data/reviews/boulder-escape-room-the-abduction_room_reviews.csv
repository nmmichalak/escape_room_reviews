"Escape room ""The Abduction"" by Boulder Escape Room in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/boulder-escape-room-the-abduction,1,This was a great experience. We did the Alien Abduction with 6 strangers and made it out with 6 minutes to spare. The staff member was polite and helpful and gave us a great rundown before the start of the game. I'll definitely swing by if I'm ever in the area again. Hope they're all as fun and worthwhile as this one was.
