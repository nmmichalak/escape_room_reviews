"Escape room ""Superheroes Adventure"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-superheroes-adventure,0,Had a blast in the Super Hero room celebrating our daughter's 13th b-day with her friends. Challenging and well put together! Using all our hints we made it out with 4 minutes to spare. Highly recommend! Can't wait to try the other rooms.

We all had so much fun and could not stop laughing our way through the Superhero escape room. Highly recommend for a night out with friends or as a team builder.

It was more fun that I have ever I imagined. Good thing I had a bunch of nerds with me to get it done with 10 minutes left. Thank you Alex and team for the great birthday celebration.

I was a bit anxious as didn't really know what to expect! Did the superhero room with some friends for my husbands birthday. It was such a giggle! Josh was a great moderator, without his hints we would surely never have got out of there! Highly recommend it! We got out with just 32 seconds to spare so it was a close one! Very cleverly put together"

Their set up is clean and super challenging and fun! I've done the Japanese room and last night we did the Superheroes room! Loved both rooms so much!!! Never made it out of the Japanese room but did make it out of the superheroes room with 22 mins to spare! Can't wait til they get another room going...I will definitely be trying my escape skills to break out
