Death by Chocolate has incredibly well-thought out clues that take time and ingenuity to figure out. The workers were very nice and talked to us about their business as well. I love that it's a local establishment that creates everything themselves. The puzzles, clues, and props are all made by them. We will definitely be returning to attempt the Dark Carnival next."

The owner was so welcoming and very engaging. We did the Death by Chocolate room, which was fun with a huge variety of clues and interactions. I'll definitely go back for the Dark Carnival room and the other rooms listed on the website sound super cool, too!"
