It was my first time to play this game, so when we went into the little Alice in Wonderland room, I felt a tiny bit of angst but the room was totally comfortable and our host explained that we could leave at any time. So, our family became totally focused on the fun of deciphering the clues. I am definitely going back and want to do any and all of the games they have and will come up with in the future."
