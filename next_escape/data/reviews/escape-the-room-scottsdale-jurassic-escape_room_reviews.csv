"Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-scottsdale-jurassic-escape,0,"We did The Dig and Jurassic Escape. Both werr great! Ive never done these before and was honestly blown away with how smart the puzzles were. The only complaints I have is both were for 10 people ( our party had 5) and it felt like 10 was way too many people. In both rooms it really felt like maybe 4 or 5 clear leaders took the reigns, 3 people helped and at least 2 people were completely useless and either got in the way or stood in the corner probably not enjoying themselves. The rooms really should be capped at 8. Also there should be an option to book a room as adults only or kid friendly. I can see for adults who've paid the money and are really into doing the puzzles, having to let little Timmy unlock the box or push the buttons or have a turn reading clues is just obnoxious and ruins the experience they played for. There should be like Escape the Room Junior for kids (of appropriate age) so that anyone who books that knows what they are signing up for. Likewise, being the only kid in a group where you might mot know everyone in the party is awkward for the kid and really opens up the door to awkwardness if your kid isn't totally well behaved or is competing with random adults to solve a part of the puzzle."

The quality of the room was fantastic. The sound effects, props, etc. I really enjoyed the storyline and found parts to be challenging. We were grouped with 5 other people, as the rooms accommodate groups up to 10. If you prefer to be with people you know, I'd recommend looking into it. The personalities of others you don't know can be overwhelming and squander the experience at times.Our room guide/host would offer assistance at times, but her timing was somewhat frustrating. I understand escaping the room isn't meant to be spoon fed, although timelier guidance would've been appreciated. Overall a fun night out and we'd consider coming back again."

The room was a bit more simple design wise than I thought it would be, but it was still complex and pretty difficult! We rented the whole room for our party of 8, which while expensive that meant we could work together as a group and not have to worry about having someone we didn't know in the group.I highly suggest it though! It was a lot of fun and really made us think hard!! We were part of the 18% that beat the clock!"
