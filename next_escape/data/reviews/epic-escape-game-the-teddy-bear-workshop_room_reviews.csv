We came as a family and did the Teddy Bear Room. It was awesome to find something we could all do and enjoy some good family time together. It was cool, something different, made us work as a team, and perfect for every age. Our group ranged in age from 7-39 years old and no one ever felt left out or unable to participate. Highly recommend this memorable experience and can't wait to go try out another!"
