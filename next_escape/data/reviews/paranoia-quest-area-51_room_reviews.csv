"Escape room ""Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-area-51,0,"The Good:. I booked the alien encounter for my daughters and two friends in Sept 2016. They enjoyed it very much. They had a few ""scares"" and creepy moments which delighted them, and the puzzles made them think outside the box. They had to work together and really think things out which really was cool. The staff member (only met one) was incredibly nice. We all filled out the liability waiver before arriving but it didn't go through apparently and we had to do it again, this could pose a problem for under aged minors who need parental consent. You may want to call to ensure all is well before bringing kids that don't belong to you. There were two other groups there that said they also filled waiver out online and it didn't ""stick"".Downside: other escape rooms have monitors in lobby so those not participating can watch their party. I just had to sit there for an hr. would have been nice to watch them. Also, 5pts area is a hell hole. I just wish this wasn't in such a bad part of town. Two of the girls went back to car before starting and were approached by two different men trying to talk to them. No way would I want them down there alone and after hearing this, I wanted to shoot myself for letting them go back to car alone. Once inside Paranoia we felt safe, but walking from car not so much. I did see several APD through window while inside."
