I have been to dozens of escape rooms across several states and this one takes the cake. There is unique rooms and creative puzzles. You won't find another escape room like this. The staff made you feel like you were family. Not a single complaint, still on the adrenaline rush."
"Escape room ""Escape In Space"" by 321 Escape Rooms in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/321-escape-rooms-escape-in-space,1,Super awesome experience! I came with a group of 3 others and we did the Space themed room and I have to say it is one of my all time favorite rooms. Very well decorated and immersive and a very challenging game. The staff is very friendly and welcoming and overall we had a wonderful time. Will absolutely be back to try the other rooms.

The theme was incredible and I felt like I was actually in space. This room was challenging, but we managed to make it out! The staff was super friendly and welcoming, and the location was awesome as well. Will definitely be coming back to try some of the other rooms. Thanks for all the help Tammy!"

We were short a few steps from escaping the meteor shower, but had a great time! My husband and I and our 10 and 12 year old daughters had to work together to get to the emergency pod to escape the giant meteor headed for our space lab. Good family fun without the cell phones was really nice! The staff there was kind and helpful! We will be back with success next time!"
