"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-bank-heist,0,I went to the Bank heist at the Redmond quest factor place and had the best time celebrating my boyfriends birthday! It was really exciting to try to cooperate with each other with all these clues and tricks that the room had in store. I 100% recommend the Redmond quest factor and I would love to come again!

They did the Bank Heist! I was so impressed with everything there! This was our very first escape room and it was amazing, it looked like a real bank, and with the help of the very nice gentleman working there they solved it. Was super fun and now we want to go back. The facility was perfect for a party and very clean! Loved everything about it and the kids had a Blast!!!!"
