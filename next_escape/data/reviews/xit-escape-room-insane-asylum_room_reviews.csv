We did the Asylum and it was challenging, but Cristol gave us helpful hints and we got out with 6 minutes to spare! It was so much fun and itâ€™s a place that I will recommend to anyone I know coming down to Gulf Shores."

All of us except one had done an escape room before, but this was our first time at this location. The lady at the front desk was very nice and helpful. The room was challenging, but not ridiculous. We had a great time, we escaped with time to spare, and if we are in the area again, would love to try another room."
