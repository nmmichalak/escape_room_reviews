Eian was awesome as he made the game enjoyable yet challenging with our few hints. We took on the Hostage room and it was extremely lifelike. No spoilers here - if you ever had an interest, you need to try them first! Run by true professionals. Thank you for making our first experience one to remember."

Visited my friend earlier this month. Her, her daughter and myself did the Hostage room. This was my first escape. Jordan was so fun, he was helpful and funny and really encouraged us when we weren't doing so well. We made it out with 4 minutes to spare! The clues were very clever and their use of electronics was so inventive! Great fun!"
