"Escape room ""Bomb Squad"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-bomb-squad,0,"This was our first attempt at an escape room and we loved it! The young lady out front was very friendly and kept us engaged until it was our turn to enter.We entered the room as FBI agents charged with defusing a bomb. Within minutes we were impressed at the cleverness behind the set up. The solutions to the locks/puzzles/traps were expertly hidden in the room, sometimes in plain sight. When we were completely stumped, help was available in the form of gentle nudges in a different direction.We didn't beat the room and blew up, but it was still great fun. I can't wait to go back and try the other room concepts. Definitely five stars with special credit to the friendly staff and genius design."

This was not the first escape room that my husband and I have done, but it was the best one so far! We brought family with us this time around and had a private party of 8. We all want to go back and try another room soon! We escaped the Bomb Squad room with 3 mins and 20 seconds left on the clock. The clues where great, the staff was VERY helpful and super nice! Our experience was amazing! Thank you!"

I appreciated the option to make my game public. It gave us a chance to meet new people and have more brain power working towards our goal. I don't think I would have escaped without them! Bomb Squad was much better than the other escape rooms I have done, the puzzles were challenging but when we did it, we felt pretty darn good about ourselves. I highly recommend this location and I look forward to the next themes."
