My group did the Time Bomb room...so much fun! Challenging, yet we escaped with about 7 minutes to spare. Encourages problem solving, teamwork, and cooperation...highly recommend this as a fun group date night or girls night out. We will be back!"

You know he's an actor, but boy oh boy do you get your money's worth with this added element of fright! Very creative puzzles and overall Hollywood style environment! Can't wait to do the other themed rooms!"

Patient Zero with the real monster in the room added an extra level of excitement. Be prepared to run! We were able to complete it with only 3 or so minutes left. Cant wait for the Time Bomb room.
