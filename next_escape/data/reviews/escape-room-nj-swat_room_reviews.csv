Solved a lot of challenging puzzles and had a great time doing it. Sorry, NYC, but you blew up. Can't wait to come back. Thank you, Grasso and Associates, for arranging this outing! Really want to try ""the other side""."

It's both innovative, challenging & exciting. There was never a dull moment. 2 of us came from Florida to visit and agreed we would want to do this again when we come back"
"Escape room ""S.W.A.T."" by Escape Room NJ in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-room-nj-swat,4,"What an amazing experience! Our game master, Shane was incredible. He definitely helped make it more fun and enjoyable. He was very informative yet friendly. He didn't just say ""here's the room, go in"". We have been to quite a few escape rooms in NY and NJ and Shane is quite possibly the best game master we have come across! We did the swat room and, not for nothing....it was a tough room. Needless to say, we blew up! We managed to get through 80% of the room. We are definitely coming back!"
