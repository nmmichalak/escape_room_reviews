"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/zombie-lab-la,5,"Our second visit, we played both of the new rooms, and enjoyed them both immensely! Very tough, especially the zombie room, but also really clever and well thought out. I love these rooms!!"
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/zombie-lab-la,6,"Such a great experience, we've been twice (bunker and zombie) and can't wait to go again! The rooms have great production quality, a wide variety of clues, and are interactive so the whole group can participate and enjoy. The theming is great and the staff is friendly and helpful. The zombie room was harder than the bunker, so I'd suggest starting with the bunker or asking the staff which room to book if you haven't played before. They're very helpful and will help you find a room that's a good fit for your group."
