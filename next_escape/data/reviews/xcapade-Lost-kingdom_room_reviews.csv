"Escape room ""Lost Kingdom: Distorted Truth"" by Xcapade in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/xcapade-Lost-kingdom,0,"We tackled the Lost Kingdom room- the room had some good challenging puzzles, and some unique ones as well.On the downside, the website and automatic emails are plagued with spelling and grammatical errors, which doesn't instill much faith from the outside. Similarly, a number of the items in the room are in disrepair, misspellings are crossed out and corrected- which kind of takes you out of the moment, one of the UV lights we were given was basically useless because of how dim the light was...In summary, a well designed, challenging room, but not as professional of a company as say Omescape."

The owners are absolutely wonderful, and clearly love what they do. The room itself was fantastic, and the puzzles were the perfect level of challenging! I'll definitely be returning soon."
