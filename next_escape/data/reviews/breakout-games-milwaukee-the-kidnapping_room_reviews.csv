"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-the-kidnapping,0,My family and I had an excellent experience at Breakout! Kyrstyna was our game master and she was great. It was for my birthday and we greatly enjoyed the Kidnapping Room. Great experience!
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-the-kidnapping,1,"So, I broke out. Well, in real life at least.This was my first time doing an 'escape room' and I was kind of nervous going into it. I wouldn't say I have a bad case of claustrophobia and can manage it well. But sometimes it sneaks up on me when I least expect it and I get thrown into a mini panic mode. So that's what really prevented me from doing them.However, Breakout dispels this with letting me know right away that the door is always unlocked in case you need it. It's also good to know there is a game-master or someone that's watching. Maybe that's how it is everywhere, but I was really glad to learn this.Putting the anxiety fears to rest, this was a blast! We did one of the hardest rooms, the kidnapping room. I won't give out any details because you ought to try it yourself! It's great for team bonding exercises or really putting your friendship with your close friends to the test. Takes a lot of cohesion to conquer the room and get out in time (you have an hour).FYI -- you can reserve a room for just you and your group. Or, there is the chance you'll work with other groups as well. Our group of 4 was the only group in the room, but I wouldn't have actually minded working with strangers. It's a cool social experiment!All in all, we got close (had 1 clue left before running out of time), but if we worked together a bit better, I think we would have beaten it. So my advice -- remain calm, work together and have fun!"

We made it out of both and we had such a blast! The rooms were well designed, challenging, and our game master Miah made it even more of a blast! Can’t wait to try out more rooms and come back soon!"

The only disappointing thing was that it was just one room but it was definitely challenging still."

Definitely something different to try if you're looking for something new!"
