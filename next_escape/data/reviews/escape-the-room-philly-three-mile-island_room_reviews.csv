"Escape room ""Meltdown"" by Escape the Room Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-the-room-philly-three-mile-island,0,Went tonight and had a great time! The Meltdown was my team's first Escape game and it was challenging yet stimulating. We had four people on our team and escaped just under the wire.  We left hours ago and are still talking about our experience. What a wonderful place! Shout out to Ciera for being a great team lead.

It seemed like the whole time they were just making it up as you went. The room overall was just frustrating and had a weak finally where we just felt like, is that it?"

Meltdown was more fun than the Dig, because there were more things happening at once, so everyone could be involved doing different activities. The Dig seemed to be too small for the 10 people we booked in -- would recommend it for smaller groups."

We solved it with six seconds left to spare. I'll definitely do it again with the other challenges and everyone had a good time."
