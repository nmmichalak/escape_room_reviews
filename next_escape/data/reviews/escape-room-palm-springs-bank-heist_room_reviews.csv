Took our 2 kids (age 10 and 13) and the entire family had a great time. We did the bank heist room which was quite challenging, but we received a lot of helpful hints form Eevee. She was very supportive and gave us just enough clues to “break the vault” with 4 minutes remaining.  We would definitely recommend the escape room here and hope to return in the near future."

Merlin's room is tech-friendly while the Bank Heist is keys and locks. Both rooms were fun but we absolutely LOVED robbing a bank!The staff and owner are so friendly and helpful! Plus you can't beat the price. Highly recommend
