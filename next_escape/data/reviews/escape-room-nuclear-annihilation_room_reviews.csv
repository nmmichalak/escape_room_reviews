"Escape room ""Nuclear Annihilation"" by Escape Room Madness in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-room-nuclear-annihilation,0,"I researched a few escape rooms for a night out with a friend. I was looking for somewhere close to Herald Square and this location is about a block from Manhattan Mall. This was a great choice and we had so much fun! We'd never done an escape room before. By the time we arrived, the additional 10 people who signed up were waiting for us to come in!We did the Nuclear Annihilation room. If we had 5 more minutes, we could've escaped the room. There were so many puzzles, sounds, combinations to find. That hour you're allotted flies by! We enjoyed it and will likely do so again."
