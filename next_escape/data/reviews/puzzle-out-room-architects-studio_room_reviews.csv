"Escape room ""Architect's Studio"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-architects-studio,0,"We had an amazing time tonight. We chose the Architect's studio. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, especially Carol! She took her time explaining the story and gave excellent hints. The room was very clean, there was a place to hang coats, and there were bottles of hand sanitizer around for us germophobes lol. The game was super challenging and even though we failed the mission (pretty badly lol) we had a great time full of laughter, confusion, and cheers. Can't wait to do it again! Thanks for a great time!"

We were a group of four and it was our first time ever doing a puzzle/escape room and we still haven't stopped talking about it! We made it out with 53 seconds remaining!!! The puzzles are so clever. The owner is so friendly and very welcoming! Highly recommend doing this experience!

Checked out both locations, in Hoboken and Jersey City, and had a great time at each place. You can't go wrong going to either location. Great alternative to the typical night out. Skip the movies and go here!"
