The magician one is crazy. So much stuff going on but the group came through and we busted out!At first, I thought it would be easy, but it took 10 of us to actually get out. The riddles, questions, puzzles, clues are too intense. It really makes you think.Great experience and good price."

"Escape room ""Vanished"" by Epic Escape Rooms LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/epic-escape-rooms-li-vanished,2,Cat and Ephraim made the night awesome for our youth group. We chose the magic themed room which turned out to be the right amount of challenge for our middle age school kids. The hosts were incredibly nice and quick to help us the second we needed more clues and were very patient and helpful to us. The location is pretty unassuming from the outside so we would have never known there was a such a cool spot right near us. Will definitely come back to check out the other rooms and they said they are building more rooms as well. Thanks for a great night!

We tried the Vanished room and had a great time! It's a must try, they were very helpful and it was very creative!"
