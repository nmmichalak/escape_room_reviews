"Escape room ""Arcade"" by Escape Era in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-era-arcade,0,"Definitely one of the best and most memorable escape rooms in the SD area. A mix of really good set design and fun, interesting puzzles made it an unforgettable experience. "
"Escape room ""Arcade"" by Escape Era in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-era-arcade,1,This was a really fun escape room once we were there. The puzzles were great and creative and it was good for a big group. May not be ideal for someone with mobility challenges. Very fun time all the kids loved it. The booking was complicated as no one could really answer questions. I booked for a teen party. Things weren't transmitted from the booking to the facility. A little frustrating but the puzzles were great.

I came here with 5 of my friends for some fun, and boy did we find it. The building is quietly tucked away in Sorrento Valley and pretty easy to get to. Upon arrival, we were very happily greeted by Zoe and her partner in crime. They gave us the full disclosure and all of the info we needed to fully enter the room we were going to escape from. We had an hour like most folks and that was just enough time for the 6 of us to find our way through the various puzzles (with several hints from the awesome duo up front). Highly recommend the arcade room while they still have it!"
