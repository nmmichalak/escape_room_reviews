"Escape room ""The Smokin’ Gun"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-the-smokin-gun,0,"We booked this experience in December for our planned family trip to Vegas the last week in January (thankfully missed the really cold weather back home in Indiana) There were 4 of us in the group (age range from 43 - 75). When we arrived we were greeted by the staff who were all very friendly and helpful. This was our first experience with attempting an escape room. We were informed that we had picked the most difficult room available and for the next 90 minutes, we discovered how true this was. Periodically, we were given 'hints' by one the characters to help aid us in 'finding our way out'. Regretfully, we were unable to 'escape' in the allotted time, but we were shown the remaining clues needed to escape. We all agreed that we would do it again!! There 2 other escape rooms. Next time out we are planning on doing another room. Well worth the price of admission."
"Escape room ""The Smokin’ Gun"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-the-smokin-gun,1,I came into town to visit family for the holidays who planned an escape room adventure. It was my first escape room and it definitely won't be my last! We did the Smoking Gun Escape Room. I dont wanna give away any spoilers but the theme was awesome and it was very interactive. The puzzles and hints really make you think and you really get into it. 10/10 would do again. Can't wait to try another!
