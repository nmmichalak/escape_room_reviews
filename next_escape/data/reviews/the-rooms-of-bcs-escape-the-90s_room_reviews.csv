"Escape room ""Escape the 90's"" by The Rooms of BCS in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/the-rooms-of-bcs-escape-the-90s,1,Such a great afternoon of fun. The staff was friendly and helpful! The 90's room was just as I remembered the 90's!!!
"Escape room ""Escape the 90's"" by The Rooms of BCS in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/the-rooms-of-bcs-escape-the-90s,2,"We did the 90s themed escape room with a few friends for my wife's birthday. While it isn't a bunch of 90s trivia, a lot of the puzzles are themed around 90s stuff. The puzzles were creative, fair, and properly reset unlike some of the other local rooms. The attendant is really involved because his hints weren't just giving us answers but instead were a small suggestion based on a problem we had. We blitzed through... Guess the puzzles were just our cup of tea. Can't wait to go back!"
