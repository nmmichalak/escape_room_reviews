"Escape room ""Curse of the Tiki Lounge"" by Kauai Escape Room in Kauai",https://worldofescapes.com/kauai/quests/kauai-escape-room-curse-of-the-tiki-lounge,0,Really well done and challenging rooms!  We just had a family vacation in Kauai and did 2 rooms while vacationing. Such a great whole family experience. I loved the Tiki room theme. We've done a lot of escape rooms in a lot of cities and these hold up with the best.

Did the scientist room earlier this year, and just did the new Curse of the Tiki Lounge. Both rooms are incredibly fun with fantastic decor to make the entire experience believable."

We barely solved the mystery in time! Highly recommend for great date night, rainy day activity or just fun with friends! We'll definitely be back for the other stories!"
