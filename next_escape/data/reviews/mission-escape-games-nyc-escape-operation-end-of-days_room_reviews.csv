We had a party of 6 for Operation End of Days, which has a max size of 8. With 6 it often felt like there wasn't enough for everyone to do something, and we finished with 17 minutes to spare and no hints."

This was great (although easy for me. I have done over 30). The design was great and it was beautiful to save the world.

I've only done two other escape rooms before, but this was by far the best I've ever done. My friend and I did the new room ""Escape Operation End of Days"". The storyline was great and the effects and technology in the room were the best I've seen. On top of the actual room experience, the staff were fantastic. Our room ""director"" provided the perfect amount of guidance and when I had to reschedule the date of our appointment the staff on the phone was gracious and understanding. 5/5 would recommend."
