"Escape room ""An Hour to Kill"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-an-hour-to-kill,0,Really fun room!! One of my favorites Ive ever done. Its not scary at all (I dont do scary rooms)...and I loved the puzzles.  They were really fun to solve and everything was so well thought out
"Escape room ""An Hour to Kill"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-an-hour-to-kill,1,"When my brother came to visit, one of the items on his list of things to try while here was an escape room. We chose the ""An Hour to Kill"" room. We had such a great time! The James Bond/spy theme of the room really stands out in all the great details they built into the room's layout. From the moment we started we were laughing and enjoying our race to get out in time. We did it with a team of four people, and we had so much fun we went and did a second escape room, ""The Lab,"" right after."
"Escape room ""An Hour to Kill"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-an-hour-to-kill,2,Best exit type game we've been to. High variety of puzzles. Very cool. We've played the villains lair and an hour to kill. Both were amazing. Would come back to try the other ones.
