"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-agency,0,"We were a group of five and we did the Agency. We ended up escaping in 35 minutes and that was the fastest time for this week so we were pretty stoked. There were various puzzles and we each seemed to excel in different places. I will definitely be back to try the Hideout soon. On a side note, the Agency is not a scary room so if you get spooked easily this room is perfect for you. It is mysterious but not scary."

"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-agency,2,I loved how the puzzles are mentally challenging and fun at the same time. You get the clues and it's not a give away. You still have to figure out what they really mean which makes it more exciting. Will definitely come back here once the new room is available! Great job Arcane!
