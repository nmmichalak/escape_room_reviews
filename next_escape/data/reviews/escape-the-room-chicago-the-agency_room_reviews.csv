"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Escape the Room Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-the-room-chicago-the-agency,1,My family got together during a visit from out of state relatives and we did the Agency escape room. We had a lot of fun. It was a little too dark for us older ones but the teenagers were able to help us out. The staff were very nice and helpful. We managed to escape with a few minutes to spare so we were very pleased! We all definitely want to do another one.
