"Escape room ""The Office"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-office,0,"I came here for a work team building. It was so much fun! You enter a room where mostly everything is touchable, meaning you can play around with items and find hidden clues. I did the ""Office"" room, but they have many other room options. The staff is SUPER fun and helpful. Can't give away anymore details..."

It was a very interesting time to see a virtual game turned into reality. I just wished that the prices went lower with more guests. We got out of the room about 15 seconds shy of 57 minutes. There were ten of us, and we pretty much attacked the room without conversing about what we should do first - which kinda confused some people because the clues weren't found in a cohesive manner. We did the Office, and successfully escaped anyway! I will definitely do the other places, but with fewer people and a better game plan."

""The office""!! So in fact we all needed to escape lol.So no spoilers! If you're looking for clues or tips you won't find it here!!The puzzles are engaging and not very clear. You definitely need the max number of people so you have that many extra eyes and extra brains to work on clues. Lastly you need not force any puzzles, everything will make sense if you think about it long enough!"

It's been a full 24 hrs later and I'm still rueing our defeat.  I considered giving them just 1 star to spite them for our failure, but in the end, I guess we had to own it.  The room beat us.We signed up for ""The Office"".  When they first put us in the room, it looked a bit barren.  ""How could 10 people possibly spend an hour in here??"", I thought.  But, as I quickly learned, you will barely notice the time go by as you race from corner to corner deciphering clues.  I highly recommend this place for a good team outing.  Nice folks and a fun concept.  Well done."
"Escape room ""The Office"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-office,4,"The good, the not so good, and the ugly... The Good: This is a really fun way to spend 90 minutes with family and/or a group of friends. It's unique -- so much more interesting than just going to dinner or to the movies, and it's low-tech: I love that! No texting, emailing, or any other form of electronic communication. Just regular human interaction.The Not So Good: I found the clues to be a little obscure. Making them just a little clearer would not diminish the fun factor and would definitely lower the frustration factor. (By the way, my group solved it.)The Ugly: The decor! We did the ""office"" scenario. Would be great if they would replace the hideous curtains with venetian blinds, go to Craigslist or a closeout store and get some cheap cubicles or desks that look more like they belong in an office. Set up a scenario for ""why you have to get out of the office before the boss gets back"". In other words, working on their setup just a little more thoroughly  would make them look a little more professional."
