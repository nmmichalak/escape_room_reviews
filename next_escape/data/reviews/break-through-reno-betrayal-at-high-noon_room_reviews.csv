"Escape room ""Betrayal at High Noon"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-betrayal-at-high-noon,0,"My family and I have done a lot of Escape Rooms, and this is a 10. Totally our favorite. We had to work together to solve them, and we got it done with 3 seconds to spare. GREAT fun for everyone. No one person solved an entire clue. It took our brains together to figure all the puzzles out. HIGHLY recommend."
"Escape room ""Betrayal at High Noon"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-betrayal-at-high-noon,1,My wife and I went on a date night to check out this escape room out. Overall enjoyed the experience. The clues were slightly confusing. We participated in the western experience. The decorations were good and they have an aspect that separates the group a little which we did like. We took my kids to another escape room on our previous Las Vegas Trip that had way more technology which is why I would only give them a 4 plus the confusing puzzles/riddles. Overall solid fun but could use a little work.
"Escape room ""Betrayal at High Noon"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-betrayal-at-high-noon,2,What a wonderful place! My family and I did the High Noon room and had a great time. The puzzles were really fun and our game master was really great at determining when we were struggling and how to push us along in our game. All I can say is that my family and I will be coming back for their other rooms and are really excited to say that we broke out with two seconds left.

We tried the Betrayal at High Noon which I thought was an awesome room. They split us up into different cells and we had to work to break out of them. Very unique and a fun idea.  We found all the hints/clues were very logical, and we had a great time working out way through the puzzles. I definitely plan on visiting this location again to try out the other rooms!"

We participated in Betrayal at High Noon, 4 of us! I can't say enough good things about this place and cannot wait to try the rest of the rooms. Gets your brain moving! Thanks Llaurel for a great time!"

I thought I might have anxiety and make a scene. But there was nothing to worry about! The game captures your attention immediately. The hour goes by super fast and is a BLAST. Now I am scheduling to go back with family and am sad that there are only 4 scenarios to choose from. If you haven't gone, you need to!!"
