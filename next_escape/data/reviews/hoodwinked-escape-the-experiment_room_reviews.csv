"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Hoodwinked Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hoodwinked-escape-the-experiment,1,We did the Experiment room and had a blast. The clues were hard and difficult to code but all in all it was a great experience. If can get hot in the rooms so I recommend wearing a t shirt. My son also had his birthday here and enjoyed the military room. Really great find for escape the rooms on the UES.

It was just my boyfriend and me and we both loved it. Staff was great and while we were waiting, the front desk lady was talkative and engaging. The waiting area was nicely decorated, clean and fit the theme. Would definitely recommend."

Everyone at Hoodwinked was great and super friendly. It's nice to know this is right around the corner from us in Harlem. We'll be back to take on the harder room next time

Some of the clues were a little rusty and hopefully they will replace/repair them for next time. We would come again and recommend it to friends. Love that it is uptown and we didn't have to schlep to the village to enjoy an escape room."
"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Hoodwinked Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hoodwinked-escape-the-experiment,5,"Took my daughter Brianna, my niece, nephew & my daughter's friends here for her 19th birthday on Saturday 5/20 & the experience exceeded our expectations. We did ""The Experiment"", made it out of the room with a minute & some seconds to spare & we had a ball! This really makes you think & it promotes teamwork. Thank you to the young man who talked with us & filled us in on the history of Hoodwinked Escape, he was so kind, I hate we didn't get his name.If you want to have a good time with family, friends or even co-workers, Hoodwinked Escape is the place to be!Will definitely be back to experience the other rooms! We're already planning our return visit."
