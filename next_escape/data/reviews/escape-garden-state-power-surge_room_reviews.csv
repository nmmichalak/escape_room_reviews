"Escape room ""Power Surge"" by Escape Garden State in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-garden-state-power-surge,0,"Did the Power Surge room today with three adults and one tween and it was fantastic. Very clever, well-designed, and challenging without being frustrating. We didn’t escape but get very far and probably would have finished with another 10 minutes. Can’t wait to go back to try their other rooms!"

My husband and I booked a private room (Power Surge) with our siblings. The puzzles were clever and we were able to escape. We are definitely interested in their other rooms.
