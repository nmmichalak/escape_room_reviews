We didn't escape but were close! Had to use our 3 clues even though we found most on our own! Definitely will be back."

It was awesome! It was tough, but not so hard that we couldn't solve it. We had 10 people, which was great because we all worked together to figure it out! Staff was great! So much fun!"

We completed both rooms and had a blast doing them. I love that they create their own rooms and you can tell a lot of thought has gone into these puzzles. The staff and the customer service is great. Naomi was super polite, friendly, and helpful. Can't wait to come back for Area 52 and Sherlock!"
