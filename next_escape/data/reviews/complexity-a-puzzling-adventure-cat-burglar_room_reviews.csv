"Escape room ""Cat Burglar"" by Complexity: A Puzzling Adventure in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/complexity-a-puzzling-adventure-cat-burglar,0,"A small group of us girls decided this would be a fun activity for a night out. We did the Cat Burglar room and had a blast. The puzzle room was well laid out and clues were well devised. We laughed, worked together and overall enjoyed solving the puzzles. I can't wait to go and try their other room."
"Escape room ""Cat Burglar"" by Complexity: A Puzzling Adventure in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/complexity-a-puzzling-adventure-cat-burglar,1,Awesome experience from beginning to end. This was our first ever escape room. Did the Cat Burglar room with my 12-year-old daughter. She was nervous at first but the staff put her at ease. Fully explained from start to final clue. Still talking about it! Can't WAIT to go back. Daughter wanted to do another same day!

What a great gift!!! We did the Cat Burglar adventure. We completed our task with 3 whole seconds to spare!! I would highly recommend Complexity. Our group age ranged 10-44. I think our 10 year old found more clues than the rest of us! We will be back!!

Clean professional environment with a state of the art communication device in the room, no need to worry about a hand held device. The puzzles were logical and FUN!! We are already planning our next trip."

Michelle was so amazing, she spoke to everyone and answered any questions. We did the Cat Bugler room and it was an absolute blast! 1 out of the 10 in our group had experienced a puzzling room, they explained the rules clearly and everyone said they want to do another room when we left. Amazing job Complexity! Keep those rooms coming!"
