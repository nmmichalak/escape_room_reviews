"Escape room ""Bank Heist 2.0"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exodus-escape-room-bank-heist,1,We decided to stop in on our honeymoon and check out Exodus. On the drive over we were nervous and not sure what to expect. When we arrived we signed our waiver and we're locked up in our room. With teamwork and focusing on each others strengths we were able to escape with just 5 mins to spare. We had an incredible time and are definitely coming back to visit and try the other rooms! Thank you for making our honeymoon unique and unforgettable!

Connor & Nathan were awesome hosts and we can't wait to try the other rooms. It was just the right amount of difficulty for a group of 3-6. We definitely recommend this experience. So much fun!!!
