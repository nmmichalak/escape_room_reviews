"Escape room ""The Serial Killer"" by Castle of Chaos in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/chaos-escape-rooms-the-serial-killer,0,"If you want a truly scary escape room experience this is the place for you! We went and did the Serial Killer escape room and it was hands down the best escape room I've ever done. The atmosphere is creepy the moment you walk in the building, the different puzzles were creative and fun, and all of our interactions with the employees were in character and so terrifying. Seriously so good! We will be going back and doing all of their rooms. I'd suggest going in a group of 3-5 on a weekday so you don't have a room with all 10 people, we had 4 and it was perfect. Have fun, don't get murdered!"
"Escape room ""The Serial Killer"" by Castle of Chaos in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/chaos-escape-rooms-the-serial-killer,1,We had a Awesome time. Took the 11am Rez and booked for the serial killer. No lines and guy was cool explaining everything to us. Was our first time so didn't know what to expect. Think maybe we should have took a easier escape room as it was all our first time. But it was so much fun we wanted to all go back. It was for my sons 15th bday and he had a blast. Will be back.
