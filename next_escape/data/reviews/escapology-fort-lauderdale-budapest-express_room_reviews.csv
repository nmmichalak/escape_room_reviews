Our favorite was Budapest, but both were good. Would definitely go back."

We did the Budapest Express room and it was pretty difficult. However, our game master Francesca was really helpful and engaging, and we definitely won't forget her lol. The place itself is nice and seems fairly new and the staff there were very nice. After failing to get out, Oren explained the whole room to us, he was really patient and answered/explained everything very clearly. I will be going again and would highly recommend them to everyone."

I'm an escape room junkie and I absolutely loved this location. Budapest Express was my favorite game. They had awesome puzzles and a fun atmosphere. They do a fantastic job of immersing you in the story. Very friendly staff and Erica was an awesome game master. I also liked their system for giving clues; it's very efficient compared to other places I've been.  Overall, 10 stars in my book!"
