"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - St. Louis in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/breakout-games-st-louis-do-not-disturb,3,"We played Do Not Disturb with 4 people. It was just as fun as the other one we played, Hostage. We called as we were driving there and they were able to assign us into a room at the last minute and didn't have to wait until the top of the hour to start. Very nice to have been able to play at the last minute."
