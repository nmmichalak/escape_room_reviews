Talk about an amazing staff - dedicated, fun and super original. The designs of the rooms were so exciting. My girlfriend and I are pretty big into escape rooms and The Council was an amazing challenge! The room is an awesome mix of linear and abstract puzzles with both locks and manipulating objects. It was so much fun and incredibly impressive. We cannot wait to get back and try the next rooms, maybe even next weekend!"
