"Escape room ""The Shadow Gallery"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-the-shadow-gallery,0,"We went for the first time last night and had a blast. The game was tough, but still super fun. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable. This is a really cool idea and we will definitely be back. And next time we will get much further in the game."
"Escape room ""The Shadow Gallery"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-the-shadow-gallery,1,"It was our first time and we had 3 people, including a 13 y/o. It was SOOO much fun! We came really close to solving the mystery because we wasted a lot of time on the front end, but even that added to the intrigue. The exercise is intellectual, interesting, and has you thinking out of the box (at least the mystery we chose). It was great and we will be back with friends! It's also so reasonably priced that it's easy to go again and again. Totally recommend it."
