We did the ""Ultimate Heist"" and it was manageable with 8 but pleasantly difficult. Lots of spatial and word puzzles. Would have enjoyed a bit more logic-oriented puzzle solving, but it's overall a fun bonding experience that I'd recommend."

Our host, ""Vinnie"" made the game a lot of fun and he couldn't of been better with his impersonation of a jewelry heist boss!
