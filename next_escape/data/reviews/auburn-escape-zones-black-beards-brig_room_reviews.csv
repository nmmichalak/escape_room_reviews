Even as a new player, I was able to contribute and we successfully escaped the room. When I had gained more experience, we came back for the cabin room and it was a blast. The decor and immersive story really enhance the experience overall and it is my favorite room so far. "

Our group of 8 escaped the Blackbeard room! It seems like the ideal number of people is 5-6 - 8 was a bit chaotic and crowded, but we all had a great time and everyone contributed to the escape. The staff was terrific, very friendly and encouraging. I will definitely go back! Highly recommended!"
