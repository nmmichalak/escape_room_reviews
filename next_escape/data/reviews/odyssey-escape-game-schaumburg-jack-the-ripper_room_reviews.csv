"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper - Solve the Mystery"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/odyssey-escape-game-schaumburg-jack-the-ripper,0,"Done plenty of escape rooms in the past, this one takes the cake by FAR. Extremely professional staff, rooms, and experience. Did the Jack the Ripper Room, felt like we were real detectives! Not just a normal run-of-the-milk “Find the key and escape” but ACTUAL objectives. Going back in a few days, recommend this to anyone looking for a 5/5 experience!"

"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper - Solve the Mystery"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/odyssey-escape-game-schaumburg-jack-the-ripper,2,I have done two of the rooms here (Jack the Ripper and Towering Inferno) and have loved both of them! The attention to detail in the rooms is amazing! I would warn people that I think Jack the Ripper is a hard room (and that is not bad); I just think its harder then their website leads you to believe. Titanic or Towering Inferno is where you want to start if you are new to escape rooms. Odyssey - welcome to Chicagoland! Looking forward to doing your other two rooms!
