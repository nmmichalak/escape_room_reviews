"Escape room ""Carnival Conundrum"" by Just Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/just-escape-carnival-conundrum,0,"There are ""rooms"" everywhere, but it's the little finishes that made this one so good. My family and I (wife and three kids 17, 15 & 5) did the ""Carnival"" room. They have a POPCORN machine, with fresh popcorn made. Come on... brilliant! Our games master, Alyssa, was excellent. It's hard to write a thorough review without giving anything away, so just go!"
"Escape room ""Carnival Conundrum"" by Just Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/just-escape-carnival-conundrum,1,Did the Carnival Conundrum with three friends. We had no idea what to expect! It was much more challenging than I anticipated but we had an awesome time and we made it out with 3 minutes to spare. The staff was also super friendly.

This was soooo much better than another escape room I had done! It was fun to find the clues, playing Carnival games to help us figure it out. The effects were great and loved that we were offered popcorn when we were done!"
"Escape room ""Carnival Conundrum"" by Just Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/just-escape-carnival-conundrum,3,"I've been to plenty of escape rooms, but this was more challenging with little additions to each room that makes it stand out. Most recently adding magnetized entrances and ""magic"" puzzles included hands on but also logic and visual. Plus who doesn't love free popcorn! Makes you feel like Sherlock Holmes."

There were 6 of us. We had the best time ever. Our game master was Ally and she was the best. She explained the game in detail. Our hour begun and so did the laughs. The room was so much fun. The clues made it more fun and as we went along, the competitiveness kicked in and so did the laughs. We all said when we came out that we wanted to do another room soon. I had done an escape at a different venue and it wasn’t nearly as fun. We can’t wait to do it again."
