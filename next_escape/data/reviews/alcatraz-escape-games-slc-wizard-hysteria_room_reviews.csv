"Escape room ""Wizard Hysteria"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-slc-wizard-hysteria,1,This was the first time I went to an escape room. We reserved and paid for tickets online. We picked the wizard escape room because it looked good for a beginner. Each of the family was able to participate in solving different puzzles so everyone had a great time. The people were very friendly and made this a great family experience! I would highly recommend this to anyone.
