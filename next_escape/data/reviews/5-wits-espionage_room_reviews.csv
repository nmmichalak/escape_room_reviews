"Escape room ""Espionage"" by 5 Wits in Syracuse",https://worldofescapes.com/syracuse/quests/5-wits-espionage,0,"My kids(10 and 13) love W-wits. This was our second time here, and we've been to the one in Syracuse too. We did 20,000 leagues under the sea, which probably was my least favorite of the 4 we've done, but it's still a good time. The staff is really good about making sure that all of the kids get a chance to participate... since we had a small group, the parents ended up helping out too. My kids are dying for them to open up a place in Philly."

So basically you choose your theme you get a guide and you might end up with other strangers in your group. You start in a room and then you have to figure out how to get out of it. I recommended people of all ages to try it. There are times that you will have to crawl, and jump over things in the espionage games, and it was so worth it!"
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by 5 Wits in Syracuse",https://worldofescapes.com/syracuse/quests/5-wits-espionage,4,"Really fun, especially when you are lucky enough to end up in a game with only your friends. It's immersive and interactive and it challenges you with puzzles and trying to beat the clock. You really do have to rely on your wits to figure things out. The only drawbacks that I could see is that sometimes you end up with a group of strangers which can be fun, but it depends who you end up with."
