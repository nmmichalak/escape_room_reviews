We have done the Hostage, Museum Heist (favorite) & Operation Casino rooms. Definitely give it a try. It is full of intricate clues & mystery details that are unmatched at any other escape room. We canâ€™t wait to try other rooms or the new ones that they add. Great time, thanks #sunshine you were a fabulous clue master!"

It was fun, we had a group of 6 and it was beneficial that at least one person had been through an escape room previously. The clues were helpful and we probably would not have gotten out without the clues. Fun experience!!"
