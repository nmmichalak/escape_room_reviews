"Escape room ""Date Night: The Missing Starlet"" by Escape Room Wisconsin in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/Escape-Room-Wisconsin-DATE-NIGHT-THE-MISSING-STARLET,0,Loved the experience at Escape Room Green Bay! Our game master was very helpful and even provided us clues when he wasn't necessarily supposed to. I did the Date Night room with a girlfriend which is a 2 person room and we successfully broke out with 10 minutes to spare! I really liked that they played music that fit with the theme of the room for the entire time and the props for pictures afterwards are fun! Can't wait to try the other rooms offered!!

"Escape room ""Date Night: The Missing Starlet"" by Escape Room Wisconsin in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/Escape-Room-Wisconsin-DATE-NIGHT-THE-MISSING-STARLET,2,"Last night we had the pleasure of doing this as our date night. This is by far one of the coolest things I've done. Although we failed our mission we had such a great time. What's unique about this experience is that it really requires you to think outside the box and most of all the use of verbal communication. My husband and I really enjoyed being able to work together and follow each clue. The adrenaline rush is out of this world. I think that the price is worth every penny! Aside from the experience I must say that the two gentlemen working ( I believe they were the owners ) were more than friendly, helpful and really played into the whole experience! This is a must do !!!"
