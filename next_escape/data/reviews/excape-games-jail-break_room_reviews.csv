"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by Excape Games in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/excape-games-jail-break,0,We did the Murder Mystery for 4 last night and escaped! The staff was very helpful and friendly. Can't wait to go back and try jailbreak.

Our group had been to a not-so-great escape room prior to this, but we had an absolute blast. Austin was fantastic in briefing us and giving us some hints along the way. We were a little nervous, as we had the most difficult room (Jail Break), but we managed to escape with 7:11 remaining! The room set up was really fun and interactive, story line was interesting, and the puzzles were a good mix of difficulty. We would absolutely come back to try out the other rooms, and recommend to family/friends!"

Staff is perfect and so much fun! The room itself was challenging and at no point did I feel any of the puzzles didn't make any sense. The flow of Jail Break is perfect. The theme was so perfectly done and I felt immersed the entire time we were in the room, even when the clues are given. Well done everyone and our group will be back very soon to try out all of your other rooms!"
