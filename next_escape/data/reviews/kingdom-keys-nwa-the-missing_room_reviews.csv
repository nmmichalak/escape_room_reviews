"Escape room ""The Missing"" by Kingdom Keys NWA in Centerton",https://worldofescapes.com/springdale/quests/kingdom-keys-nwa-the-missing,0,"Decided to do the Missing escape room with my four young adult (20s) children during their visit for Christmas. It was definately challenging but so much fun. They were initially concerned that it would be all ""Bible stuff."" Most clues were very general, with little to no Bible knowledge required. We didn't make it out, but had so much fun and got pretty close to finding the keys. This would be great for a little family bonding, get together with friends, or even team building."
