"Escape room ""Cutthroat Cavern"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-gate-escape-cutthroat-cavern,0,"This is the first game that we have played at 13th Gate, and we were absolutely blown away by the scenery. In total, there are five rooms that you will be exploring in this game so you must constantly be moving around to escape this game. The puzzles, which there are plenty of, are so much fun, that sometimes you get so lost in the environment that you stop looking at the clock. You can find physical puzzles, logical puzzles, and so much more throughout this game, oh, and I would recommend bringing some extra shoes because its a bit sandy! From start to finish in this game, we had so much fun and are still thinking about it to this day. "

It was fun and realistic, like all the rooms at 13 gates! Ethan (the tall one) was our game master and he was very nice and helpful and made the experience better!!!"
"Escape room ""Cutthroat Cavern"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-gate-escape-cutthroat-cavern,2,"If one must use a single word to describe this game, it would very likely be ""wow"", given the ridiculous amount of detail, breadth, and scope of the experience. Without spoiling particular puzzles, players will get a chance to transform large parts of rooms, witness incredible reveals, and even walk along the artificial shoreline within the titular cavern. The puzzles are in the moderate to difficult range, but it wouldn't be impossible for a newer player to solve. While the puzzles are not particularly inventive, it still is worth travelling quite far to witness the treasures of this cavern."
