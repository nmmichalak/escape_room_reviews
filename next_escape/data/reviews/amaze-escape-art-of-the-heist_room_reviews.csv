Played both rooms, failed one and escaped the other. Both rooms were fun and challenging. Absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a fun experience."
"Escape room ""Art of the Heist"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/amaze-escape-art-of-the-heist,1,We had a ladies night out and learned communication was definitely key.  Awesome brain teasers to pull of the heist! Good for a night with friends or family. Have to try the jail cell room next time!
"Escape room ""Art of the Heist"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/amaze-escape-art-of-the-heist,2,This was great fun. Each one of us enjoyed the heist scenario. The staff was terrific in offering us subtle hints but not giving away the answers so we still had to work out the puzzles. I would highly recommend this as a group outing. To the jail cell next!

The room was the perfect level of challenging and we got down to the wire! Unfortunately, we didn't make it through - five more minutes might have done it! Highly recommend this place."
"Escape room ""Art of the Heist"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/amaze-escape-art-of-the-heist,4,This was so fun! We did the Art Heist with a group of eight. The clues were all well thought out and the variety was great - everyone could take part when different skills were needed. It was also really cool to walk through after and hear about how things worked :) Definitely want to try the other room!
