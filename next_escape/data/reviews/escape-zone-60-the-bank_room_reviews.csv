"Escape room ""The Bank"" by Escape Zone 60 in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-zone-60-the-bank,2,The best things about escape rooms are the puzzles and the people. The Crime Scene Bank Robbery was my fifth escape room and I was worried that I would start to see some of the same clues and puzzles. I was extremely excited to find that all the puzzles and clues were new to me. I loved the challenge. Our host was wonderful. He had a great sense of humor and made sure we had a great time. I can't wait to go back and escape the Asylum.
