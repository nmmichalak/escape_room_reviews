"Escape room ""The Missing Deed"" by Ghostly Manor Thrill Center in Sandusky",https://worldofescapes.com/sandusky/quests/ghostly-manor-thrill-center-the-missing-deed,0,"We spent over 100 dollars on four handed house tickets. 2 3d movies and 2 mystery room escape adventures. The mystery room was something we always wanted to try.We knew the concept of find the clues to unlock the doors and locks.  The fun is in finding the clues.  Your allowed 3 clues. Ur supposed to ask for. We didn't ask for any because,  the fun was sucked out of the whole mystery by what seemed like every 5 minutes (no exageration) we were interrupted by the lady running the game, with long black braided hair and told every answer TO EVERY CLUE and told us in order the SEQUENCE of the MYSTERY OF THE GAME!!! We would just have one more letter to find. We we working on it sooo close when the excitment. Was sucked out of the whole experience over and over. she would come in (without us asking for a clue) and tell us what to do where to look and then to make it worse. She told us the exact combinations to every dang lock! When she asked how we liked it. I told her as kind as I could we appreciated her intentions in trying to help. But that it ruined it for us. She took the entire fun out of  what we paid for. Which was the the fun in finding mystery in the clues and told us every answer!   I expressed that we would have had more fun being left alone to figure it out. If we didn't get it then at the end of the hour to be told. I told her we wouldn't have minded even if we were stuck in the same room for the whole HR. At least we would have had the opportunity to try on our own. Which is what we paid for. She got an attitude even though I told her we appreciated that we knew her intention was to help. But a suggestion for the future detectives lol.  let us ask for it. Even if we were StuckI. One room. No biggy. We felt we would have had more fun then her giving us every single clue. She stormed off saying whatever have a good day attitude which ruined our trip even more. It would have been a blast if it wasn't for her micro managing our entire experience without being asked for her assistance. Before we went. Her attitude at the end made it worse. To top it off. We asked her before doing the games. (We come to this place sometimes when going to cedar poi t so we knew the dragon in the front of the building shot steam from its nostrals . we wanted to get a photo after we We're done with everything in front of the dragon. We asked her if she would please make the steam come out for our family photo to scare a first timer we brought with us. She said she would. But because of my honest answer when she asked how we enjoyed the mystery room. She choose not too.  I honestly. Truly have loved this place since the first visit years ago. But because of her alone( not the mystery. It would have been awesome if we were allowed to try)  we were given such a bad attitude and left with wishing I never spent the money . I hope u get different employees that can understand simple human boundaries. And kindness.  If u do. You will have a blast guaranteed."
