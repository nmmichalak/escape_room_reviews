"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/the-great-escape-room-providence-sherlock-holmes-library,1,My husband and I did Sherlock's Library last night. We were joined by 4 other people whom we did not know. We had a blast! The puzzles were different than any we had ever experienced before. We worked great as a team! And to top it off we beat the existing record for the room! We will definitely go back to try the Gameroom!
