"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Evansville in Evansville",https://worldofescapes.com/evansville/quests/breakout-games-evansville-mystery-mansion,0,"We did the Mystery Mansion today and even though we didn‚Äôt escape, the game was still awesome. I will definitely go back again to try another room. Our game-master Kelsey was awesome too. She provided clues and hints anytime we asked for them. Best and most energetic escape room employee I‚Äôve ever had in any escape room. I would recommend this room to anyone of any age. And the construction going on next door actually added to the game instead of distracting."
