"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by Fort Wayne Escape Room in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/fort-wayne-escape-room-deep-space,0,Our group had a great time! We chose the Deep Space room and escaped with less than 2 minutes left. The obstacles were challenging and the staff was helpful and friendly... plus there was a dog hanging out in the office. We will definitely be back!
"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by Fort Wayne Escape Room in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/fort-wayne-escape-room-deep-space,1,Definitely the best room Iâ€™ve come across so far! The puzzles were fun and the A.I. was a sass queen. If you mess up he will let you know. At one point someone dropped a lock box and it broke open and he nearly gave us a heart attack when he got his revenge. 10/10 would recommend.
