"Escape room ""The Legacy"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-the-legacy,0,This escape room is amazing! I did the Pirate one with the Brainy Actz a few months ago and decided to come back for the Legacy. It was so challenging and a blast! My friend and we were the only two in the room. Taylor who is always at the front desk helping with the escape rooms is incredible! She remembered from our time before! It makes me even more excited to keep coming back.

The Temecula location has a Legacy room that actually integrates story elements from the rooms I've done in Irvine, which was super cool. It really made it seem like the other rooms I've run were still a part of the experience."

From the time making reservations to the finish, the service was great. I think the more people in your group is the better. Thank you, staff, for making our time in the room so enjoyable. Looking forward to our next visit."
