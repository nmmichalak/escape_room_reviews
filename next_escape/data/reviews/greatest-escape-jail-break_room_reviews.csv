Two of us had never done an escape room before, but we made it out! Granted, we needed a few hints, but we had a blast trying to figure everything out! Sometimes we had to step back and try another strategy to solve a puzzle, but that's what makes it fun! I would highly recommend the jail room, and I can't wait to try the apartment!"
