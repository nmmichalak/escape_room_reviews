"Escape room ""Narcos"" by Panic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/panic-escape-room-veronica,1,My family and I just went twice; first was split room and second was Veronica. Both times were very fun. We love how we were submerses in the atmosphere and the challenging riddles and puzzles. Will definitely do it again.
