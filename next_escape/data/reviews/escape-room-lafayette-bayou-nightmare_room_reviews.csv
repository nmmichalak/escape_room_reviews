The Bayou Nightmare room was challenging but so much fun! The game master was very helpful and always gave great clues to help us along the way when we got stuck. I loved how they really made you feel like you were part of the scenario. The room was dark and you could only use flashlights! We will definitely be going back soon to try another room!
