Clever puzzles, great sets with lots of attention to detail. Did the Missing Maestro and The Cabin with a group of friends and family - we didn't quite make it out on time but really enjoyed the experience. The staff is friendly and their timing of hints is perfect. They won't let you get frustrated or stuck, which makes it super fun. This was definitely the most fun I've had in a long time!"
"Escape room ""Missing Maestro"" by Twisted Room Escapes in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/twisted-room-escapes-missing-maestro,3,We did our first escape room tonight and didn't know what to expect. We did the Missing Maestro and it was a lot of fun. You really had to work together and it was cool to see the clues fit together. The enthusiasm that the staff showed really made it a fun time. This is a family owned business and you can tell that it matters to them.
