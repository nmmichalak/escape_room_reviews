"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escaped Las Vegas: ZOE in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escaped-las-vegas-zoe,1,"My family and I just completed this escape room and it was absolutely a blast!! We had a great time. There are 4 different rooms to venture through and figure out puzzles in order to get to the next room. There are live actors as well to add a little enhancement to the ""living in a horror movie"" feeling. I don't want to give too much away, but be sure to close the doors on your way to the next room or you may have some ""followers"":). There was a lot of laughter, and even more screaming (mainly from me...they said I could be heard from the outside...) and my family and I would definitely come again! Thank you for the awesome experience Zoe :D!"
