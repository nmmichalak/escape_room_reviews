"Escape room ""Kings Quest"" by Escape Kings in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-kings-kings-quest,0,We took my 9 year old and 11 year old nieces to the King Arthur room and they had a ball! We solved the room and they were a huge part of the process. Well themed. Great puzzles. And a fun atmosphere. Highly recommend. Even my 4 month old liked it!

We first did the Kings Quest room as a family of 4 (ages 8 & 10) and it was a very child-friendly experience. The room was a bit on the simpler side, which makes for a great first-escape room experience. The kids liked it so much that older one chose to have her birthday party there and they did the Aztec Ruins room, which was a bit more challenging. The kids made it out of that room just in time (with only a little help from one parent in the room). The party room/game room that's included in your party was also a hit, with the ability to play Minecraft, FortNite, Switch games, etc.The owner is really kind and makes you feel comfortable throughout your stay. Would highly recommend visiting this family run business."

The three of us escaped! (Husband, 8-year-old, and myself). Logical and fun. I really recommend it. The staff is wonderful too."
