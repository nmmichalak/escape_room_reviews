"Escape room ""The Pirate's Den"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-pirates-den,1,"I did this room with a group of 3, and felt that it was a good number although the GM told us that it would be more tough attempting this room with such a smaller number of people. We felt that the room was okay overall, good for those who are new to escape rooms. It was literally just locks and keys, as we felt that room didn't have a high production value because some of the clues and props just looked out of place. On top of that, when we were inside the room we could hear people talking really loudly outside, which broke our concentration from the room. We had to ask for hints for certain puzzles because we literally had no clue how to solve them, but overall this is a learning experience that I will be taking with me to the next escape room I do. We escaped with about 3 minutes to spare. "

It was our first trip to a room escape and we had a blast! The puzzles felt complicated yet beatable and there were many different types. The room was immersing and very well designed. Staff was friendly and helpful. I can't wait to go back and try out the Pharaoh room!
