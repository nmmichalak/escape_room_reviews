"Escape room ""Time Pirates"" by Fuzzy Logic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fuzzy-logic-escape-room-time-pirates,0,Our group had a great time working our way through the Time Pirates room(s).  The puzzles were just challenging enough--we'd definitely go back and try another room!  Highly recommend.

My son celebrated his 12th birthday escaping the Time Pirates room. The kids loved it! Puzzles were age-appropriately challenging and the group size (8 plus one adult chaperone) was perfect to split up into smaller teams to work on the clues and puzzles. The rooms were set up with artifacts that touched on different civilizations in history and were really well done. We had such an enjoyable experience that we did the Garage Sale as a family. Much tougher, with one room and puzzles that were much more challenging. Both times, the staff at Fuzzy Logic was really great to work with. Helpful with clues when needed, but didn't interfere if help was not needed. We escaped Time Pirates, but not Garage Sale. Highly recommend for a fun family activity."
