"Escape room ""Sector 8 - Area 51"" by Escape Room Clearwater Beach in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-clearwater-beach-sector-8,2,"We did the Sector 8 (Area 51)  Escape Room. This was my first Escape Room experience and it was awesome. It was three of us in the room and it was very challenging. We didn't make it out in time, but the experience was well worth it. If you get stuck and are or spending too much time at an area where you are not advancing you can ask for a clue. I am looking forward to trying other Escape Room themes. It was fun and exciting. The game controller (can't remember his name) was very welcoming, nice, and helpful especially since this was our first time in an Escape Room."
