"Escape room ""The Lobby"" by Escape It in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/escape-it-the-lobby,0,"Very nice escape room. We did the lobby and were able to escape in time. The rooms were well maintained. Some of the puzzles were very unique and really fun to solve. The live actor/hostage was a nice addition. It was super easy to book online, and the people there were very nice. We look forward to going back to try the elevator."
