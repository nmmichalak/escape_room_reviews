We loved it so much, we came back a second time that night and did Slaughter. And then, two weeks later, I came back again to do Daycare! This place is amazing, the staff are so wonderful and in character all the time. Creepy, yet supportive and just absolute fun to be around. As for the rooms, I can't even explain how wonderfully detailed and well thought out everything is. This is probably one of the best experiences I have had in my life. "

Random scares, and very challenging! I highly recommend this place we're booking for four other rooms to try! I can't get enough!!!"

When you walk up, the employees are all in character as you ""check in"" - the check in process is lengthy, so definitely get there as early as they recommend! They need you to fill out waivers and have your photo taken for a fake passport, which you get to keep (and they stamp if you successfully get out of your room). We did the Daycare room, and it was surprisingly tough, but we got out with 12 minutes remaining. We had fun and would do it again."
