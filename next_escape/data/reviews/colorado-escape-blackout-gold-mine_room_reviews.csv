"Escape room ""Blackout Gold Mine"" by Colorado Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/colorado-escape-blackout-gold-mine,1,What an awesome escape room! I have been to several different companies now but have to say this one was super worth it! As someone who has done a few different styles now I enjoy seeing new and creative takes on escape rooms as well as something with a bit of a challenge. Ariel did a great job welcoming us in and giving us the clues we needed when the time was right. Thanks for a great experience! We will definently be back!

We finished the Black out and immediately asked if we could do another room. So Amber set up another room and we did the heist! It was great!!!!
