"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Green Bay Escape in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/green-bay-escape-asylum,0,"I was part of a group of 4 that completed the Asylum room. The experience was amazing with a great mix of puzzles that all tied together very well, unexpected happenings, and super friendly staff that seemed to really care about escape games as a whole and making sure that the group had a great time while doing the puzzles. I can't wait to go back again and see what else they can come up with!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Green Bay Escape in Green Bay",https://worldofescapes.com/green-bay/quests/green-bay-escape-asylum,1,First time doing this and we did Asylum! The guys who run the place were so sweet to my fiance. He was hesitant to do it with us because of the confined space so they brought him in to see the room and get comfortable with it. Then they let him join our group free of charge!
