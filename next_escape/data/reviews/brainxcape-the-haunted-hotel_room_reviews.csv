It was creepy, fun, challenging and infuriating (but in a good way!) Wish I had brought my ""readers"" though! Clues were helpful and well-timed and it was a great way to spend an hour that kept us talking all night. Highly recommend (also a great neighborhood with tons to do afterward) It was REALLY hard!"

SO much fun and had a great time doing it with my friends! I highly recommend. The decor in the room was so awesome. We just missed escaping by like 45 seconds, but will definitely go back and do the prison and I know we will escape this time!!!"
