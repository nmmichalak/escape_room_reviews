It is highly recommended. They rooms were challenging but oh so fun. Half of us did Meltdown which they escaped and the other half did the Speakeasy, which was hard, but we got through more than half with only 7 people when the room holds 12. The staff were great and the rooms were awesome. Thanks OBXSCAPE."

We were really impressed with this place and the room we did. Love the speakeasy theme and it was perfectly difficult. We will be back!"
