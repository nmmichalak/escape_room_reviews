"Escape room ""Special Agent"" by Escape Room Marlton in Collingswood",https://worldofescapes.com/collingswood/quests/escape-room-challenge-special-agent,1,"My wife, daughters and I thoroughly enjoyed the Special Agent room. It was our first time trying an escape room. We didn't escape, couldn't get the one last clue. The clues given were awesome and if we knew our geography better we would have made it out. A great experience! We will definitely be going again!"
