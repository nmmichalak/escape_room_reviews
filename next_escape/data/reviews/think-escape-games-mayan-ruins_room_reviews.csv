The room was so well done I can't stop taking about it. The puzzles, the room, the decor...all very cool. It's a great option even if your group is on the smaller side, like our team of four. Fun outing for friends, family or work team building."

Puzzles were great and the visual theme was even better. Would definitely recommend to all.

It was a little challenging for my 11 and 13 year old grandchildren, but with a little support, we made it through to the end. Iâ€™d definitely recommend the Mayan experience."
