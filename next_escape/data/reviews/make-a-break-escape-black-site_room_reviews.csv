"Escape room ""Black Site"" by Make a Break Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/make-a-break-escape-black-site,0,"Black Site was my fourth escape room in the bay area, first at Make a Break, and I loved it. The game master was awesome and we made it out (through a lot of rewarding effort) with two minutes to spare. It was an awesome challenge. Can't wait to go back."
