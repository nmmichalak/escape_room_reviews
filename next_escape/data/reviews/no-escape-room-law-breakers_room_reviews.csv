"Escape room ""The Law Breakers"" by No Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/no-escape-room-law-breakers,0,"What an awesome time doing the Law Breakers challenge at No Escape! My friend and I finished with four seconds on the clock. The challenges were intricate and plentiful. Walking into the business suite can take you for a trip, but you will not be disappointed! We'll be back to do the other escape room. Our game master was Diana- lots of fun, good hints without being too obvious. Great job!"

I loved the experience and will be coming back. We had Jay for our game master, and he was awesome. He was so fun and nice and made the game a blast. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a new exciting activity to try with friends and family."

We had never done anything like this before and at first glance, the room we were brought into didn’t look very exciting. But once we started playing we had so much fun! Jay was the employee who helped us and he was funny, helpful, and did not make us feel bad for asking for hints every now and then. We did Law Breakers in 59 minutes with a few hints and are already looking forward to going back to do the police room and try to get a better time."
