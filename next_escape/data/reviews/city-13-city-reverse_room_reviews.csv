"Escape room ""City Reserve"" by City 13 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/city-13-city-reverse,0,"Incredibly fun, brilliant, challenging - City 13 takes escape rooms to the next level. When you first walk in, you'll encounter a city-like rec room, great for hangouts or parties. We did the City Reserve escape room, which was so cleverly put together with a number of amazing technologies to interact with. We had a group of very bright people and still couldn't quite escape, but this is the more challenging room. However, figuring out these puzzles is so rewarding and fun, and it's a great way to build teamwork. Definitely check them out!"
