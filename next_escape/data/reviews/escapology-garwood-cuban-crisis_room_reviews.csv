"Escape room ""Scooby-Doo"" by Escapology Garwood in Garwood",https://worldofescapes.com/garwood/quests/escapology-garwood-cuban-crisis,0,"We played the Antidote escape room this evening and it was fantastic. This is the second time we have gone, the first time we played Cuban Crisis. Both are equally wonderful and the staff truly goes above and beyond to make sure you understand everything and have a great time."
"Escape room ""Scooby-Doo"" by Escapology Garwood in Garwood",https://worldofescapes.com/garwood/quests/escapology-garwood-cuban-crisis,1,This was such a great experience! I went here with a group of 6 to do an escape room for my birthday and we were in for a good time. The persons who greeted us were nice and cordial and explained some of the process to us. The entirety of the experience in one word? ORGANIZED. They really take pride in that and it's visible. We did the Cuban Crisis mission and enjoyed ourselves and made it out with less than ten minutes to spare. I would go back

Game Host Ally and Game Master John were awesome! The owners were fabulous to work with in planning. The room was challenging, fun, and surprising. Highly recommend!"
