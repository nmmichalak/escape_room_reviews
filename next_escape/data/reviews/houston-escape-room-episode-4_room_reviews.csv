It was a lot of fun, they had creative puzzles and clever clues! I work at an escape room in Nashville and these guys know how it's done! A lot of fun and would recommend to anyone new or experienced!"

This is my third room. Most of our team, of 10, were first timers, not knowing what to expect and they enjoyed it. We escaped it with 3 minutes and 12 seconds left. The staff is pretty chill and laid back."

We worked together and made it out with less then a minute remaining. The staff were FANTASTIC. The girl in our room was professional, calm and seemed to enjoy us running around like maniacs! I would do it again in a heartbeat!"
