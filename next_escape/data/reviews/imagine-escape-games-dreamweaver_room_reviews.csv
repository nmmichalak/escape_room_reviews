"Escape room ""DreamWeaver"" by Breakout's Imagine Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/imagine-escape-games-dreamweaver,0,"We make at least one trip a year from NC to FL and ALWAYS visit Imagine. We were excited to try their newest foray into their serial unfolding storyline: Dreamweaver. We also had not done the prelude, Alleyway Vigilantes, so did that one 1st. They were both amazing! AV, being their ""introductory"" room was impressive, full of great surprises and puzzles, and a really FUN room! Dreamweaver, being their newest, and hardest, was also excellently executed. Everyone had something to do, and you really felt the time crunch in this one. They had two amazing logic puzzles I ended up working on myself and just had a blast. Our GM, Aaron, provided excellent help and subtle hints when we needed one. He was fun, quirky, and obviously loved working there. Can't wait to the next chapter and our next visit!!"

The room flowed well and the puzzles were very fun to do. Our game guide was hilarious and awesome to work with. We will be back to do the other three rooms. :)

An excellent room facilitator from start to finish, maybe the best I've ever had in several years of doing escape rooms! The room itself was super fun and very well designed. We were lucky enough to take the 3rd place spot on the winners wall too üôåüèª Highly recommend!"
