"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Mission Manor in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/mission-manor-inheritance,0,"Group of 5 coworkers tackled this room on our lunch break with three complete novices in the bunch.  We had a great time working through the puzzles, but I was disappointed at the lack of variety.  The difficulty rating on this should perhaps be a two.... But discounted drinks at the brewery upstairs is a plus!"
"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Mission Manor in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/mission-manor-inheritance,1,I've been to several different escape rooms now and this one was the best (so far). The room was complex with a lot of different things to solve. It wasn't easy but it also wasn't too difficult that we weren't able to solve it. I really appreciated the scoring system and how you have to request for clues. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Mission Manor in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/mission-manor-inheritance,2,I went with a group of 6 with my college girlfriends for our first ever escape room and we were all blown away! We had so much fun in the Inheritance Room and would recommend it to anyone. We definitely will be coming back next time we have a girls weekend in the Twin Cities!
