"Escape room ""RabaBank"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-bank-heist,0,"When my family travels, we always try and find a good escape room.  We found Escape Room 831 and its one of the best, if not the best we've played.  Great fun for the family (2 boys!), and very well done with the design decor and escape scenarios.  Highly recommend this location if you're anywhere near the Bay Area or Monterey."

The owner was so accommodating and fun and the room was brilliant. I cannot wait to go back and try out their other rooms.
