"Escape room ""Private Detective Agency: Knight & Rook Investigations"" by Puzzle Effect Bakersfield in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/bakersfield-escape-room-private-detective-agency,0,"My friends and I tried (and failed) Knight and Rook last weekend, it was difficult but fun. I have done escape rooms in other locations and this was a bit different. We were very close to making it out, on the last step, but ran out of time. Disappointing, but the room was definitely doable if we hadn't missed a couple of easy clues. The owner was very nice and took time after we were done to talk about where we went wrong, what recommendations we had for him, etc. Great customer service. We will definitely be back!"

It's clean and the employees are very welcoming. I would definitely recommend getting a group together and making a night of it. The more people you have the more fun it is.
