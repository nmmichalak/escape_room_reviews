We have done both the mansion murder and the under pressure rooms, and both were great. The rooms are very well done, and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We will be back soon to try the Shanghai Room!"

We really liked that Under Pressure contained multiple rooms and great puzzles that made for an enjoyable experience. It was one of the best escape rooms we've experienced.
