"Escape room ""The Exam"" by Exit Games in Bonner Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/bonner-springs/quests/exit-games-the-exam,1,"We did the ""Exam Room"" for our son's birthday. It was harder than I expected but so much fun! The people there are really nice too. Definitely a challenge but worth the time. We almost made it out in time but went over by 3 minutes! It was still really fun and I would do it again."
