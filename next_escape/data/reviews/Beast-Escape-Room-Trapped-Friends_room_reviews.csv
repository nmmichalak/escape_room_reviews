We're becoming escape room enthusiasts and this room was FUN! We played the Trapped Friends room with a group of 5 and managed to escape with seconds to spare! The owner, Kyle, is a super chill guy with a really positive attitude and the entire experience was a blast! Looking forward to coming back with the team for more adventures."
