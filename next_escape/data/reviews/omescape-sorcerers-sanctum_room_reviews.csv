"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/omescape-sorcerers-sanctum,0,"This is our group's 5th escape room and we can say that Omescape's was easily one of our most entertaining, well designed, and beautifully created rooms we faced.We did the Sorcerer's Sanctum room and although we just missed getting out in time, we still enjoyed the journey and loved the attention to detail in creating an atmosphere that made the experience that much better.The technology used and the fully automated nature of the rooms also are top notch and the amazing staff allow you to have extra time to finish all the puzzles."
"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/omescape-sorcerers-sanctum,1,We did a corporate event here and it was awesome! They were flexible and let us have the place to ourselves on a day they weren't normally open. We got to split up into groups and do any rooms we wanted. Joker's Asylum was extremely difficult and Sorcerer's Sanctum was my favorite. Highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/omescape-sorcerers-sanctum,2,"This was my first escape room, so I did not know what to expect. But, with a few vets in the group, we were still able to make it out in time. We tried the new escape room called Sorcerer's Sanctum. It had this magic theme that I really like. Challenging but not impossible. We made it out in 57 minutes with 2 VERY small hints. Overall, it was a great experience, everyone in our group had fun. We're all young adults in our late 20's, so it might be different case for younger kids."

I love being immersed in a different world, and the Sorcercer's Sanctum escape room made me feel like I was in a magician's manor. I have high standards, and Omnescape met them easily. The theming is top notch.I like that there were multiple rooms in this ""escape room"", too. This made solving the puzzles more satisfying and gave the room a maze-like feel versus just being stuck in one room.Sorcerer's Sanctum also has cool tech.On top of that, the room was very neat and clean.If I want to do another escape room in San Jose, I'm going to Omnescape."

They've all been fun. However, I think Sorcerer's Sanctum is evidence that Omescape is still out to improve upon their already excellent rooms, and I can definitely appreciate that as an enthusiast."
