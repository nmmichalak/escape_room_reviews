"Escape room ""Project MK-ULTRA"" by Escape Game Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/escape-game-knoxville-the-wonderland-escape,0,"We almost made it -- it was just my daughter (11) and I, and we think if we had 1 or 2 more people, we would have made it with time to spare. We did the MK-Ultra room and figured out a bunch of clues together and had a blast. The staff on site was great -- friendly and helpful. Definitely going back soon to try another escape room!"

"Escape room ""Project MK-ULTRA"" by Escape Game Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/escape-game-knoxville-the-wonderland-escape,2,"After living in Knoxville for 9 years and complaining about the lack of things to do that aren't ""go to a bar,"" Escape Game Knoxville was a breath of fresh air. Inventive, innovative, and intellectually challenging riddles and clues that aren't overly frustrating, but provide enough of a challenge that keep you involved and captivated. A job well done to the entire team. I'll be back very soon!"
