"Escape room ""The Starlight Lounge"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Amazing-Escape-Room-The-Starlight-Lounge,0,"Played this one with my family, we got through the first few puzzles fairly quick. This is also a medium-tech room. I personally found this to be the most difficult room they have even though the site lists it as the easiest. There are a lot of red herrings in this room which threw us off for a good 10 minutes. Overall it was fun and we escaped with ~4 minutes left!"

I went with a few friends and when we were finished we were all talking about when we would have time to go back and try the next room. Different and very fun way to spend time with your friends.

We had no problems with booking, even though we had to change the time the last minute. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. The room is well-designed with a bunch of interesting puzzles, even though there were a few times when we were kind of stuck, the game masters were there to help when we needed them. Over all, it was great, fun thing to do, and i would definitely be going back to check out other rooms. "
