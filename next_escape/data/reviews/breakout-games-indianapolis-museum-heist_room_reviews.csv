"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-museum-heist,0,Had a wonderful experience. A groups of friends and I did the Museum Heist. Alicia did a great job with guiding us through the mission. We got out in 54 minutes!!!!! The building was somewhat hard to find in the dark. Having gps is a must if you've never visited. Will plan another outing at this location again.

We went for a friends birthday and had enough people to go with just ourselves into the room. We did the Museum Heist and were able to escape with 14 minutes left. It was a good way to spend a weekend afternoon instead of going to the mall or seeing a movie! I already want to go back to try another room!

This multi-room, multi-player game was a blast! This is a family-friendly game, but it isn't kiddy stuff. We celebrated our son's 21st birthday with the whole family. The group ranged from 16 to 56 years old and everyone got into the mix! Highest recommendation for any group of nerdy birdies looking for a unique game experience!"

This actually worked to our advantage as each of us brought something different to the experience and the younger people in our group brought a fresh perspective we needed. We broke out! You can ask for 3 clues if you get stuck, and our game master was THE BEST. "
