"Escape room ""Condemned"" by Escape Code in Branson",https://worldofescapes.com/branson/quests/escape-code-condemned,0,"We had a fantastic time at Escape Code, we did the ""Condemned"" adventure! Tickets are a tad pricey to do on a regular outing but for a birthday or special occasion once in a while is fine! We went for a 12-year-old b-day celebration. We will be back!"

"Escape room ""Condemned"" by Escape Code in Branson",https://worldofescapes.com/branson/quests/escape-code-condemned,2,We had a great time. We went through the Condemned room. It was based on the Bible story of Paul and Silas' imprisonment. Our 11-year-old had a great time. We are locals and will be back for more. Price wise it was average for Branson.
