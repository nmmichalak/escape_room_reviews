"Escape room ""Prohibition"" by Escape Room Yuma in Yuma",https://worldofescapes.com/yuma/quests/escape-room-yuma-prohibition,0,"This is absolutely the best! Family and I tried the Da Vinci room and the Prohibition room and the sets were so interactive and detailed! You got an awesome soundtrack to your experience that matches the theme of the room. The awesome part is that if you get stuck on a clue you can request hints. We can't wait to test the other rooms they have. Every day of Spring Break my kids were asking to go back, so this place is definitely doing something right! Amazing customer service and attention to details."
