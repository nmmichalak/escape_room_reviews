"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-runaway-train,0,"Had our first experience at Breakout (10/12/18) and what a great time it was. We walked in without reservations and were told our options for upcoming experiences and we booked their newest room Runaway Train. The wait was not long and the customer service while we wait was excellent. The young woman working the check in joked with us and answered all our questions. The game play was phenomenal. Chris, our game master, was outstanding. He provided excellent clues and he even came to our rescue when we had a tech issue with the interactive screen. The theming and detail in the room was unreal. It really looked like a train car. Five stars all the way. Can't wait to do it again."
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-runaway-train,1,"Runaway Train is fun! This is supposed to be one of the harder ones and I see why. This breakout follows the storyline of the brakes not working and you're stuck on the train. Rules are simple and explained well. Now the hard part, thinking! It's definitely fun to go in a group, we had 6! We had to really work together to figure out how to escape. I really enjoyed this since it does make you think and communicate with others. I didn't care too much for the game master's clues. They didn't seem thought out as well as they coulda been. However he was still helpful when we needed him. Now I'm ready to try another scenario...just don't forget it's by appointment only."
