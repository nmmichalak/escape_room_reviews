"Escape room ""Silent Ninja"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-silent-ninja,0,"This was my 4th escape room adventure and Brainy Actz takes the cake.  Had the opportunity to take on all 4 escape rooms available which ranged from easy to mind boggling.  Hands down my favorite was the ""barber shop"" which just happened to be our quickest teamwork escape.  The laser room challenge was fun as well.  Definitely family friendly and the team members very helpful.  Awesome waiting area for non-participants!"
