"Escape room ""The Basement of Horror"" by The Rooms of BCS in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/the-rooms-of-bcs-the-basement-of-horror,0,My whole family had a blast! I can't wait to try the other rooms. We did the basement of horrors and almost made it out. It was sooo much fun for the whole crew and the best part is that my 11 and 12 year-olds could participate and have as much fun as their parents!!

We didn't escape but we got pretty close for a two-person team. We'll get it next time!
