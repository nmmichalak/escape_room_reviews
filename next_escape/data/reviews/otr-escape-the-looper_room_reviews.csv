"Escape room ""The Looper"" by OTR Escape in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/otr-escape-the-looper,2,My sister and I took my granddaughter and daughter who were visiting from the Chicago area to OTR Escape and we tried The Looper. We all had so much fun and escaped with just a couple minutes to spare! The gentleman working there was welcoming and helpful. Must admit we needed clues. Will definitely do this again
"Escape room ""The Looper"" by OTR Escape in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/otr-escape-the-looper,3,"OTR Escape has a couple of positives working for it. 1. Location is in fun, young, and vibrant part of the city, so easy to get to during your night out. 2. It has late hours, so a room can easily fit into your schedule. 3. Three or four of the puzzles in room are thoughtful and creative. Now, for the bad stuff - this company/room gives off the feeling that OTR Escape wanted to cash in on the escape game trend but offer the bare minimum as far as technology and aesthetics. To ask for clues, you are given an inconsistent, poorly functioning walkie-talkie. The room is a converted conference room with white walls and white tile floors with hastily fastened props scattered throughout. This would be a GREAT escape room if it was one that was a temporary installment at a local high school or library, limited in scope, budget, time, etc. But this room should not be these things. An escape game company should have a bit more pride in presentation and tech. Especially at the OTR Escape price point. The employees are also dreadfully unimpressed/uninspired/overall just not happy to be there. There is no ""immersive"" or special feel upon arrival, during the game, or upon solve/breakout. For a first-time escape room player, they would probably still be pleased because some of the puzzles are fun, and I think your first room is cool because its your first exposure to the concept of an escape room. But for anyone who has done a well-executed room, they will be greatly disappointed with this one. Either do an escape room well, OTR Escape, and be fully invested in design, atmosphere, puzzle quality, game master stewardship, or don't bother! 3/10 and goes in the books as my least favorite company and escape room I've ever done.
