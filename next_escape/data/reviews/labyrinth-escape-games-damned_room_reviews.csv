"Escape room ""Damned"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-damned,1,We went with a group of friends and went to “damned” which awesome if you love horror. We were surprised at what “personalized” horror experience really meant! We have already been back and have done the WW2 bunker which was also amazing. We can’t wait until we can go back a 3rd time! The staff has also always been awesome and it’s fun how they really get into character to make things more real.

I cannot express enough how wonderful this escape room is! For starters, all of the staff including the game masters, hostess and co-owner treated us right from the very start. A huge thank you to all of then for making our adventure special!! Then to experience rooms that are well dressed, challenging and incredibly exciting really sealed the deal! We cannot wait to return for more rooms in the future!!!"
