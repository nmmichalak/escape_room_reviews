"Escape room ""The Inside Job"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-the-inside-job,0,This was so much fun! We did the Inside job room with a group of 8 for my birthday and managed to complete it just in time. Most of us had never done an escape room before but George was amazing at explaining what we should do without any spoilers. Will definitely be going back soon to try the other rooms!
