"Escape room ""The Spy Room VR"" by Beat the Lock in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/beat-the-lock-the-spy-room,0,"WE WILL BE BACK TO EVERY NEW ROOM THIS COMPANY MAKES!!!Decided to check it out with a group of friends on Star Wars premier night. It was 100 times better than the other escape the room games we've played. The puzzles were hard, the atmosphere and props were amazing, great support when we needed it. They asked for feedback and were super warm. These guys are just starting up and I can't wait to see what they do next. Most room games feel super cookie cutter and similar, but not here, the puzzles where varied and fun. very creative minds obviously put a lot of work in to setting this room up and letting us solve their riddle of a game.I'd recommend going with a group for maximum fun."

My family of four along with a dad and his daughter worked together to find clues and find the key. Great activity for the family. My 16 year old and 19 year old had a blast!

There were only 4 of us so we didn't make it all the way through but still had a great time. I willdefinitely do this again when they have a new room. The two women running it were also very fun and friendly.

There were only 5 of us, including a teenager and a 6-year-old. And every single person contributed and found some of the clues. I would HIGHLY recommend for anybody that likes games, activities, puzzles, etc. Great work ladies -- can't wait for the next room to be available."

Great time by all, the event had some great surprises, and the event manager Renae was really awesome to work with and very enthusiastic. We had some scheduling issues with our group (people who said they were going weren't able to) right up until an hour before the event, and Beat The Lock was very accommodating and understanding. Everything ended up working out perfect!"

We beat it with just a bit of time to spare, and really felt the pressure to get out in the last few minutes.The ladies who run it are friendly, and helped make the experience even better with their enthusiasm.It was awesome, and I look forward to having a new room to figure out."
