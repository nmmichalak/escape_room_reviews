"Escape room ""Smugglers Tunnels"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-smugglers-tunnels,0,"We have finally tried their newest room, Smugglers Tunnels! Still as fun as ever. This room has less of a storyline, but plenty of challenging puzzles. Instead of trying time to escape, you and your teammates have to get as much treasure as quickly as possible. This adds a different feel to the adventure and my friends and I had a fantastic time with our individual puzzles, as well as the puzzles we worked on together. Missed out on first place, but we smashed second place! Highly recommend Escape Chronicles to anyone looking for a good night of puzzle solving."
"Escape room ""Smugglers Tunnels"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-smugglers-tunnels,1,"I've played around 80 other escape rooms before this review. Both of the games at Escape Chronicles are freaking fantastic. Some of the most unique and engaging puzzles out there. If you're a bunch of first-time players, the Smugglers game is the one I recommend."

I've done a lot of escape rooms, and this was easily one of my favorites, with a solid set of inventive puzzles and a refreshing twist on the usual ""escape the room"" objective. Very impressive to have a room that can equally satisfy both novices and experienced players!"
