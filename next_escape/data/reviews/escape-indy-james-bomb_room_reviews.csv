This was our first trip to Escape Indy, and we tried the James Bomb room. VERY challenging to say the least! We had no expectations because we didn't have a clue as to what to expect.It was very fun and we will definitely go back."
"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-james-bomb,1,"Escape Indy had a good set up and the person hosting us was great, very enthusiastic. We did James Bomb with 4 people - 3 teens, 1 adult. We got to the very end, just needed a little more time. Probably would have escaped with more bodies and minds, but we had a blast, good family bonding time! We would definitely do it again at this location."

Escape Indy was professional, very clean and nice. We did the James Bomb room with only 4 of us and were one code and one minute from making it out. So, so close. We will visit again."
