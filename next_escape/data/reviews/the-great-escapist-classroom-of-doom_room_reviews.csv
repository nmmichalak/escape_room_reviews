Thus far, our favorite room is ""The Classroom"", although I may be biased being a teacher! Just as important, the owner Randi is very friendly and willing to work with her customers..we will continue to come back and bring our friends!"
"Escape room ""The ClassRoom Adventure"" by West Palm Beach Escape Rooms in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/the-great-escapist-classroom-of-doom,1,6 of us did the Classroom of Doom in West Palm Beach. We were all first-time escape room people. We had a phenomenal time. We all developed a rhythm slowly finding our way through the clues. It was amazing. The staff was incredible. Randy made the Escape that much more fun. We intend to return each week and hit another room each time. We're all really looking forward to it. My highest recommendation.

Did the Classroom of Doom. Was an awesome experience. The people running the show are great. Michael did a great job as the controller. We had so much fun we went back again today. Did the Halloween special called Soul Ripper. Another good time.

We booked a whole room and had 3 generations of our family doing the Classroom escape -- ages ranging from from 85 to 15 years old -- and everyone had a great time (the staff were kind enough to bring in a comfortable chair for the older members of our family). Everyone loved it and we plan to go back and try some of the other rooms. Was a great family activity and afterwards we went out to dinner and had a great time.
