"Escape room ""The Cure"" by Room Escape DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/room-escape-dc-the-cure,0,"Had a great time at Escape Room Fairfax. We chose The Cure. We used all three hints. I liked that the hints were just enough to get us thinking in a way that moved us in a different direction, and nothing too obvious. It was a blast, and we canâ€™t wait to go back!"

I had never done one of these escape/mystery rooms before, so I was not sure what to expect, but it ended up being a lot of fun!The clues were definitely challenging to figure out, but we had a really great game master who explained the general idea of how the room would work ahead of time. We ended up making it out with a few minutes to spare! I can't wait to go back and try other rooms."

A little bit pricey but definitely worth it if you're going with friends or family. The two us played with four other strangers but still had a great time since they were fun to work with. We did the cure and it was supposed to be the hardest room they offered and no doubt we struggled a bit, but the host was indeed very helpful and we had a blast figuring things out. We hope to return again excited for another escape!"

We had so much fun working together and not working together to escape. We know what to do and not to do the next escape room, and there will be a next escape room! I was very impressed with the layout and our host. Thank you for the fun memories!"
