"Escape room ""The Fortune Teller"" by Trapped! in Lubbock",https://worldofescapes.com/lubbock/quests/trapped-the-playroom,0,"This was my first time going to Trapped. My three friends and I felt like detectives in a movie. The room's theme, The Fortune Teller, was great and it was fun to work together to figure out all of the clues. We even got to the extra round but ran out of time to complete it. Either way, we are still talking about it to this day because it was so much fun. It was worth every penny. We are definitely going back!"

While we weren't successful, we had a fantastic time. This is a fun experience you don't want to miss. You will have about an hour to work together to obtain the key to escape the room. You'll encounter many challenges that will help you solve the mystery."
