"Escape room ""Agency"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-the-room-texas-the-agency,0,"After a little trouble finding the place, check in was easy. We were taken to ""The Agency"" room with not much guidance except to just figure a way out, no story line or anything. The clues themselves were very random. At the end, we actually found the key to exit but were told we had to finish another obstacle before using the key. They should not have made the key accessible before having to finish another obstacle.Overall, I think they need to find a better flow/riddles with their clues.  The room itself was very cool but otherwise the experience was just OK."
