"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/The-Escape-Room-Prison-Break,0,"After enjoying two of their games SO much, my sister and I decided to go for their most difficult room - Confinement. I was excited for the challenge in puzzles and the darker theme. I do not want to give away any details... but it was much scarier than we were warned.I wonder based on other reviews if I am just scared easily even though I can handle horror movies and such, or if we just got hit with a lot more ""stuff"" than other groups who have reviewed the same room.The puzzles and theming of the game itself was enjoyable. The frightening aspect was in the jump-scare category and there was no warning about this whatsoever.If you get scared easily - do not do Confinement. I really wish I had tried their new room - The Gift - instead! :(  It would have been a better use of my money. I'm just sad about the whole experience. I still highly recommend Entrapment and Prison Break!"

I did Entrapment with friends and then came back and did Prison Break with my husband & kids (ages 23, 19, 8). We had a great time on both occasions! Even though the actual activity is only 60 minutes (or less if you escape, which we did both times), you talk about it for a long time after..."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/The-Escape-Room-Prison-Break,2,"i went in knowing the concept of what an escape room was about and was looking forward to the experience but not looking forward to being in a group with other people since it was just the two of us. we got matched up with our team and it was a bit awkward not knowing the people we were paired up with at all, but about 10 minutes in to starting to rely on them for help to escape, we quickly learned what each member of the group was good at and about 30 minutes in we were really having fun. it was defiantly a team effort that got us to escape the room after 50 minutes and the elation i felt for completing the task with people who were not an hour ago strangers quickly made us friends. it was the other group of 5 that nominated our group as ""the adopted family"". my apprehension for spending that much time in a confined space with strangers was quickly dispelled. i know some of you will question if this is for you for that reason but i believe that anyone willing to pay to be locked up for fun can't be that bad of a person so jump in and try it out. it truly is a unique and amazing experience. the staff are inedible and our game master will was great. he makes sure to explain things well before hand and is a great guide through out the game. i know of a few other escape rooms in the area but this one is run so well and the game i played was so much fun i will not be going anywhere else. give these guys a try, i promise they will not let you down."

Great story lines, very well built rooms, different and unique puzzles and a staff that makes it all worth it! Jareck was our game master and absolutely made our experience one of a kind! Great job! Keep up the great work!"
