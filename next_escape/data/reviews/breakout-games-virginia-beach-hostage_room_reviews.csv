"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-hostage,0,"Had a fantastic experience at the 'Hostage' room! We were paired up with one other couple and we managed to escape in time. The use of technology in the games is very well done and the entire experience was quite challenging. Our ""coach"" did a great job helping us as needed but keeping the game challenging throughout."

We did hostage. Our game host Chris was amazing and gave us hints without giving the answer. Definitely going to have to try the other rooms.

I went with a group of 7 me and my best friend and all our kids. We did the hostage room and it was amazing from start to finish! Our game master goldfish was great and helped us whenever we asked. Never giving away any clue but heâ€™s suttle hints with such a fun demeanor! We escaped with 2 mins to spare! We will definitely be goin back really soon! Great fun for the whole family!!

I was there today with my 14-year-old daughter & her 2 friends. We did ""Hostage"" & it wasn't easy...thankfully the manager ""helped us""! We just missed escaping by about 2 minutes. Extremely enjoyable! Will go back soon & try the ""Museum Heist."" Great staff! Clean & safe. Thank you! : )"

Breakout was a blast! We ended up booking a second game the same night. Would highly recommend this for something fun and different to do. Can't wait to book some of the other rooms!
