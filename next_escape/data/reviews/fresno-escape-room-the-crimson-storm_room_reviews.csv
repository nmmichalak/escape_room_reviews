The employees were incredibly welcoming and friendly from the moment we walked in. They explained the rules well and started us off. The room itself was very thematic and well done. We felt immersed in the scenario right from the beginning. The puzzles were really well thought-out; they weren't overly difficult, but you still got a big sense of satisfaction when you solved them."
