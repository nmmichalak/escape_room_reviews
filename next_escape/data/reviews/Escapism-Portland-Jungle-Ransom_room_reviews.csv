"Escape room ""Jungle Ransom"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Escapism-Portland-Jungle-Ransom,0,"We really enjoyed the Jungle Ransom game! Even though itâ€™s not the biggest and the most advanced room, it utilized the space and the props creatively, leaving enough dead end hints to keep you guessing and searching in the wrong direction. It base mostly conventional locks and keys puzzles, but they are mixed with interesting and unexpected plot twists, which will get your heart rate up. The host Mythius was amazing, animated and immersive, he created the atmosphere from the moment we set foot into the building. We had so much fun playing, and will definitely explore other rooms this company has to offer. "

Our host, Bruce Kincaid, made it so realistic that we forgot we were really kidnapped and could ask for clues! His character is remarkably fun and his energy contagious. We highly recommend getting kidnapped with him, and will definitely be bringing our friends to be held for ransom. Thank you for putting together such a clean, healthy, adventure for the whole family."

It was great to have a fun interactive activity to do that is more than just going to a movie etc. Its a unique and engaging activity to do with friends or with a date. I have always thought that Portland needed more fun things to do indoors when winter rolls around and this is it! Just go, you'll have fun, use your brain, laugh and bond with your friends. What more could you ask for!"

When we got in we felt as if we were trapped in the Jungle Ransom setting. The puzzles were unique and when we tried them we were stuck, but had we kept our train of thought we could've skipped the first two clues. The Jungle Ransom was our first and as it was described to us the more difficult of the Escapisms. I highly recommend it if you can keep your wits about for two people, but come as a group if you want to play the blame afterwards if you couldn't solve it. Definitely looking forward to trying the other rooms!"
