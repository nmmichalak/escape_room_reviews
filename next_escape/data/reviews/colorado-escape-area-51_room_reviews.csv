"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Colorado Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/colorado-escape-area-51,0,We did this escape room with my two sons and my wife it was a super exciting time the room was difficult but not so hard that we were not able to complete the clues. We had a really good time and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly will definitely be back again.

Only one adult in our group had done an escape room before and we escaped! Christina was very helpful from start to finish, she easily accepted our Groupon and got us situated in our room which was Area 51 (the hardest they have). Throughout the process she was attentive with clues, suggestions and hints... while letting us figure it out. She is big on the importance of communication and everyone being on the same page. Everyone has to want a clue before she gives one. We are excited to go back and try to escape some other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Colorado Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/colorado-escape-area-51,2,We completed the Area 51 room this weekend and we had a blast! Went with a group of 6 and only one of us has done an escape room before. We had a lot of fun working as a team to figure out all the clues! We ended up making it out with 8 minutes to spare which was pretty exciting. We had a groupon for it so I'm glad we decided to give this place a try. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other rooms.
