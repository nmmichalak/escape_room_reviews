"Escape room ""Prohibition"" by Escape Room Long Beach in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapelbc-prohibition,0,"Booked Prohibition for my birthday with two of my friends. It was our first time for all of us, so we had no idea what to expect. Little did I know the Prohibition room was the more difficult of the two - so we didn't make it out before the 60 mins. We had a great time though and felt very proud of ourselves for getting as far as we did. Our host was very generous with the hints, since we kept running around the room asking questions. Very fun, will do again but with a bigger group. Thanks!"

It's not boring and was a good first time. I have no complaints. Very well managed and pleasant, fun, and professional staff. The location was clean and a safety briefing conducted."

I have done several escape rooms in the LA area and this by far was the most creative and challenging. You can tell they put alot of energy into creating a fun and exciting atmosphere. Great job guys!
