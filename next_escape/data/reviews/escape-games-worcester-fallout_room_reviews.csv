We got out of Fallout with about 3.5 minutes left on the clock! We were all first timers except for one lady and I couldn't believe how well we came together and expressed various strengths on various tasks mixed with a little luck on one or two of them. I really appreciated the enthusiasm of the Game Masters. Thank you for this experience!"
