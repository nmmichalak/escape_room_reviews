We had a blast. It was super interactive, not too hard, but hard enough to get us thinking, and really got us working together. I loved how you felt transported in the story. The hostesses were exceptionally nice too. Would definitely go again!"

Sad to say we didn't break the curse of the Midnight Carnival with our group but we had a great time making the attempt. The staff was friendly and we will be planning a return trip soon - next time with a game plan.

My team of five coworkers and I did Escape the Midnight Carnival together. The storyline was very well concepted and the puzzles were complex enough to be interesting and challenging, without being totally overwhelming. The variety of puzzle types was such that each of us really had a chance to use our individual strengths, while the overall storyline had us all communicating with each other throughout the gameplay.I'd definitely recommend this for any group, be it work, school or social."
