"Escape room ""Spellbound Supper"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-spellbound-supper,0,"We had such an awesome experience playing ""Spellbound Supper"" last night. Shoutout to our most excellent game master JONATHAN for being just the best. Very pleasant, welcoming, and how he conducted himself as the host/ma√Ætre d' from start to finish really made this a top-notch gaming experience for our group.The game itself was very innovative to me. Not sure how they pull it off, but I definitely felt we got our money's worth. For me, personally, Real Escape games have felt very challenging and near-impossible. SS was actually quite solvable -- thanks to Jonathan's gracious assists. We just didn't make it in time, but again, I felt we got our money's worth and got to experience something innovative and fun we'll be talking about for a long, long time.Minus one star for the condition of the game objects. The projector could have been stronger, brighter, sharper, I suppose. And did not project precisely on the plates. And some of the game objects (like felt and colored masking tape) were coming off whatever the objects they're supposed to be sticking to. Other than that, it was a great evening for all!"

I had no idea what is Real Escape game, I have to escape?for what? from what? just many questions in my head. Anyway,I played Spellbound Supper with my 3 friends.We couldn't complete the game. But important thing is we had a great time to solve the mysteries! What a fun activity I recently discovered.I thought nice mixture of modern and classic.At the beginning we had no clue what we had to do. But A kind butler who serve the supper was assist us really nicely:giving us hints. I impressed that they have a real person(actor) to assist and lead the game,wasn't only automated computer system. I thought it was expensive activity when I purchased it, but after the game I felt great,I'm glad I came!! I can see this game works for building teamwork skills and own brain stretch. I should bring my boss and coworkers to here. I even became a fun of puzzles because of them. I would love to try other games they have!! highly recommended!"

The Spellbound Supper was a blast for this family of four (kids are 12 and 14).  It was quite challenging and we needed a lot of help on some of the challenges, but the staff was great and we got so, so, SO (darned) close to solving the puzzle. Alas. Without giving anything away, this was unlike any escape room any of us have ever done, so it was a fun new challenge for us. Every moment counted. Even though we weren't successful, it was a fab way to spend an afternoon followed by sushi and ice cream treats in the mall across the street for dinner. The kids even thought it was cool to hang out with their parents all day. Win win!!"
