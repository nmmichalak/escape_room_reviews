Very intricate and well thought out. Challenging but definitely manageable. We can't wait to go back and do the third room. Highly recommend!

Some great, some not so good. This one is definitely in the great category. Friendly staff, nice room layout that follows the story line. Some unique puzzles made it a challenging room. We did the Bank Heist and loved it. Can't wait for the other rooms to open. Keep up the good work. See you soon."
"Escape room ""The Bank Heist"" by Escape Room 207 in Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/brunswick/quests/escape-room-207-the-bank-heist,3,Considering I am very new at escape rooms (this was my third ever) I was very pleased with it! The puzzles were original and challenging. Attention to details is critical. My wife and I decided to tackle it as a 2 man team. We were at the final code when time ran out. The Heist is now my favorite escape room. Thanks for a great time!

It was our first ever escape room and we chose the Bank Heist. It was so much fun! The owner, Tom, gave us clues whenever we got caught up on something, but he also gave us time to figure stuff out. He was super helpful and explained the process really well. Can't wait to go back and check out the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Bank Heist"" by Escape Room 207 in Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/brunswick/quests/escape-room-207-the-bank-heist,5,We had a fantastic time at the Bank Heist room! Our guide Tom was great and gave us nudges along the way that truly were needed. I thought the puzzles and challenges were diverse giving everyone who participated a chance to use it their strengths. It was my first time at an escape room but others with us had been to 3 to 5 other escape rooms and all agreed this was their favorite so far. Great job here in Topsham.
