"Escape room ""Ancient Egypt"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Ancient-Egypt,0,This was a super fun activity for our family. We did the Egypt adventure and nearly completed it. Our host gave us an extra few minutes and we got out. It was quite a thrill! The props are somewhat worn and one of them didn't work quite properly so we thought we had not solved it when in fact we went back and it worked later. Lots of fun and we will do it again!
