"Escape room ""The Revolutionary"" by Escape Room Lafayette in Lafayette",https://worldofescapes.com/lafayette/quests/escape-room-lafayette-fughedaboutit,1,Had a great time at this excellent team building activity. The staff was friendly and engaged. My team did the bar room and it was a little difficult but we did it. I could not have solved it by myself for sure. Everything about the experience was good!
