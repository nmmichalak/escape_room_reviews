"Escape room ""Runaway Subway"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-tmnt,0,"Went there last week and it was fantastic. Had an excellent host, Captain K, and the experience was intriguing and fun. Puzzles were interesting, room design/decor was fabulous and the general place seemed very organized and efficiently run. My group was paired with another but everyone still had a role in solving the puzzles and the atmosphere was very friendly. I did the Runway Subway puzzle, and am hoping to go back to try more of them."
"Escape room ""Runaway Subway"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-tmnt,1,Really fun! Went here for a team building event. Did the runaway subway escape room. Only thing a bit disappointing was I feel like our host missed a couple of details when setting the scene for our adventure. Still a really great experience. Loved the atmosphere!

We met with our group and began the fun challenge based on the TMNT story. Although we did not manage to make it out on time, we all had a great evening and made some new friends! Cannot wait to try out another room."
