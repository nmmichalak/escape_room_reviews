I've come twice bringing my leadership team from work and also did my daughter's 13th birthday at the Playground room. The rooms are always surprising and super immersive. Decor and clues are well thought out and not easy. It does take almost the full 60 minutes to achieve. It seems expensive but it's a really fun and rewarding team building activity that I highly recommend.

We did this room with 2 groups we didn't know and almost got out. This room takes a lot of communication and teamwork! The puzzles were fun and we had a great time.
