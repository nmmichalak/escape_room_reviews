"Escape room ""Mystery Of The Red Dragon"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-red-dragon,0,"Red Dragon- We booked this one in the next time slot right after we got out of The Office. This room is intense. It's not like any of the others they have. I had so much fun in this room. Was stuck on one of the first puzzles in the beginning but just remember everything that you need to solve the riddles is in the room with you, no matter how unimportant you may think it is. This room is also a higher tech room which utilizes more than just the typical lock and key. For sure one of my favorite escape rooms! We escaped with 3 minutes left! "

What a blast! We have booked another room, but I was unable to attend do to my dog being ill. Steve, not only was extremely apologetic to what was going on, but he honored my Groupon and set me up for another day! I have to say, that this is the best customer service I've ever received at ANY escape room! The rooms are fun, the challenges are there and the owner is a rockstar! Thank you Steve, for being so helpful. Customer service at its best, we will see you soon!"
