"Escape room ""Escape from the Puzzle Room"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/puzzle-room-sf,0,"I've heard A LOT great things about this place, and so I went in with high expectations. Having high expectations has traditionally been a precursor to disappointment, but not in this case - Real Escape Room was really good and it did not disappointed. In fact, it's safe to say that my mind was blown by the experience.The puzzles were very well designed, and there were twists and turns that kept us asking for more. I wouldn't want to give out any spoilers, so I'll just end this review with a utmost recommendation of this place. I can't wait to attend future events/puzzles! :)"
"Escape room ""Escape from the Puzzle Room"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/puzzle-room-sf,1,"I came here with my friend on a whim when we saw an advertisement while having high tea downstairs in the Free People building. There were set times when they meet, so we went to the next time available. You are suppose to book it ahead of time, but we didn't know about it. However, we got lucky and they squeezed us in for the Puzzle Room. The max was 12 people, but we had 13. We paid $30 after the game ended because their credit card machine didn't work, or else we would have paid before the game. Cash is preferred.The girls that work there are really nice and friendly. The random team that I joined was smart and aggressive (in a good way because we escaped!). I didn't know what to expect or know how intense it would be, but now I do. I will be more prepared next time. I'm glad that I experienced this on my birthday! :D I will try the real escape game in San Jose next time!"

Really creative puzzles and a great staff supporting you. I'm definitely going to try some of their other rooms."

Though we were close in solving the game, it was definitely different playing with strangers and not knowing what everyone was doing.When in doubt, just start opening everything and anything you can get your hands on! I did the Time Travel Lab with a group of friends and loved the experience. Being able to solve some of the puzzles = amazing!If you get stuck, you can get help to move along with the game.Very fun experience even if you don't win. :)"
