"Escape room ""Big Top Circus"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-big-top-circus,0,"My boyfriend and I are escape room enthusiasts and North Valley Escape Room continues to surpass our expectations with every new room they open! We have done all of their rooms, most recently doing their Big Top Circus. Their circus room is amazing! Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this room. It is now in my top five favorite rooms (we've done 121 total so far to give you a comparison). It is very aesthetically-pleasing and the puzzles are very clever, well-themed and challenging. All of their other rooms are very well done, too. One thing that sets North Valley apart from some other local escape room places is their employees. They are personable, fun, helpful and have a genuine passion for escape rooms and talking to others that do as well. Their clue system is very fluent and doesn't lead you in the wrong direction and they are quick to deliver them when needed. We love North Valley and can't wait for their next room to open because they never disappoint. There is a lot of heart that goes into their rooms and it definitely shows. Keep up the great work and keep wowing us with whatever comes next."

It was really thought out and well done and lots of riddles, puzzles and locks, but it was linear so we couldn't work on different puzzles/riddles individually. We had to ask for quite a few clues since some of them were a bit difficult. There were multiple rooms and it was fun seeing each themed room. I can't wait to try The Great Outdoors next time!"

We've done and made it out of three of the rooms (Big Top Circus, The Great Outdoors, and Alcatraz). We even did two in one day because we couldn't get enough! I've been through a few other rooms, and NVER really knows how to serve up an immersive, detailed experience for all involved. We'll definitely be returning to try all of the other rooms!"
