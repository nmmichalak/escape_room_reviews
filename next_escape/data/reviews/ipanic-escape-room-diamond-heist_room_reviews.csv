"Escape room ""Diamond Heist"" by iPanic Escape Room in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/ipanic-escape-room-diamond-heist,1,My first time there with my son! And Wow what a blast we had in the Diamond Heist Room. David was absolutely fantastic and made my first experience very enjoyable. David was without a doubt very informative and helpful guiding us! He gave us a sneak peek of Shipwrecked and that is definitely one we will do on our next visit. Take a day and go check them out it will definitely be worth it! Great family bonding and team building!
