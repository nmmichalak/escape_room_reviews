"Escape room ""La Cosa Nostra"" by RI Riddle Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/ri-riddle-room-la-cosa-nostra,0,"We did La Cosa Nostra. Very clever story and clues. We really enjoyed the mechanics of the room as well--a lot of heart and brains went into their design. Byron was very friendly and accommodating. You can tell he loves what he does. If I'm ever back in Rhode Island, I'll be back."
"Escape room ""La Cosa Nostra"" by RI Riddle Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/ri-riddle-room-la-cosa-nostra,1,"We solved Cosa Nostra with my mother-in-law and brother-in-law's family. Mike gave us 5 extra minutes because we were so close and the last group of the day. There were 3 extra ""rooms"" (if you count the car) to break into. The scene is super authentic. My father-in-law knew the owner of the Old Canteen. Very fun!"

I was highly impressed with not only the complexity of the puzzles you had to solve but also the room setup and decorations! Had a blast and we will be back!
