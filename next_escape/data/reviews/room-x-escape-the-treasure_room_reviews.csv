"Escape room ""The Treasure"" by Room X Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/room-x-escape-the-treasure,0,"Such an amazing experience! We did ""The Treasure"" room in a group of 8 adults. It was a challenging room so the extra people may have helped, but at times it felt like one too many people. Such a well thought out room and unbelievable tricks/effects! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Do not recommend for beginners unless in a bigger group. Will definitely be back to try the other rooms!!"

"Escape room ""The Treasure"" by Room X Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/room-x-escape-the-treasure,2,Our team very much enjoyed the Treasure room. The puzzles were challenging and very engaging. We had 8 people and every person was busy the entire time working on a puzzle but they were also able to keep track of the other things that were being solved at the same time. I would recommend this room and am looking forward to completing the other room that this company offers.
