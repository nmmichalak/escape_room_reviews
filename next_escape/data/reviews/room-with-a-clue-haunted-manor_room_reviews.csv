"Escape room ""Haunted Manor"" by Room With a Clue in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/room-with-a-clue-haunted-manor,0,"This is one of the most fun group activities I've done in a very long time. Even though we didn't beat the Haunted Mansion, we spent a very engaging, sometimes frantic hour as we nearly escaped. A special shout-out goes to our game master, Precious, who did a great job facilitating!"
"Escape room ""Haunted Manor"" by Room With a Clue in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/room-with-a-clue-haunted-manor,1,Challenging but not too hard to work out. The Haunted Manor made us work as a team and used all of our individual strengths. Thanks for a great time!

It was a wonderfully creative escape room which we thoroughly enjoyed. The game master was great about offering us hints when he saw us flailing, and even offered to trade time for clues when it was clear we were going to run out of time. We ultimately ""escaped"" but officially, we didn't. :-) The puzzles were clever and thematic. Double thumbs up for this escape room experience!"
"Escape room ""Haunted Manor"" by Room With a Clue in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/room-with-a-clue-haunted-manor,3,"Not my favorite room. The puzzles were ok, mostly traditional and a bit cliche if you have done many rooms. The room is not heavily themed, meaning I did not feel like I was in a haunted mansion - more like someones house with a few Halloween decorations."
