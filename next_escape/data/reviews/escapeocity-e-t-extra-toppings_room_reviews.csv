"Escape room ""E.T. Extra Toppings"" by Escapeocity in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapeocity-e-t-extra-toppings,1,Had a great time here in the “Extra Toppings” room for my mom’s birthday! The room was extremely well done and very fun. So creative and smart. We didn’t make it out in time but that didn’t subtract from the fun at all. It was the first time doing an escape room for all of us and I have to say they set the bar pretty high. We will be back for the other room!
