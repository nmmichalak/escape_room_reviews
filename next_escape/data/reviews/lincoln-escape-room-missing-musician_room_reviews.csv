We did the Missing Musician room, and it was so fun. We really had to think and put our heads together. We laughed a lot! The staff was great. We will definitely be going back to try other rooms! Thanks so much for a great experience!!"

My parents and 16-year-old brother come visit from Illinois about once a year and I'm always looking for something fun to do. This place was fantastic. The staff were super friendly, the room was a (fun!) challenge, and we had a great time working together to figure out how to get out. We talked about the Escape Room for the rest of their visit! Get a group together, put your thinking caps on, and be ready to do a goofy dance to get a helpful hint."

We'd never done anything like it, but we love using our brains, so this seemed like an excellent thing to try. The staff we encountered were very friendly, and the challenge was just about a perfect level. Difficult enough to make it feel ""real,"" but not so difficult that it became frustrating. This was one of the best dates we have ever been on together, and we can't wait to come back!"
