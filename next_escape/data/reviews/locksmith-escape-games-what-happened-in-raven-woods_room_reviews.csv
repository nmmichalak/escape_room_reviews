"Escape room ""What Happened in Raven Woods?"" by Locksmith Escape Games in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/locksmith-escape-games-what-happened-in-raven-woods,1,"We booked a room for just the two of us and we were really happy to find that it was going to be a private experience. They don't just fill up the room with anyone who wants to join. The puzzles were tough enough to challenge us and the hints were straightforward and helpful. We were in the Ravenswood room: creepy, mildly scary, fun!"
