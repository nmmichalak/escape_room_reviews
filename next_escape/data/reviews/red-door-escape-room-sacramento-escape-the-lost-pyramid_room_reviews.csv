"Escape room ""Escape The Lost Pyramid VR"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-escape-the-lost-pyramid,0,"My friends and I played the new VR Escape The Lost Pyramid room that opened today. Originally we were supposed to do the first VR room, but Jay was very accommodating and let us try the new VR room instead. We had an amazing experience! Will definitely come back to try out the regular escape rooms!"
"Escape room ""Escape The Lost Pyramid VR"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-escape-the-lost-pyramid,1,"Love this place. The Escape rooms are one of the best designed. It's definitely challenging and fun.The staff is always so friendly and fun. They certainly make the experience better.I like their membership program, they have cool offers and gifts.My most recent visit was for their new VR game, which we played Escape the Pyramid. Although VR was not completely new for me, playing with a group was a different and unique experience. It had a similar style of challenge of their standard rooms, but it felt a bit easier. I'd still recommend it anyone.It's a bit disappointing that they're limited to only 2 games in VR. I wish they had more options. Since it's digital, it could be potentially unlimited. The employee made it sound like the games/rooms are expected to change every ~2 years. I wish they had more rooms  for more players (more than the 4 it's currently limited to). Until then, I suppose I have to go somewhere else for a new experience?! I"
