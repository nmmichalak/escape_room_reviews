"Escape room ""The Toymaker"" by Escape Games Riverside in Redlands",https://worldofescapes.com/redlands/quests/escape-games-riverside-the-toymaker,0,I have done both of the rooms by Escape Games Riverside. They are well thought out and extremely fun. I've done over 20 escape rooms and these are by far some of the better ones I've done. The pirate room is extremely challenging but the puzzles are fair and well thought out. The toy maker room is so much fun and is more hands on and tactile.

The owners and game master were extremely nice as well!"

We went to do the pirate room and ended coming back for the toy room. Both were great. Staff was fantastic and might be our favorite escape room we have done. Great experience overall.

Both rooms were amazing. Our group had a lot of fun, and our gamemaster was awesome. Creative puzzles! Can't wait until they open their next room!"

I took my son for his 16th birthday today. There were six of us. We did the toy room. I highly recommend this place. The owner was very nice. I will definitely go back.
