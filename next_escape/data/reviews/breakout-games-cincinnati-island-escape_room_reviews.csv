Clean and challenging. We did the Island Escape. The puzzles were challenging and fun. The staff was kind and cheerful, very professional, and the colours they gave were profoundly helpful without giving things away. We will definitely be back!"

It was pretty well done but the room was very small for anyone with claustrophobic issues! The Island Escape was amazingly well done inside a room!

We had 8 people in our party ranging from 7 years old to 40+. We had an amazing time. It was a fast-paced puzzle adventure. I'm sure everyone will enjoy their experience there!
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-island-escape,4,We did the island escape room with our two children aged 5 and 8. I was very pleased and shocked about how much the kids actually could do. This room was perfect for young families. We loved it! Would highly recommend this place. We have done escape rooms at other places that were no where near as fun as this one. Definitely worth the price. We escaped with 32 seconds left to spare.
