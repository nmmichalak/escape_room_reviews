I thought it was going to be easier and I was pleasantly surprised that it was just difficult enough. We really enjoyed it! Super friendly and funny staff as well! I recommend it for date night!

We missed our reservation but the staff was so wonderful to put us into another room later even though they were almost booked up. My husband was sceptical about coming but he absolutely loved the experience when we were done. Thank you Escape Countdown for helping Valentine's Day not turn into a total disaster for us and helping us to make a memory that we will cherish!
