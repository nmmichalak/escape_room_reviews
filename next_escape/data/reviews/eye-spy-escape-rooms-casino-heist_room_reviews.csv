Perfect for so many things: date night, group dates, team building, or just a plain fun night out! We did the Casino Heist and now we can't wait to go back and do WW3! Emory the owner is so awesome and personable. After the game she stayed and chatted with our group. Had such a great time and can't wait to go back!"

I had a total of 12 friends and we booked two rooms. I was in the Casino room and we escaped but the other group didn't. We are planning on going back to switch up rooms. If you're looking for a fun place to go, check out eye spy. Ms. Emery is the best hands down. We will be back soon."
