"Escape room ""Secrets in the Attic VR"" by Beat the Lock in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/beat-the-lock-secrets-in-the-attic,0,"This is our second trip to Beat the Lock. The first time we did the Spy Room, this time we did the Secrets in the Attic. Both are equally challenging and fun. The puzzles are amazing. We really got immersed in the story. The staff are friendly. I can't wait until they add new rooms. I highly recommend this escape room for beginners and pros alike."
"Escape room ""Secrets in the Attic VR"" by Beat the Lock in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/beat-the-lock-secrets-in-the-attic,1,This was my first escape room experience. We were celebrating my 40th and it was me and 9 of my friends. It was a great challenge and the host was amazing. Especially dealing with our crazy group. Can't wait to do the spy room next time and hope they set up other rooms.

We beat the lock, but just barely. It was challenging and fun, and kept all 10 of us working the entire time. I liked that everyone in our group, from the 13 yr old to Grandpa were involved and able to solve clues! We definitely want to come back!"
