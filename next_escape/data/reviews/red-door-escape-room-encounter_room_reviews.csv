Our group of four had a wonderful time with the room. Our game master, Taylor, was amazing and made the experience even more fun. The room was immersive and the puzzles were really challenging. The venue was clean and easy to find. Definitely recommend it you're in the DFW area and looking for a fun and challenging game."

"Escape room ""Encounter"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-encounter,4,"I had never done an escape room before, and neither had my friend I did Encounter with. But we had a lot of fun! The set was really well made, the puzzles were quite interesting and tricky, and we found a couple different ways to solve them than were required. There was one puzzle we never would have figured out without help, but our game master was happy to explain it to us just enough to get us in the right direction. Even though the last room was a little anti-climactic, it was still a fun experience. Now I'm curious to see what the other rooms are like."
