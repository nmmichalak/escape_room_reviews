We had such a good time in the Willy Wonka room we did Point Break the same night. The owners were awesome! Can’t wait for the next room they will have! You have to check this place out.

None of us had ever been to an escape room before, and didn't know what to expect. the owner was so friendly, and explained how everything worked. We did the point break room and it was so hard! We didn't escape, but I'm pleased with how close we got! Would absolutely love to come back! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ from me!"

It was a sea of key and combo-locks, and a jigsaw puzzle at one point. You'd unlock boxes to find more locked boxes inside them, so the room didn't flow, but stopped abruptly several times when the excitement of opening something revealed only another thing you didn't know how to open. The second room is a big letdown when you look in and it's just a wall of key and combo locks."

My hubby and I, along with another couple did that “bank vault” room and we had a ton of fun! Was challenging, in a good way. This is perfect for a rainy day, or just something different and fun to do! The husband and wife owners were awesome and explained everything to us...we can’t wait to go back to try the other rooms! Perfect fun, right in Clayton!"
