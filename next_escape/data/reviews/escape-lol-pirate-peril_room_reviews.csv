"Escape room ""Pirate Peril"" by Escape LOL in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-lol-pirate-peril,0,"One of my birthday presents was an escape room. We chose the Pirate Peril. We solved the mystery, but didn't make it under the required hour timeframe. Missed it by eight minutes. The four of us did extremely well considering the room can hold up to ten people. So, we'll take it. Lol!Recommend Escape LOL to everyone! Great clues, excellent guides, and tons of fun! "

I've been thru several of these and each time just barely missed the timeline. This time whether due to the team-mates or luck, (I like to think it was the players) we made it out. So Argh and shiver me timbers - I'd recommend this one to anyone who enjoys solving problems."

Only one of the children had done an escape room before, so this was a new experience for most of us. We had a blast! We were able to escape but with not much time to spare. The kids loved it and were begging to do the Prison Break room afterward! We will for sure be back! Highly recommend this adventure to all!!!"
