"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/ultimate-escape-game-amnesia,0,"I went with 5 people, spent $150 and we didn't finish. This is a big disappointment. When we asked for help, the lady didn't know which stage we finished. No one guided us along to help us finish. This is why it has so many bad reviews that no one finished. In all the escape rooms I have been to, the guide made sure we didn't spend a lot of time on one thing to make sure we finished the mission. We expected it to be scary. It was far from scary. The decoration was awful. There was too many locks. It wasn't creative at all. You are basically opening locks the whole time. Will never come back again. Not worth the money, not a great experience. Go to another escape room. This is an honest review. "

We took part of our ninth grade class (47 students) to Escape today and they had an awesome time. It was a great experience in critical thinking, analytical skills, and team work. They had an awesome time and didn't want to leave. Thanks to the wonderful group planning team and staff. They understood the special needs that come with coordinating a field trip for minors and even accommodated our bus. A+ from Newton High School!"

If you get stuck, you're missing something. Very well designed puzzle, and I'm hoping to try the others, even if we didn't beat the room."

This will test your mind to the fullest. The Amnesia Room is the most difficult of them all.....didn't know this before we selected it, but man did we have a blast. Each clue opens another level of excitement while the clock ticks away."
