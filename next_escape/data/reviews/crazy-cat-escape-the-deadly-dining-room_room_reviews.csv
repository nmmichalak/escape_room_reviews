"Escape room ""The Deadly Dining Room"" by Crazy Cat Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/crazy-cat-escape-the-deadly-dining-room,0,"Did Dead in the Dining Room. Great old-fashion escape room with manual number, letter, and key locks. Overall, fun experience!Pros: Easy to book, friendly responsive staff, Groupon deal, parking available, and we escaped!Cons: Everyone was solving their own puzzles, and no one was working together. I've since done 2 other escape rooms in Houston (Escape Hunt and Escape Now), and the others have more multimedia and interactive clues and locks."

(ha!) Depending on who you were with, this could go very well for you or not, and we got lucky in that once we started communicating properly everything came together. There were some fun puzzles and everything was intriguing; we'd recommend that you examine the room VERY carefully and pay attention to everything you are told before you go in.We had fun, even though some times were frustrating while some of the team was stuck waiting before we could be much of a help to the others (again - communication issue and not a fault of the room)."
"Escape room ""The Deadly Dining Room"" by Crazy Cat Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/crazy-cat-escape-the-deadly-dining-room,2,"We did the Deadly Dining Room. It had some pretty unique aspects. There was also a wide range of puzzles. However, it was fairly reliant on locks. The background story was pretty interesting and continued to play a part during the room escape. We also had a few people who were a bit late and they were pretty nice and allowed us to start a few minutes late. Really nice and helpful staff that gave us a great intro and run through at the end even though we were the last group of the day. Overall, we really enjoyed it! Sadly, we missed the record by 30s!"

He had so much humor and made everyone feel comfortable! The deadly dining room was so challenging, yet so much fun. I will definitely be returning to complete some other rooms. I will recommend to anyone that visits to observe others' strengths and communicate!"
