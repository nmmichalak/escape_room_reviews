"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-escape-game-las-vegas-playground,3,"Being the escape room enthusiast I am, I nearly blacked from anticipation when I received emails of a new escape room opening in the Caesars Palace Forum Shops.The Escape Game is located on the terrace level of the shops positioned right in the middle of the floor. We inside and the lobby has a nice layout. A menu to show you the four rooms they currently offer, merchandise hanging up, iPads to sign waivers, and descriptions of each of the four rooms.My friends and I signed up for the room ""playground"" with a difficult of 6/10 it sounded like the funnest theme to us. Upon booking my group of 3 we were told playground is extremely difficult without at least 4 people .......... but this didn't deter us we don't back down from challenges.The mission to the playground room is to complete the assignment assigned with each subject of a report card before your hour is up............. All I can say is WOW !!!!!From math to science to humanities to English and so forth each subject had a unique puzzle. They were so interactive and so unique. Having done +50 escape rooms I can say I've never done one that was so hands on.The Escape Game set a high bar on our first go around and I can't wait to do the other 3 rooms."
