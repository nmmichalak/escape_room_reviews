Bo was our Game Master, and was fantastic. We attempted Bank Heist, but unfortunately were unsuccessful. We were so close, but Bo was happy to show us the few remaining steps. The room setup was great and clues were amazing as well. We will definitely be back soon! Thanks Bo for making our experience so great! We will definitely want you to be our next Game Master as well! Ask for Bo"

I have been here twice and both times I had a blast! The staff members are friendly and super nice. The escape rooms have a great storylines and well thought out clues. It is nice to have a place like this closer to home without having to go to Buckhead or Alpharetta to have a fun outing. I've done Beach Escape & Bank Heist. Beach Escape was awesome!
