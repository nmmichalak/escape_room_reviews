"Escape room ""The Seance"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-seance,0,"I came here with my family and we did the new room ""The Seance"". It was beyond amazing, production value was insane! There are some moments in the game that we really freaked out because it felt like the room is haunted.This room is on the scarier side. But we loved it! They have 4 other rooms that are not scary at all so we are also planning on trying them out in the next future."
