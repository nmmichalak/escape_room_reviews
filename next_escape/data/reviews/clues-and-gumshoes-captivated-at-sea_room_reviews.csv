"Escape room ""Captivated at Sea"" by Clues and Gumshoes in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clues-and-gumshoes-captivated-at-sea,0,What a fun way to spend some time with family or friends!  We had so much fun figuring out how to escape from Captivated At Sea. Much better than a couple of hours at a movie or other type of entertainment. We actually needed to work together to solve the clues we were finding and each solved clue led to another clue. The clues were all unique and intriguing. The solutions were a lot of fun.The creators of Clues and Gumshoes are clearly very creative. They put together an interesting room with an interesting story to go with it. Lots of fun things to interact with in the room.This experience has definately got us hooked on Escape Rooms. We want to go back and try the other three rooms at Clues and Gumshoes.

Our group did the ""At Sea"" room and it was one of the most challenging escape rooms I have ever done. They have some very unique puzzles that we had never seen at other places, which made the room fun to solve.I highly recommend this place!"
