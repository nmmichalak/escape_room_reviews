"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,0,"My least favorite panic room iâ€™ve ever done. We got stuck on an early puzzle, and did not understand it even after the lady in the room was trying to show us. There was no way to move forward, and so we were stuck for 40 minutes (as all puzzles are sequential). We got told the answer only 3 minutes before the end, and so had no way to see the rest of the room. Also, the puzzles were not really related to the theme."
"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,1,We just did the Primal Quest room and loved it. We had very little experience with doing escape rooms but were able to figure out most of the clues with only a little help. We really enjoyed our experience and will be coming back. One major advantage is that you can book a room for only two people and not have to be combined with another group. We did fine with just the two of us.
"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,2,I was part of a group of 6 where none of us have done a puzzle room like these before. We did the perfect crime room and had an absolute blast! Made it out with seconds to spare.

Loved it so much! We were 3 people and worked well; one experienced his first time with us and was an awesome puzzler himself! Wish we had more time! I'd have loved for us to try the other 2 rooms. We succeeded in 36 minutes and 53 seconds. I highly recommend it and love that any booking was for your own group, no extras. I highly 5 stars recommend it."
