"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Hawaii Escape Challenge in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/hawaii-escape-challenge-virus-room,0,I got this for my birthday from my daughters and it was our first escape room ever. Staff is very friendly and the clues were very helpful. The room itself was a real challenge and we had to come a second time (with a huge discount!!)to solve the riddle finally. Too much for a first escape room for my team while it was very exciting!! I highly recommend Hawaii exchange challenge!! We are hooked! We just did our second one and we canâ€™t wait to do the third one next month!!!!!!

The challenge had an appropriate level of difficulty and the puzzles were challenging and fun. Our group's age ranged from 10-33. My ten-year-old daughter was actually a big help and she really enjoyed coming with our group that evening.Our gamemaster was awesome from entrance to exit. He was very interactive, patient and a lot of fun ""behind the scenes.""We definitely look forward to another family night out. We would definitely try the Virus again until we successfully escape the room. Our next choice would be The Cellar after hearing more information about this particular room/challenge."
