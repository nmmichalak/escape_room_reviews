The room was put together very well. The puzzles were very engaging and challenging, but not frustratingly so. We will definitely be coming back to try the other rooms."

I loved the dark. The clues were well laid out and it inspired team work. I cant wait to try out vegas room and the xmas room too when they get that running. Thank you for an enjoyable evening.
