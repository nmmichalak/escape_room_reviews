"Escape room ""Back to the 90's"" by Great Room Escape in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/the-chamber-escape-room-back-to-the-90s,2,"We went to the Chamber Escape room for my husband's birthday. Casie was very helpful to get all signed in and our game master was fabulous. We did the 90's experience. It was three rooms and much more difficult than I first thought it would be, but we conquered it before the 60-minute time limit was up! Would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun group date or evening out! Loved it!"
