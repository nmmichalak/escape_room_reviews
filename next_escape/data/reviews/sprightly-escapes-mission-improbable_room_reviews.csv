"Escape room ""Mission Improbable"" by Sprightly Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/sprightly-escapes-mission-improbable,0,"We had a blast! The owner was fantastic. The Mission: Improbable game was a perfect difficulty level - with another 5 minutes, we would have made it! The clues via walkie-talkie were spot on - they didn't give too much or too little. Super fun activity to do with a group to ""switch things up"" a bit! I've done a few escape rooms, and this one is my favorite so far :)"
"Escape room ""Mission Improbable"" by Sprightly Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/sprightly-escapes-mission-improbable,1,I was looking for something to do in the Denver area with some family. We've played numerous rooms across the country and were looking for a great one in the area. Sprightly Escapes didn't fail us! We played Mission Improbable and gave our best attempt at stopping an evil time traveler from rewriting history. Our entire group was impressed with the immersive feel of this particular escape room - we often feel like that's missing in other rooms. Clues and puzzles were also aligned to the story which we really appreciated. This kept us immersed in the experience and it kept us on our toes throughout the entire hour! Definitely recommend checking this escape room out if you're looking for something fun to do in the Denver area.
"Escape room ""Mission Improbable"" by Sprightly Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/sprightly-escapes-mission-improbable,2,My 9 year old son and I tried out the Mission Improbable room and had a blast. We did not escape though made a valiant effort with just 2 people. There were lots of challenging puzzles and the environment inside the room was like no other escape room I have been in up to this time. The owners have some real creativity and have put together a great experience. I look forward to returning to try the other room.

We tried the new dinosaur themed room and it was a blast. We'll be back soon to try their original escape room.

Two of us had done escape rooms before and three had not. The hostess was thoughtful and thorough during the introduction, and made sure we were all comfortable before locking us in the room. We did Mission Improbable and--while we got off to a slow start--the puzzles, clues, and challenges ramped up into a wonderful and exhilarating experience! No spoilers here, but we escaped with some time to spare. We can't wait to come back again for the other room."
