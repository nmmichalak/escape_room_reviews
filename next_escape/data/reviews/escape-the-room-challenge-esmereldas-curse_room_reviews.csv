Have done other escape games and what I liked about this location was that the waiting area was decorated with puzzles and codes to get you in the spirit of the game. Other locations had boring office like waiting areas."

These people are about designing fun - you won't regret spending an hour (or less) locked in a room with your friends or complete strangers!

"Escape room ""Esmerelda's Curse"" by Escape the Room Challenge in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/escape-the-room-challenge-esmereldas-curse,5,This place was a blast and there's really nothing quite like it! The attention to detail is very nice. The staff is very friendly and loved to make new customers feel welcomed! We were able to escape the mob room with 2:00 minutes to spare so we got our money's worth but money is the one down side. At $28.00 a head it's not the cheapest thing to do in the world but it's definitely something I'd do at least once!

The Curse is well designed and has challenging puzzles that range from fairly easy to very complex (not difficult but complex). The Escape the Room building itself is very nice and the staff friendly. They want you to have a good time. My group did, and we look forward to going back."
