Challenging and fun with a big group! Definetly had a ""Saw"" vibe to it and a eerie atmosphere. The staff was awesome, very helpful and laid back, gave us some extra time cause one from our group was running behind and didnt start right at our assigned time slot. I will for sure be going back to try the other 3 rooms!"
