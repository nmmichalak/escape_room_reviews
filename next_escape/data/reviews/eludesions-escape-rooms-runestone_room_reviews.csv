"Escape room ""Runestone"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-runestone,0,"My husband and I have done over 20 different escape rooms within Phoenix and Pittsburgh.  Runestone is definitely one of our favorites!  First of all we were blown away by the lobby.  Not at all what I was expecting to find next to the discout movie theater!  It is gorgeous and looks really upscale.  We enjoyed the room itself, Runestone.  It had a nice mixture of different types of puzzles and our clue master was great.  Can't wait to go back and try one of the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Runestone"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-runestone,1,Amazing experience! We went tonight as a family and went through Runestone and I was fantastic. We've been to loads of other escape rooms and this was by FAR the best! It can be difficult but it is a challenging and rewarding experience! I can't wait to go to their other rooms!
