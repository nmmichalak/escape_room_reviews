All I can say is WOW!!!I've done over 40 Escape Rooms and this is #1. From the game, to the effects, to the design, it was just incredible. I felt like I was literally in a fantasy world. I definitely recommend this place to everyone!"
"Escape room ""Sky Odyssey"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-sky-odyssey,1,We did the Sky Odyssey escape room yesterday. It's the most beautiful and elaborate set I've ever done. There are a lot of puzzles and distractions in this room. A big group is needed.

Really good value!"
