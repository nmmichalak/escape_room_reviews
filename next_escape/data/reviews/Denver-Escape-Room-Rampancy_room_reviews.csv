"Escape room ""Rampancy"" by Denver Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/Denver-Escape-Room-Rampancy,0,"I went with a group of three friends and joined another couple for the hardest room, ""Rampancy"". Our minds were put to the test as we conquered patterns and solved logic puzzles. The clues were helpful but not obvious, the puzzles all made sense, and we almost finished which we were extremely proud of. 10 more minutes would have resulted in an ever so satisfying victory. I will definitely be bringing friends again to tackle another task. Highly recommended for anyone with a sense of adventure."

I was a little skeptical at first since I had never been to one of these before, but we will definitely be back. We did white lie and it was challenging but also really fun. The guys that did the room with us were great considering we did not meet them until yesterday. I recommend it to any couple or friends who are looking for something unique and fun"
