Went with a group of friends which was great! I love that you can book an entire room. We did the Pocono room. I thought this was great for a bunch of first timers! It was challenging without being too hard that we didn't ""get it""We managed to escape in 33 minutes and we are all pretty proud of that!! As we were leaving one of the employees mentioned a horror room for Halloween! That will be awesome!!!!"

The staff was courteous and helpful, and the ""Heist"" was well thought out, interesting, and appropriately challenging. Highly recommended."
