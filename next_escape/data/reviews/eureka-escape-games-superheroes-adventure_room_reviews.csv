The guys running it were amazingly nice and helpful, and while we didn't breakout, it was definitely doable. The puzzles were difficult, but rational and well conceived. Thanks for a lovely afternoon!"

We will be back to do another one for sure! It was way more fun than i thought it would be as i am not a puzzle fan but our daughter has been begging to do one.

It was a little disappointing to hear when we got there that the room we signed up for only had like a 15% success rate. It was definitely very challenging. The electronic safe failed, costing us several minutes while we waited for staff to come with a key. The puzzles were interesting but we still don't know where on earth all the clues are in that room! We did not break out."
