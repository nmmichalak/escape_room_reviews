LOVED SUZY. The soundtrack was amazing for sure and added to all of the ambiance. The CABIN was creepy but well done and I applaud this place. I will be back for sure. Got my cousins into it...

We chose Suzy's cell, & ended up having a lot of fun! It took all 4 of us & the help of a few clues to get us out, but it was a great experience. Staff did a great job as well!"
