"Escape room ""Escape from the Grande Strand Hotel"" by Riddles Escape Room in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/riddles-escape-room-escape-from-the-grande-strand-hotel,0,This was one of the best escape rooms at the beach for my family I really enjoyed the room we did which was The Grand Strand Hotel Room and it was very family friendly. This is a locally owned and operated business which I also like to support as well. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well which is a plus!!! Thanks again for an amazing experience Riddles until our next family vacation next year!!!

The staff was super friendly and the room was really challenging yet fun. We definitely needed a lot of help :) I have done 3 other rooms at different places and this one was one of my favorites! "
