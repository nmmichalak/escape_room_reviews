"Escape room ""The Cell Block"" by Cluemaster Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/cluemaster-escape-rooms-the-cell-block,0,This is an amazing place! Great for everyone. We did the cell block. It was really fun. We had four people and barely made it out in time. A lot of good puzzles. Some really simple and some difficult. The customer service here is top notch. I love hay they say we want y'all to have fun. It's not like other escape rooms where they take pride in you not finishing. They want you to succeed.

Well done! Very difficult, but the challenge was worth it! Make sure that you ask for clues. I love it when rooms are not just lock and key. This room included more ""reactive"" than items when certain puzzles were solved. Right up my alley!"
