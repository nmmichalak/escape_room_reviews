"Escape room ""Inside Area 51"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-inside-area-51,0,"I did the Area 51 room with a small group of friends from work. We are a moderately experienced escape room group, and we found this room to be quite difficult. We needed several hints to make progress but we were finally able to get out of the room. If you love puzzles and a tough challenge and have a few buddies with similar mindsets, this is a great place for you!"

They were thoughtful and I think on par with the ones I've tried before. If you are going to do one, try Area 51! That one is amazing and takes extreme teamwork to get through it. Try it! It's a lot of work for your brain but it's also a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it."

I did both Salem and Area 51 in one weekend. Although my team didn't make the 60 minute mark for Area 51, they were kind enough to give us more time to finish up and escape. Very excited for their upcoming rooms."
