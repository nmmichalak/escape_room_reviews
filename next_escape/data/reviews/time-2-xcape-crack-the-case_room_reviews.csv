"Escape room ""Crack the Case"" by Time 2 Xcape in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/time-2-xcape-crack-the-case,0,"We were a group of 5 first time participants and found Crack the Case using an online search. Since we were not sure what to expect we resolved to be part of the 10% success rate. The room was challenging without being overwhelming. We were given clues only when we reasoned through them and arrived at wrong conclusions. There were a few times we tested theories incorrectly and were allowed to proceed through them until we reached a dead end. Hints only came to correct our line of thinking--never a direct answer which we all enjoyed. Overall we had a great time for this birthday outing! I highly recommend this room to those seeking a challenge! Oh, and yes, we were able to Crack the Case!!"

Although this is a relatively new place, we were very impressed by how well thought out the “Crack the Case” room was. It was the perfect balance of difficulty without being impossible. We will definitely be back to try the other two rooms!"
