"Escape room ""Guardians of Time"" by Escape! Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-entertainment-guardians-of-time,0,"I bought 5 tickets for myself, my brother, boyfriend and our two friends. I have done escape rooms before but for the other 4 in my party this was their first time. Our ages range from 25 to 38. We did the guardians of time room at the valley location which is their most difficult room. I was impressed with the difficulty and elaborate detail of this room. We used the extended time offered for a few extra dollars and made it out in an hour and 28 minutes. (It was quite complicated) but we all worked together and had a blast. Everyone forgot about their phones for 88 minutes and it was just 5 friends trying to find their way through time. To anyone who is thinking about doing this, it IS worth the money. I promise."

We participated in the Guardians of Time in the Spokane Valley. It was well thought out and fun. Everyone had fun solving the various puzzles to progress. We play these at home and enjoyed the challenge and the more real-life experience Escape offers. The staff was pleasant and helpful, when needed. Would definitely doing it again, trying another theme."
