"Escape room ""Conquered Embassy"" by The Escape Branson in Branson",https://worldofescapes.com/branson/quests/the-escape-branson-conquered-embassy,0,"I have been to multiple escape rooms and this is worst by far. The equipment in room didn’t work properly and staff was aware, they didn’t even offer an apology. There are numerous choices in Branson pick any other one than this."
"Escape room ""Conquered Embassy"" by The Escape Branson in Branson",https://worldofescapes.com/branson/quests/the-escape-branson-conquered-embassy,1,A group of friends and I did the Embassy room today. We eventually got out with 12 minutes left. It was super fun and very well thought out. Also the lady working there was AMAZING. She fit us in even though we didn't have a reservation and she was super funny and sweet. 10/10 would recommend.

Todd was friendly and helpful and got us set up in The Conquered Embassy right away. We finished in time with a couple of clues. Hoping we can play another while we’re here!
