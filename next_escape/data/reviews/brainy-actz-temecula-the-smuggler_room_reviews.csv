"Escape room ""The Smuggler"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-temecula-the-smuggler,0,"We had such a great time doing their Smuggler room that we returned the following weekend to experience both their Legacy and Great Pirate Escape rooms.All three rooms were fun-filled, offered intriguing back stories and a great balance of riddles, puzzles, locks, and hidden secret mechanisms.  The attention to detail Brainy Actz puts into their rooms is way above the rest and makes for a fully-immersive and unforgettable experience.  Our game master was Austin, who did an amazing job hosting and guiding us through our games!Being escape roomaholics, we plan to visit all of their other locations and highly recommend their rooms to others in search of an amazing time!"
"Escape room ""The Smuggler"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-temecula-the-smuggler,1,"We did the smuggler's room at this location earlier this week and had a great time! The room had a nice aesthetic, has a good layout and fits the needs of the backstory. Austin was very attentive, kind, and gave us clues only when needed. He was great and so we made sure to tip him accordingly! We completed the room with 18 minutes to spare, but it was a challenging room that requires critical thinking and teamwork. We will definitely be booking another room at this location soon."

The design was done very tastefully and the puzzles were challenging without being impossible.  As an added bonus, Austin, our game master, was a great host.  Our whole family had a a really fun time.  We can't wait to go back for another room."
