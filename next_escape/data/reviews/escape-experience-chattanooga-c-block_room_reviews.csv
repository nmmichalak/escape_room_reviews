"Escape room ""C-Block"" by Escape Experience Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/escape-experience-chattanooga-c-block,0,"I assumed when I first went this would be at least a LITTLE lame. I couldn't have been more wrong. Loved it, went back and loved it again. All 3 experiences are challenging and very fun, and when the next one opens, I'll be in for that one too. Outstanding experience."

We ran into a snag because one of the locks were placed incorrectly, but it was still a blast and I highly recommend it. I dropped a star because because of the incorrectly placed lock. There will absolutely be a rematch if I'm ever in Chattanooga again!"
