It was the first escape room we've ever been to. We started out in a room blindfolded and handcuffed to a bench. It was thrilling, but a great experience! We got to meet new people and we all used our minds to escape with 9 minutes remaining. Will was very helpful when we called with questions and Scout was our game master, we loved her and canâ€™t wait to go back and see her!"
