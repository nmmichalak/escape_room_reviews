"Escape room ""Jailhouse"" by North Texas Escape Rooms in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/north-texas-escape-rooms-jailhouse,0,"We had my friend's birthday party here, and it was fabulous! The room was so fun, with additional rooms within rooms, fun puzzles, and exciting clues. The rooms are challenging, but not overly  frustrating. Our game master, Keith, was the cherry-on-top of our experience. He was helpful, and fun. Highly recommend this place for any event or celebration!"
