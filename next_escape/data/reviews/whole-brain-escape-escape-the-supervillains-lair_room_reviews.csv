"Escape room ""Escape the Supervillain’s Lair"" by Whole Brain Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/whole-brain-escape-escape-the-supervillains-lair,0,"We visited Whole Brain and did both Escape the Supervillain’s Lair and Bustin' Out of the Eighties. The owners were both there and were fun to chat with.Bustin' Out of the EightiesWe've done a few really *bad* Eighties-inspired rooms, so it was a real treat to see a room get it so very right. The props were a great touch, so many times I found myself just wanting to sit down and look at the memorabilia instead of completing the puzzles! There's also a lot to do in this room - we split into two groups and both stayed plenty busy for the entire experience. Really recommend!Escape the Supervillain’s LairOddly, I've seen very few Supervillain rooms. Plenty of mad scientist, etc, but never just a comic-book supervillain. The room was a little more linear than their Eighties experience, but we were all still engaged with a variety of different types of puzzles that called on each of our strengths. One puzzle went between 4 of us, each figuring out a small bit and another group member getting the next part. Really great design."

The rooms were all clean and well put together, the props were fantastic, and the puzzles were just the right mix of challenging and solvable. The owners were super friendly fun. I’d highly recommend this place, and can’t wait to try the 80’s room and see what they have in the works!"

We did the Escape The Supervillan's Lair room and it was challenging and fun. Many cool puzzles and some fun riddles. One made us jump a bit. Super family friendly and fun. We are very exited to do the Bustin' Out Of The Eighties room here as well. The people here are very nice, friendly, and helpful. Room was set up very neat and well. There were no problems or difficulties in the room. Was a very fun hour."
