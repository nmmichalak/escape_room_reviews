"Escape room ""Movie Theatre Escape"" by Locked: Escape Game in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/locked-escape-game-movie-theatre-escape,0,This was an awesome experience! We did the Movie Theater room and Calleb was our game master. He started the experience off with personality and helped us feel comfortable enough to ask questions. The room was challenging but fun and we were laughing and having a blast the whole time. Loved it!

Lucas was great accommodating us with a time that worked around our drive through town. Calleb made the experience wonderful. He's a great gamemaster and fun to talk with. We loved the movie theatre escape. The puzzles are challenging, fun and manageable. The room is immersive with fun surprises! We will definitely be back our next trip to Tennessee!!"
