We have done 5 escape rooms in total, but the one at Escaped in Time was certainly one of our favorites. Well thought out and wonderfully decorated and executed. We will be back for sure."
"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-the-attic,1,"We had a blast! It was easy to make reservations and everyone was very friendly. We tried out the Attic and it was so much fun. For most of us, it was our first escape room and we didn't make it out but were close! We did use clues and they were helpful. We can't wait to go back and try the other rooms."

"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-the-attic,3,We chose the attic...awesome family adventure...great time and great memories created! My oldest son came from Dallas/Ft Worth for Christmas. He has participated in several 'escape room' events back in the DFW area. He said this was one of the best experiences he's had! Our family group ranged in age from 72 to 24- and we all had a blast!! Can't wait to try another room!!
"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-the-attic,4,"We came as a group of seven and they were able to accommodate us last minute on a Sunday afternoon - we played in 'The Attic' and had a fantastic time! It was difficult enough to seriously challenge all of our puzzle solving skills, but easy enough to where none of us became frustrated. They have clues that help you progress in the story, and clues that are meant to distract you - there are a couple really cool moments that no one expected and I can only imagine how funny it would be to rewatch all of our reactions! It's family owned and the people were so kind and helped us feel comfortable. Thank you Escaped in Time for an awesome family bonding experience!"
