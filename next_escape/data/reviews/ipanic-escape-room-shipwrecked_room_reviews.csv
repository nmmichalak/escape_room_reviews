"Escape room ""Shipwrecked"" by iPanic Escape Room in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/ipanic-escape-room-shipwrecked,0,I’ve tried all 4 rooms at iPanic on separate occasions and they’re all extremely top notch! The game masters are always very helpful and make the experience even more fun. Their 1-hour and 20-minute rooms are all unique experiences and I would definitely recommend for all sorts of groups wanting to have fun and put themselves to the test.

My husband and I came here for a date night and our very first escape room experience. We chose the shipwrecked room. What I failed to realize when making our appointment online was that we chose the hardest room according to the staff. This room was HARD! We literally would have never figured it out if they didn't give us clues along the way! We did not escape in time but at the end they showed us what the next steps would have been and there's no way we would've finished. We had so much fun! We decided to try an easier one called abracadabra afterwards and that one we got with 30 seconds to spare. They did give us a couple of clues but it was a lot of fun, too. Just my husband and I went. If you do go for a date night, I would recommend one of the 20 minute rooms or both. If you aren't sure, call them or just ask when you get there. After we finished they'd said they recommend the shipwrecked room for several people. Overall we had a great time! They even give you a coupon for your next room after you finish."
