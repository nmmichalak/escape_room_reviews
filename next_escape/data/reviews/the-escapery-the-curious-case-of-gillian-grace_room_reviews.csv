"Escape room ""The Curious Case of Gillian Grace"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-the-curious-case-of-gillian-grace,0,"We did the Curious Case of Gillian Grace room...and we got out! It is touted as the most difficult at The Escapery, and it did not disappoint. The clues and games were so elaborate and fun, my wife and I had a blast. By far the best Escape Room Iâ€™ve attempted. So creative, and our host was awesome as well! Thanks for a great time!"
"Escape room ""The Curious Case of Gillian Grace"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-the-curious-case-of-gillian-grace,1,"We went as a big group and did a private room of The Silo experience. The puzzles were great, and it was just challenging enough without being frustrating. We had so much fun we came back a few hours later and did the Curious Case of Gillian Grace. That one was tough, but our group made it out in the Knick of time. Very professional staff and well-lit and clean areas and rooms. Would highly recommend. Olivia and Katie Mae were our game masters and they were great."
"Escape room ""The Curious Case of Gillian Grace"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-the-curious-case-of-gillian-grace,2,"We went to the escapery this weekend and it was amazing. Our escape room was called ""The Curious Case of Gillian Grace"" and the plot to this room was rich, full of details and very immersive. The interactive technology in this room blew my mind. This was our 4th escape room and easily the best and most challenging. The props were intense, from the mirror that allows your to communicate with the past to the time machine you could tell that an incredible amount of work and attention to detail went into this room. Our gamemaster Zak was kind, helpful and really took the time to ensure our experience was far beyond what we have experienced anywhere else. Well worth the price and I can guarantee if your gamemaster is Zak you and your group will have a good time!"
