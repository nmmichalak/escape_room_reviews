"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/breakout-games-oklahoma-city-operation-casino,0,"We just completed the Casino Royal room in 57:39! The room had a good story to follow. The room was clean. The puzzles were hard but fair. Lisa was a great host, very attentive & helpful. We had to request a couple of ""hints."" She did a great job helping without giving anything away. We plan on returning for another room. Lisa suggested the Runaway train next for a more difficult room."

We tried very hard not to use some hints but we eventually needed one. The only problem was that some doors wouldnâ€™t open even when we typed in the right answer. Thankfully our spectator would pause the time for us."

Very well crafted game design; the puzzles are difficult enough to be fairly challenging, but not so tough that you can't figure them out in time, and the moment of clarity when you figure them out is very rewarding as they're complicated enough to make you feel pretty clever when you solve a clue. Highly recommended!"
