"Escape room ""Room 2217"" by Cubic Escape Room in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/cubic-escape-room-room-2217,0,"Played with 5 other friends in Room 2217. I would say this was by far the best escape room I have experienced. Most escape rooms focused on the puzzle and required a good understanding of American culture, they were kind of too hard for people from non-English speaking countries. While Room 2217 gave us a totally different experience via a story, it was so real. The ending was really out of expectation. Highly recommended."
