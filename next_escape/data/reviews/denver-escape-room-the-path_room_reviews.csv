Such an awesome brain teaser and while we didn't finish in time we came oooo-so-close and I can't wait to come back and try another room.If you're looking for a fun time for 6 or 10 people and interested in trying some different than the normal bar/restaurant then certainly give Denver Escape Room a try, it's sooo much fun!"

We completed The Path and they loved it! Can't say too much about the room obviously, but it was themed and a great experience. Definitely recommend."
