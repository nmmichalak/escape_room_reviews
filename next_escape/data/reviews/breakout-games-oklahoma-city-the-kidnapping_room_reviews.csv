"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/breakout-games-oklahoma-city-the-kidnapping,2,I went here for the first time with the GF and we had a blast. We did the kidnapped room and it was well worth it. The puzzles were challenging yet fun for both of us and our game master was very polite and helpful. We will definitely be back with our friends to play again in the future.

What an experience! Our group of 7 ladies completed Kidnapping with only about 2 minutes left to spare. Twists and turns every direction, we really had to think outside the box and work together for the various combinations in the room and eventually out of the door. Thank you Marlon for being a wonderful game master and putting up with our shenanigans :) we will DEFINITELY be back again!!"
