"Escape room ""Houston, We've Had a Problem"" by Escape Hunt in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-hunt-houston-weve-had-a-problem,0,"I can't say enough about this experience. The professionalism and attention to detail made the room real. My team worked together, fully engrossed in the scenario and almost forgot we weren't at NASA circa 1970! If you are looking for a fun experience with a realistic but extremely fun scenario, this is your place! One of the best escape rooms in Houston!"

Our family chose to do ""Houston, we had a problem"" as part of our Christmas gift to each other. We had a wonderful evening! Even the youngest player (13 years old) was able to make great contributions to the solution. We were winners because we had a great time together. The set is incredible, very realistic. Well worth the money."

Really excellent in every way. The room is technologically advanced - very much like an actual flight simulator. It's very challenging but also very rewarding for those groups who work together. Communication is key! This is highly recommended.

"Escape room ""Houston, We've Had a Problem"" by Escape Hunt in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-hunt-houston-weve-had-a-problem,5,We've done quite a few escape rooms and this was the best so far. The Apollo experience was well crafted and provided a very immersive environment. The staff was professional and courteous and even the lobby was well appointed with puzzles to entertain you while you waited. Looking forward to our next escape.
