Our group of seven came to tackle the Missing Musician room, and we all had a blast. There was enough for all of us to do, even the children ages 7 and 10. The whole setup was very creative, and we managed to get out with just a few minutes left. The woman working the front desk was super friendly, which is always a plus! We definitely plan to return to take on some of the other rooms."
