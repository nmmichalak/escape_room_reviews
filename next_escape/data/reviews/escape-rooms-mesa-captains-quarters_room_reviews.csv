The staff were very friendly and professional. Thank you, Espace room Mesa."

The staff are friendly, the puzzles were interesting and the ambiance very fun! We were able to have the Captian's Quarters room all to ourselves and we finished a minute ahead of the hour. After we were finished, the staff let us use props from the room to take pictures, and gave us souvenir rubber bracelets. Plus, when the staff heard it was my sister's birthday, he gave her a Happy Birthday rubber bracelet!"
