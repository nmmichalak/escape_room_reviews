"Escape room ""The Tomb"" by Trapped in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Trapped-Double-Agent,2,"I can't recommend Trapped enough! The owners were very welcoming, friendly, and enthusiastic. The puzzles and clues were clever and challenging. As another reviewer mentioned, the rush of figuring out a particular problem is addictive! I can't wait to go again and tackle their other room and the rooms to come. My whole group had a wonderful time and achieved inflated senses of our own intelligence--it was money very well spent!"
