My family and I got together for a birthday celebration via the Palace Games escape room. Multiple generations working together to solve puzzles? Needless to say it was a blast. It was incredibly engaging, creative and interactive."

It was a seemingly endless adventure of discovery, technology, puzzles and teamwork. I really can't say enough about how fun and well done all of these room are.  I understand how technically complicated the Edison Room is and how much of a challenge it must have been to create. My hat is off to everyone that was involved in its creation. Wow. Just wow!"

It's the first room I've done, so can't compare to the others, but I had a great time. We had the full 8, and didn't feel too crowded even though it was above the ""optimal"" number. Had high expectations, and I was not disappointed. I look forward to doing more rooms with these guys in the future."
"Escape room ""The Edison Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/palace-games-the-edison-escape-room,4,"I've done all three rooms by Palace Games and they're all so much fun. Definitely worth the price. I'd recommend doing them in the order they were developed (Houdini, Roosevelt, Edison) as they just keep getting more and more impressive. We had a group of 9 for the Houdini and Roosevelt rooms and 8 for Edison and there was plenty to do for everyone. I've done escape rooms at 4 other venues but these three rooms are definitely the best 3 I've ever done!"
