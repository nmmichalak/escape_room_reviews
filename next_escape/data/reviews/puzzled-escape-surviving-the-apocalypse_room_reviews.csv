"Escape room ""Surviving the Apocalypse"" by Puzzled Escape in Brighton",https://worldofescapes.com/brighton-mi/quests/puzzled-escape-surviving-the-apocalypse,0,"I was a group of four couples who did the Apocalypse escape room this week.  This was a birthday present for one of the members of our group.  Most of the group were first timers in an escape room.  All of us had a great time!  The Apocalypse was challenging and engaging.  The staff is excellent, friendly, and helpful.  I definitely recommend Puzzled Escapes and the Apocalypse room."

The bunker was so freaking cool! Both games have great flow and puzzles match the theme so you really feel immersed in your surroundings. Owners are so sweet and accommodating. Love Puzzled Escape!
