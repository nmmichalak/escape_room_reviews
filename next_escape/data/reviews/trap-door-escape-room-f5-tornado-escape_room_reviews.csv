"Escape room ""F5 Tornado Escape"" by Trap Door Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/trap-door-escape-room-f5-tornado-escape,2,"Just did the F5 Tornado escape room today and enjoyed it.  Trap Door really went all out in preparing the set for the obstacle course part of the game.  The final room was more of a typical escape room with puzzles to solve. My only complaint was that I think there could've been a better variety of puzzles as they were all lock-based. Other that that, we enjoyed this escape room as it was a lot different in that it involved more physical activity.  We took a significant amount time on the last puzzle primarily due to a ultra-sensitive lock.  We had the right code in our minds early on and tried it around two times but wasted time trying all sorts of other combinations when the right code didn't work right away. In the end, we tried the right code again and it finally worked.  We escaped with 3 minutes to spare."
