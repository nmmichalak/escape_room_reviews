"Escape room ""Al Capone’s Speakeasy 1929"" by Time to Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/time-to-escape-al-capones-speakeasy,1,An all around a great time. We did Al Capone's Speakeasy. The addition of an outside character (the bartender) we needed to haggle and negotiate with really differentiated this escape room from others we've done. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a personal and challenging game.
"Escape room ""Al Capone’s Speakeasy 1929"" by Time to Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/time-to-escape-al-capones-speakeasy,2,Had a great time at the Al Capone Speakeasy today! Definitely a worthwhile and fun outing for a group. The room was really decorated well and you felt like you were back in a 1929 speakeasy.

We went through the Al Capone room, which was unlike any other escape room I've been to. All of us had an awesome time, and we'll definitely be back this summer to try the other two rooms."

I have done over 30 at this point and the in-character person ""James"" was incredible. Had so much fun."

It's a little awkward at first but once you understand the system of finding/hearing clues and figuring out what to do next, it's a blast! The actor/""bartender"" was fantastic and really made the experience. Will definitely be back for other themes!"
