"Escape room ""Shadows of the Skunk Ape"" by Rabbit Hole Escape Games in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/rabbit-hole-escape-games-shadows-of-the-skunk-ape,0,"Our group did the Shadows of the Skunk Ape room this weekend, and loved it. This was the first time for my nephews to do an escape room, and they thought it was so cool. My ""hardest to please"" teenage nephew said he was satisfied. He was so excited to tell his friends about it, and wants to do it again. My other two nephews are eager to do it again, as well. The room is very challenging and impressive. Although, we didn't finish the room in time, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We highly recommend Rabbit Hole Escape Games."

Being a first-timer, I was nervous and didn't know what to expect. The staff explained all the rules and answered all my questions. You learn to work as a team. Everyone had a great time."

From the mix of puzzles (there was something for everything) to the theming to the mechanics of the way the room worked, we were so impressed and had such a fabulous time! Not to mention our game master Kidany who had us laughing from the moment we first stepped in the door. He only added to the fun and made the whole night that much better :) It was such an amazing experience form start to finish that we couldn't recommend enough! Can't wait to go back and try their newest room!"

But the kids had done one before. We all had a really good time. The puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. Fun storyline. We really like that it covered multiple rooms. Staff was helpful and friendly. They just opened a second challenge - a sequel to the first storyline. We will definitely be going back for that one!"
