"Escape room ""Medieval"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-sd-medieval,1,This was awesome! The Medieval room was an exciting adventure. My husband and I worked as a team trying to beat the clock. We can't wait to go back for another fun date night and couples building. As well as to go back with the kids. Highly recommend.

Employees were super friendly, and the intro video gives backstory to your experience. I was absolutely wow'd entering the room. Great design and attention to detail. Unfortunately, there were a couple of disappointing things, including one of the puzzle pieces being broken. If you were inexperienced with escape rooms, this might be a blocker. Yet they opened just recently and I'm sure will work out all of the kinks."
"Escape room ""Medieval"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-sd-medieval,3,"Solid escape room experience. We did the ""Medieval Room"" with a group of 8 on a Sunday. Staff was friendly and accommodating of our group and schedule. We made a reservation in advance, and the entire event ran smoothly. We had the room for an hour, and it took us about 30-minutes to complete all of the puzzles without hints. It felt shorter than other escape rooms I've done, but the size of our group could have easily impacted that.SLOPS: Medieval Room puzzles felt a bit easy. That being said, this WAS labeled as ""medium difficulty."""
