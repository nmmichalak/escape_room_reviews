"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-the-castle,0,Just finished doing The Castle room and had a blast! We did this room with 6 people and had a lot of fun with all the different sorts of puzzles and hidden compartments. The Castle is not a place where you get locked in but rather a puzzle room to get to the holy grail! The staff and lobby were nice. Highly recommend this place. Can't wait to try the other room!
"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-the-castle,1,Quest Factor is so much fun! It is a little pricey ($30/person) BUT it is worth it! (In fact I think most escape/puzzle rooms are about this price.) Aside from the price the experience is great!! It feels like you are in a movie!The rooms vary in difficulty and theme. It's helpful to have people with a variety of skill sets so solve the riddles. Overall I would definitely recommend. We just did the Castle experience and it was fun!
"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-the-castle,2,Played the Castle escape room while visiting Seattle.This was a very heavily themed room and a lot of fun.  The designers were around when I played and they were very attentive to helping make the room enjoyable.The room had a couple pretty tough puzzles making the room more difficult than some but mainly understandable and solvable.The room was mainly hand crafted with some pretty unique and amazing props.Definitely worth the visit - make sure to bring a phone with a flashlight feature as it is a little dark inside and they encourage you to use your own light if needed.Probably better for adults - and maybe teens
"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-the-castle,3,We did 2 rooms for my bday since my group was 14 ppl. The castle and leonardo rooms. We had a great time! Such a fun and different bday experience. We split up into 2 groups. Our group in castle finished with just seconds to spare and the other group just barely got beat by the room. Thank you for the fun time. We will be back!!

It was our first time. We didn't finish but the room operator showed us the last couple steps we needed to accomplish. He was awesome from beginning to end and we plan to do all of them soon =)) I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!!"
