"Escape room ""Grand Theft Jersey City"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-grand-theft,0,"My husband and I woke up with hand, foot, and mouth disease this morning, which we caught from our two year old daughter.  My husband is miserable and I am in a lot of pain.  Neither of us foresaw this and we were both looking forward to attending prior to becoming ill.  I am aware that there is a $30 rescheduling fee (which seems high, as each of our tickets cost $30 as it is) but I thought that illness might be an exception, especially as this rash is highly contagious and I did not develop the blisters until this morning (the day of the booking).  Unfortunately, upon calling, the employee informed me that his manager could not authorize the waiving of our rebooking fee.I honestly find this to be ridiculous!  When exactly does the manager find a situation necessary for the fee to be waived!?  Only after someone dies?  Am I really expected to come in and participate, possibly infecting all those I come into contact with and while in pain?My husband and I are first time parents and live in Jersey City with no nearby family.  We literally had this date night planned for weeks and it was devastating enough just to have to reschedule it, let alone find I needed to cough up ANOTHER $30 just to schedule it for another day.  I am not made of money as it is and have to budget out the things we do paycheck to paycheck.  Not only do I not have an extra $30 on hand, I also feel strongly that it was not fair or just to expect me to pay.  I honestly feel like the manager I spoke to had no empathy or compassion for my situation and when I expressed my frustration with him and ultimately told him I planned to communicate via the website and other online forums about my feelings he smugly told me to use my freedom of speech and hung up the phone.I am now out $60, with no experience, and feel like Iâ€™ve been treated like a dispensable piece of garbage.  I will NEVER give my business to puzzle out again and will specifically seek out alternative puzzle room companies to give my business to in future.  I also plan to provide an in depth review of the company and how I was treated to every website I can find.The employees should really be trained to have more compassionate toward their customers and attempt to treat people with more genuine respect."
"Escape room ""Grand Theft Jersey City"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-grand-theft,1,"Came here with a group of 12 people to try out the ""Grand Theft Jersey City"" puzzle as a team building experience.This place is located in a busy spot in Downton Jersey City. It's hard to find parking, but there's a parking garage about a block and a half up the street to your left. The spot is pretty small, but it does the job. The hosts were nice and the accommodated us waiting for one of our guests who was running late, which we greatly appreciated.We had a great time trying to solve as many puzzles as we could to rack up money. Definitely a hard task with so many people talking at the same time, but this is where the teamwork comes in. If you get stuck, the hosts help out with little clues on a screen.My only complaint is that the bathrooms were GROSS. So gross, that I couldn't even use them."
"Escape room ""Grand Theft Jersey City"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-grand-theft,2,"Went here with a large group for a birthday party. We were very excited to do the competition mode. We did the girls against the guys. The room was really small and the time dragged. Once we had left I was charged an additional $700 on my card since that was the method of payment that I did. Allegedly, in the room that the guys were in they had broken some boxes. According to the manager because I was the only one that paid with a credit card I was the ONLY link they had back to this party. If I wanted my money back I had to bring the guys back in so that they can be charged. I explained that I was only a guest of this group and did not know the entire party. I even asked to see the surveillance of the room when the ""alleged"" incident happened and they refused. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GOING HERE! My $25 escape room experience turned into a $725 experience."
"Escape room ""Grand Theft Jersey City"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-grand-theft,3,"Really excellent set up and game - truly involves team work. I went twice in the last five months - one as a team building exercise for my staff members and the second time with family - both times the game was different, the experience was unique, and everyone had a great time. The staff is really friendly and helpful and the building its housed in is historic and hella cool. Take the fam, take friends, or take your co-workers to a really great time. Also comparatively far less expensive and really accessible to parking and the train."

If you are looking for a creative way to enhance the relationships between employees, we highly recommend this out of the box service!"""
