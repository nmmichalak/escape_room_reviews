We booked the room last minute and they were very accommodating. Chris, the employee who accompanied us in the room, was so lovely and fun to be with! He really helped make my mom's first escape room an enjoyable experience. I can't wait to come back with a larger party and try another room! Thank you for a great afternoon!"

We did the Carnival room and loved it. It was so much fun! David, our guide, was excellent and we really enjoyed ourselves and actually made it out by working together as a team. The whole staff loved it and it was great talking about who did what later over dinner. I highly recommend them!"
