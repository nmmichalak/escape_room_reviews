He booked for 6 people but there was a confusion in our booking instead of calling right when she didn't show because we meant for the next day they waiting 3 hours after the room start time to call and say hey where are you?  I apologized and said no it was meant for tomorrow which the room was still completely unbooked for. He said"" it's okay... Well actually it's not. You didn't show so you can buy tickets again but we won't work with you"" mind you I bought for 6 people. They wouldn't even offer a rebooking fee. Extremely rude people and has forever lost the business of my friends family and I.  "
