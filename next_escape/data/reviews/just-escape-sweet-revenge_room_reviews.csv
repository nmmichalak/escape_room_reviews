"Escape room ""Sweet Revenge"" by Just Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/just-escape-sweet-revenge,0,"Went this past Saturday and had a blast! We did the Sweet Revenge room and beat it. It ended up being just my cousin and I bc of the weather and I think it was better that way. If there were more people in the room I feel like we would have been too crammed. We haven't stopped talking about it, we'll definitely be back!"

"Escape room ""Sweet Revenge"" by Just Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/just-escape-sweet-revenge,3,"We had a small group of three for the ""Sweet Revenge"" room. At first, I thought the room looked too simple (not a lot of places to hide things). However, it was great! Plenty to figure out. Our game master, Bonnie, was good at helping us along, just enough so we could keep on track. We goofed and laughed but managed to escape and enjoy some candy afterwards!"

We had a blast! I love how all the clues came together. We escaped!! I would definitely recommend going to Just Escape for a great time out with friends. We had a laugh reliving the experience while enjoying our candy."
