We're looking forward to the chance to escape our next room!

This was our second time doing an Escape Room and we were impressed. The Gauntlet had lots of great puzzles and although we ALMOST made it out on time, it took lots of family teamwork! We will definitely return!"
"Escape room ""The Gauntlet"" by Esc4pe Room in Burlington",https://worldofescapes.com/burlington/quests/esc4pe-room-the-gauntlet,2,Our group did The Gauntlet. I would say medium difficulty? It was so much fun though! A lot more detailed and tech-y than our rooms at home. Wish I was in town long enough to do The Minimalist!
