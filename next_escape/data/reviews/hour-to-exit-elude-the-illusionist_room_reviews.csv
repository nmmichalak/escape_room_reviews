"Escape room ""Elude The Illusionist"" by Hour To Exit in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hour-to-exit-elude-the-illusionist,0,We did the Elude the Illusionist room yesterday and had a fantastic time. The room was challenging and had really interesting puzzles and great attention to detail. Highly recommend and can't wait to try their other rooms!

Fantastic design, unique clues, fun theme and owners were great. We are escape room fans and have done well over 50 rooms in a variety of cities. (Trying to compile a list to have an exact count). This room is in the top 10%!! We had a lot of fun and canâ€™t wait to return soon!"
"Escape room ""Elude The Illusionist"" by Hour To Exit in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hour-to-exit-elude-the-illusionist,2,"WAY different from Pandora's Box, non-linear, and follows a story line somewhat. Everyone will be working on something, a lot of detail is involved, and a bunch of fun interactions. Nice mixture of tech and traditional locks were in the room and the room looked well-thought out. We were immersed in the setting of the room and it made the experience that much more fun. Escaped with 10 min to spare as well!"
