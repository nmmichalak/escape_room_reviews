We did ""lock and roll"" and it was a bit cheesy, but no pressure. Will be fun to come back to try the other rooms."
"Escape room ""Lock and Roll"" by Cooperstown Escape Rooms in Cooperstown",https://worldofescapes.com/cooperstown/quests/cooperstown-escape-rooms-lock-and-roll,1,This was a super cool experience! The puzzles were challenging and entertaining to solve in the lock'n'roll escape and we had a great time. I wouldn't recommend more than 6 people in the room at a time though; even that started to feel crowded.
"Escape room ""Lock and Roll"" by Cooperstown Escape Rooms in Cooperstown",https://worldofescapes.com/cooperstown/quests/cooperstown-escape-rooms-lock-and-roll,2,Took my daughter's friends here for her 10th birthday. The Lock and Roll room was so much fun! The kids had a blast. We didn't realize how interactive the game can be depending on your progress. The staff was extremely accommodating and prompt with email inquiries. Offered a space to celebrate with cake and presents if we needed. We would like to come back and try the other rooms at some point. Thanks for a great morning.
