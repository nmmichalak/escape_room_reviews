We had my daughters 13th birthday in the Blackbeard's escape room. The girls had a fantastic time trying to escape. The staff was wonderful! That had a nice waiting room with games and such to keep the girls entertained before an after their escape experience! It was more than I could have asked for! Thanks again!

We did the pirate room. It was super fun and we all had a great time. The puzzles are hard at times but not so hard you feel they're impossible. The place is immaculately clean. Staff is consistently nice, pleasant, and patient (I had called them a few times before our visit). Couldn't be happier! I'll be back!"
