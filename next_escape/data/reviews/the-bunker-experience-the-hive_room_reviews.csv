"Escape room ""Chapter 2: The Hive"" by The Bunker Experience in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-bunker-experience-the-hive,0,This was a fun experience. Highly interactive and pull you immediately into the story plot. There is a scare factor so come prepared. Also try to wear closed toe shoes since it's pretty dark in there. I'd definitely enjoyed this escape room and recommend everyone to give it a try!

I would definitely recommend doing it. We did chapter 1 and 2 back to back. If you have the time, definitely the way to go!"

I've always wanted to do an Escape Room and I'm so happy that we chose The Bunker Experience. We had a private event and we also elected catering by Pop Champagne, both were amazing! The 50-minute escape room was more challenging than expected but our group had loads of fun solving each puzzle and moving on to the next one. The whole experience was top-notch, highly recommended!"
