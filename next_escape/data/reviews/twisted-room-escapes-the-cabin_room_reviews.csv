"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Twisted Room Escapes in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/twisted-room-escapes-the-cabin,0,We have done around 25 escape rooms around the country and these are by far some of the best! We went to conquer The Submarine and stayed to complete the Missing Maestro and The Cabin. My personal favorite was the Cabin but all three were well planned and challenging! The four of us agreed that if you are in Indy looking for an escape room - this one has all the others beat by a mile.

The Cabin is on our top five rooms. We are close to exhaust all the rooms in Indy area and the Cabin definitely is the best room in indy area. The people who run this place are like a big family and the room is beautifully done. So much fun! We did all the other rooms right after and look forward to their new rooms in the future.
