Eric and the rest of the crew were super friendly and made it such a great experience. We did the Espionage room, which is a 30 minute room. It's fast-paced and exciting. It was the perfect warm up to the Area 52 room - an hour long room with lots of puzzles to solve. They book the room with just your party, so try it with a small group or a large one, either way you are in for a great time!"
