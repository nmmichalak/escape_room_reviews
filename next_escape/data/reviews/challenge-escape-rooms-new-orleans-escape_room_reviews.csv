"Escape room ""New Orleans Escape"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-new-orleans-escape,2,"This was the second challenge room I ever experienced. I entered with two friends and another group of four amazing humans! It was helpful to have many people involved in collaborating, asking questions and working together to bounce ideas and ask questions about the provided clues and props. At times, it is challenging to work in a small space, so it is important to communicate and share distinct roles for each member to have a valuable part in the problem/mystery-solving process. This was an amazing, rigorous and worthy escape room that pushed my academic, logical and critical thinking in a beautiful way! I highly recommend all humans to partake in this awesome challenge."
