"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Escape Room Mystery Cherry Hill in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-room-mystery-cherry-hill-the-egyptian-tomb,0,"Originally I was searching to visit Escape Rooms for about a year. None of them caught my attention like this one. I came across their website and immediately was drawn to the detailed artwork and how beautifully the themed rooms were put together. The ease of purchasing the tickets online was fast and hassle free. When i arrived the staff was very pleasant. In person the decor and artwork was just as beautiful. I went with my mother and son, but i can see this being just as fun with a bigger group participating as well. We chose the Egyptian Tomb which was AMAZING. I can't give details or it will spoil anyone's experience, all i can say is you really felt stuck in time. The room was challenging, but not too hard.(or easy) The fact you have only 60min. to get out made it even more fun. Alot of unexpected surprises. We did not escape but we were very close! We are planning to go back with an even bigger group and try again. This place is definitely worth going more than once!"

Everyone had a blast!  Owners were so patient and accommodating.  Definitely the best escape room we've been in so far, we can't wait to go back and try the other rooms."
