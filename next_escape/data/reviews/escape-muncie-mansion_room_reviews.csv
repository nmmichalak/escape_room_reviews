"Escape room ""Mansion"" by Escape Muncie in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/escape-muncie-mansion,0,The Mansion was challenging but so much fun! Having 7 people sure helped as we ALL played unique roles in this brain game! Our Center Chapel small group will be back!

The rooms were well done and the staff did an awesome job of really paying attention in order to help give you a nudge when necessary to help you along. The Mansion is the favorite room so far and we look forward to going back and trying the others!"
