"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-the-code,1,This place was awesome! We had a lot of fun and it was very challenging. Definitely want to go again and try out the other rooms.
"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-the-code,2,This was my second time doing an escape room and I have to say that Escapology was the best yet. We did the Code room and it was honestly really good. Even though we didn't finish in time our game host allowed us to finish because we were literally on the last clue. I would recommend this place to everyone. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Great experience!
"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-the-code,3,"This is a well-done escape room, the 4th one I've done personally. Everything worked according to design. The directions and puzzles in the room were straightforward. We did Th3 C0D3 room and really enjoyed ourselves. Escaped with just seconds to spare (only with 2 people). We did use all 3 clues to escape. I would definitely come back and try the other rooms."
