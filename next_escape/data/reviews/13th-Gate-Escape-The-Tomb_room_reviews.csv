"Escape room ""Tomb of Anubis"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-Gate-Escape-The-Tomb,0,I've done the Collector and Tomb of Anubis and absolutely loved both of them. The staff is so friendly and both rooms we did felt so real. The attention to detail is amazing. The puzzles were so fun and kept us entertained the entire time! Can't wait to go back and try more rooms.

We went through the collector room and everything was so well thought out and creative. The puzzles were clever and challenging and the aesthetics alone were beautifully gory and well placed. Two of us went and were skeptical about the randoms, but the necessity for teamwork makes you all besties by the end. We escaped and has so much fun doing so! We will DEFINITELY be back for more adventure!!"
