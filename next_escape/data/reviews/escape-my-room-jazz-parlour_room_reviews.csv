First escape room, wasnâ€™t sure what to expect but it was awesome. The room design is beautiful and the puzzles were fun to solve. Also thought the pacing of when the staff thought to send us hints was really good. Definitely want to go back for the other rooms!"

My friend and I had a blast looking for clues - the staff was awesome as well. We tried the Jazz Parlor and we actually made it to the 3rd room. Didn't escape but were close! Can't wait to do the Mardi Gras room soon! This is a must do!
