"Escape room ""Speakeasy"" by Escape The Puzzle in Long Branch",https://worldofescapes.com/long-branch/quests/escape-the-puzzle-speakeasy,0,"Escape the puzzle was fun and challenging! We had a team of 6 and escaped the Speakeasy with 51 seconds left! The storyline, rooms, and props are made with such creativity and originality. The puzzle is engaging the entire time and working as a team is key. The owners, Tina and Gabe, are very passionate about the games and their business and provide a great overall experience for everyone! We will definitely be returning in the near future to the Swamp!"

I would definitely recommend this place. Tina and Gabe were amazing! The room we did was the Speakeasy which was a lot of fun and very challenging.

We had a lot of fun and so many laughs! The clues were well thought out and creative.
