But I would love my picture up of that night and yeah I should've purchased the pic. Next time I will because that was a memorable night for us and we don't have anything to show for it. Thank you though for the great experience!!!

It was challenging and fun at the same time, definitely a good channel to build up relationships within the team. The staff and manager were both there and they were very friendly, explained everything in detail before we went in. Will definitely go back and try out the other rooms!!"
