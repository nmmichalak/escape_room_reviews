We are looking forward to coming back to do the football one! It was a little scary, but so much fun and we loved that there were multiple rooms to get through instead of just one! Great experience! We only had a group of 3, which I think made it even scarier!"

The clues were refreshingly different from other escape rooms I have done, and the story was just the right level of scary. Looking forward to trying their other room."

One thing we love about escape rooms is the puzzle part. My husband and I love trying to solve the clues and they are just a fun.Junkyard took it to a whole other level because it was more than just solving clues, it was an experience. You felt like you were apart of this scary, haunted hotel. It was very well thought out. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."
