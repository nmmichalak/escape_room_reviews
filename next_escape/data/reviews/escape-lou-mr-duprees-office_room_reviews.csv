"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape LOU in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/escape-lou-mr-duprees-office,0,"I went a few weeks ago with some friends to play Mr. Dupree's Office. We had a blast. The location is great! Right between the Hub and Bourbon Bistro and close to Comfy Cow. The building was clean and industrial and the lobby was nice to hang out in until the rest of our party showed up. Our host went the extra mile and really made the experience a great one for us.There were four of us and there were enough puzzles in the room to keep everyone occupied. At other escape rooms we've been to it's very linear where you have to solve one clue in order to progress to the next. But at Escape Lou there are multiple things to work on at once. After our mission we had a ""debrief"" and got to hear each person's contribution! I'd highly recommended checking out Escape Lou!"
