We did the Mad Hatter room because we are Alice in Wonderland fans. It was nothing short of awesome. They stuck to the riddle theme and made things not too hard, but definitely not easy. We successfully escaped the room! It was that something different that Sarasota needed to keep us all occupied, but still using our brains! We look forward to coming back and doing the Jail Break, as well as any additional rooms they open in the future!"

It was the first time we had ever done something like this but what an experience. We may not have finished in time because it was our first time. It definitely will not be our last time. I was hooked after the first 5 minutes or so. I have been telling everyone I know about this place and how they should try it. It was absolutely the best Birthday present ever.

We did the Mad Hatter room last night, for my daughter's 14th Birthday, and it was perfect! The staff was great and the whole experience was definitely one to remember. It was our first time and we went in a bit worried because the Jail Break group before us didn't make it out BUT, we escaped with just over 5 minutes to spare. And honestly, even if we hadn't made it out in time, it wouldn't have mattered because it was that fun. We'll be back!"
