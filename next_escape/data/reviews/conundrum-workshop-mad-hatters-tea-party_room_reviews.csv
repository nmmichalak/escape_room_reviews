Tried the Mad Hatter room. It was challenging and a lot of fun. Staff was very helpful. We have done escape rooms in various cities and this is among the best that we have done.
"Escape room ""Caterpillar's Garden"" by Conundrum Workshop in Bowling Green",https://worldofescapes.com/bowling-green/quests/conundrum-workshop-mad-hatters-tea-party,1,Five of us went for my birthday and we all had a blast. We did the Mad Hatter's Tea Party room and we escaped with almost 14 minutes left. One of our group couldn't make it and we were given a $20 gift card to make up for the unused spot. We will be back!

I was pleasantly surprised when my group did the Mad Hatter. The escape was challenging but not overly complicated and it was incredibly well done. We will be back for sure!

We had so much fun in The Mad Hatter room working together that all 8 instantly became a group of good friends! We got out with over 10 minutes to spare and already have plans to come back!
