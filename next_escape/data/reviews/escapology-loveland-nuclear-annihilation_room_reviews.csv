"Escape room ""Nuclear Annihilation"" by Escapology Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/escapology-loveland-nuclear-annihilation,0,"I liked my experience here last night. I came in here with my co-workers for the Nuclear Annihilation theme. Once in, we were allowed to drink any soda/water they had. The lobby is neat, and there are fun lil games to play as you wait for the group to assemble. Once we all were ready, we were given an explanation of the challenge, followed by a video briefing, and then led to our rooms. I thought that the puzzles were challenging enough. The flow of it wasn't smooth, thus making it difficult. A clue would connect to something seen way earlier, and in all, the mission was tricky. We were allowed to take help on the press of a button, which does aid. My group escaped with barely 8 minutes to spare. We were allowed to dress in variety of props for a picture, and call it a day. I'd recommend this place, for the staff, neat and quality of puzzles."
