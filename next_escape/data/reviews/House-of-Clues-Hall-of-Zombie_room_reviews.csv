"Escape room ""The Hall of Zombie"" by House of Clues in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/House-of-Clues-Hall-of-Zombie,0,"We did our annual work Christmas party here. They broke us up into 3 different rooms. We did Egypt, mystery and the zombie room. I did the zombie room, and let me tell you... it was intense! The zombie was awesome and totally scary. We all completed our rooms and ate dinner in the party room. Our hostess was very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a fun and positive experience."
