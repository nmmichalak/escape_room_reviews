"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-area-51,0,"I had never done a puzzle room before, but my boyfriend took me today. We had a blast! We tried the Area 51 room with just the two of us. I can see how at least 4 people would have made that room easier. Just the 2 of us did about 70% of the puzzle to solve the room before time ran out. We are totally coming back to try the other 2 rooms!"

This was our first time doing one of these and wasn't sure if our kids would be able to figure it out, but they did great. We accomplished with 1 minute to spare. We will be going back again for sure!"

We did the area 51 room and it was extremely well done, and we can't wait to try another. We were the last group of the night, and the owners treated us like we were the first of the day. You have to try this gem in little Winter Garden!"
"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-area-51,4,"Doing escape rooms has become a fun hobby after doing my first one about a year and a half ago. The room we did at Escape Goat (Area 51) was really fun and well themed with details that made the whole experience immersive and entertaining. I would highly recommend Escape Goat to any escape room enthusiast looking for their next escape game fix, or even newcomers. They have to start somewhere. Can't wait to go back. Would totally recommend!"
