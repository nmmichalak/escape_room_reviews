"Escape room ""Room #9"" by Trapped in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Trapped-Room-9,0,"Should be zero stars. Dog with worms (owner told us he had worms) was barking and ready to attack one man in our group. Booked for 5, owner left the building, didn't get started until 530. Needed help on a clue and knocked as we were told to 4 times, after no response we come out to no owner, I went to the business next door, they said he was just pulling back in. He had left the building, with his dog tied to the couch."

"Escape room ""Room #9"" by Trapped in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Trapped-Room-9,2,"It was a wonderful experience. We had so much fun, going in with a group of 6. Even though we did not solve it, we had a blast. The room decor, and effects in room 9 were very realistic and added to the experience. It was a bit hard to find the place, due to the sign being out but we managed to eventually find it."

We were locked in a room, and only had one hour to find clues and unlock the door... Definitely an experience worth having! Can't wait to go back and try the other puzzle room!!"
"Escape room ""Room #9"" by Trapped in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Trapped-Room-9,4,Did Room 9 tonight with a group of 8 family members and had a blast! The atmosphere in the room is fantastic. We escaped in about 45 minutes. Really makes you work together and think. The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. I would highly recommend Trapped to anyone looking for a fun and different experience.
