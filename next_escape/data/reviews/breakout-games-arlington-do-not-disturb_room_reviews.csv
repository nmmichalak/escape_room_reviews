It's was the majority of our 1st time but we worked together well and had a blast!! Can't wait until our next adventure!!!"
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Arlington in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/breakout-games-arlington-do-not-disturb,1,"This was my first time ever doing an escape room. We went with our church pastoral team as a team building exercise. We really had a great time. We did the ""kidnap"" escape. It was a lot harder than I anticipated. There was a lot of number crunching involved in this particular escape. Ultimately we didn't escape in the allotted time, but we all had a lot of fun trying. I will totally be doing this again. Will probably bring my family for a family night out."

It was hard but not too hard and we worked together to escape. There were a variety of puzzles and the story flowed and made sense.

They are all so fun! The puzzles are challenging but not super difficult. We have made it out of all of them with a few minutes to spare! Do Not Disturb is the newest one and it is fantastic!! Highly recommend this place for a fun date night!"
