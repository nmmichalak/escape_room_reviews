"Escape room ""Egyptian Tomb Escape"" by Katy Rock Escape in Windsor",https://worldofescapes.com/windsor/quests/katy-rock-escape-egyptian-tomb-escape,0,"We conquered Pharoah's Tomb! We found out about Katy Rock Escape after a search for a rainy day activity... and it was a definite highlight for our trip. We brought our three children, ages 6, 10 and 13. Everyone was able to participate in many elements. It was a fun challenge to do as a family. We have been to escape rooms in KC, but this was even better and more affordable! Thank you, Katy Rock Escape!"
