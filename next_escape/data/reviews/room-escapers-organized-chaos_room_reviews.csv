"Escape room ""Organized Chaos"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/room-escapers-organized-chaos,0,"We had a great time. Our group has done escapade rooms all over the country and this one was quite good. We did the Organized Chaos and it was not a traditional escape room, it was more solve multiple crimes/puzzles which was a great spin on the whole idea. We loved it. My only comment is a couple of things did not open when we did things correctly, which held us up from completely solving it, but we are able to complete 90% of everything and had a great score when finished.I would highly recommend these guys!"

I tried the Organized Chaos room first, then went back for the Panacea one. Both were a ton of fun. Panacea was a bit harder than Organized but our host was very helpful in giving clues whenever we asked. Both of them have really fun, interesting and stimulating puzzles.Definitely recommend for a fun time with a group of friends!"
"Escape room ""Organized Chaos"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/room-escapers-organized-chaos,2,"We've done both Pirates Booty II and Organized Chaos and found both to be some of the best rooms we've found in Boston. The atmosphere is immersive and the puzzles are challenging but logical. You'll tend towards many ""ah-ha"" moments when you finally get the elegant solution and kick yourself for missing it the first time around. We were able to get out of both under the time with a few supportive but not obvious clues. Overall, great experience. Highly recommend."
