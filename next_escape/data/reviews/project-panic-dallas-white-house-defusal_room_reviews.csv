"Escape room ""White House Defusal"" by Project Panic Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/project-panic-dallas-white-house-defusal,0,Project panic was an extremely exciting and fun experience!!! I came here with a couple of friends (group of 5) and we tried the White House defusal room. I really enjoyed the backstory they gave to the room which tied in very nicely with the layout of the room and the clues in it. The clues itself in the room very creative and very high tech and I was consistently surprised at the level of quality of the props that were used. You could see the amount of time and effort the creators put into making it.The room was exciting and challenging and my friends i were able to just escape! Our operator Robert was also very helpful whenever we got stuck on certain clues. (Give him a raise! Haha) we really enjoyed our time here and would definitely come back and check out the other rooms!

It requires teamwork, a lot of brain power, and the use of a lot of creative thinking. The room was a lot of fun and weâ€™d definitely go again."

Our game master made it a lot of fun. We did the White House with 3 people. Puzzles were fun to figure out. Challenging but we were able to get out in time. Would love to come back to do another room.
