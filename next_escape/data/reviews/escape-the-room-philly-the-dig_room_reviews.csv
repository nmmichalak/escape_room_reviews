"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-the-room-philly-the-dig,0,"A solid group activity. We went and did ""the dig"" and found it amazing to work together. A great way to get to know other people by trying to escape together.Staff was great, our clue master Paloma was comprehensive with instructions and was forgiving even when we did stupid things. She helped us (we needed it a lot) and made the experience complete. Really an awesome time!"

He had a great and well rehearsed presentation, 5 stars for that alone!The Dig was my second escape the room concept and I have to say this room was brilliant!!Granted my teammates are all clever and bright people, so we did escape in under 40 mins, but I loved how the pieces fit together (literally and figuratively) and there  were many surprises.If you have a love for mysteries and adventure....you will absolutely LOVE this room :)"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-the-room-philly-the-dig,2,We went last night for my best friends bachelorette. There were 8 of us with the dig booked and we had 2 random people join us. It was great we all worked together and had an awesome time. The staff was great and gave us hints when needed and we escaped with 12 minutes to spare! Would love to go back and try the other rooms. Great group activity.

Completely different from anything I've ever done in my life, and it was incredible! We went with a full group of ten and did ""the dig"". First off, Dexter, our host was amazing. Incredibly helpful, funny, and professional. The puzzles were very difficult to figure out but when you work together as a team you can do it! We finished the room with 13 minutes to spare! Dexter will explain that on the monitor you will periodically receive hints to help you along. I can't describe what sorts of puzzles were included because that would take out the fun and mystery! All I can say is that this experience has brought my friends a lot closer than we previously were!"

This time we got out with 5 mins left on the clock! Can't wait till the bank vault is ready and then we will be back!"
