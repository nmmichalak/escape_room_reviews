"Escape room ""The Cage, the Cards, and the Cash"" by PanIQ Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/paniq-escape-room-nyc-the-cage,0,Had an amazing fun time escaping the Wild West room. The people working there are so friendly. My friends and I end up trying the Perfect Crime on the same day and that was also very interesting and fun. Wish I could go back in time and do it all over again!
"Escape room ""The Cage, the Cards, and the Cash"" by PanIQ Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/paniq-escape-room-nyc-the-cage,1,"Loved this place. We played the Wild West room with 6 people and it was a perfect number. The space is clean and open, and the room itself was themed well and had tons of details. I canâ€™t wait to come back and try their other rooms! Andrew, the staffer for the day was knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. He made our experience by explaining things well and taking our group photo at the end. Come and visit this place!"

We didn't make it out on time but we had a lot of fun. The game started on time and Andrew explained everything we needed to know to begin and when we were done, he explained the clues we missed and steps required in order to get out. Again, lots of fun and I would definitely recommend!"
