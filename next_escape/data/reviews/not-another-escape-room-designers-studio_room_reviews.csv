"Escape room ""Designer's Studio"" by Not Another Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/not-another-escape-room-designers-studio,0,"Oh great...not another escape room.... but hey, I'm not complaining!There's plenty of parking since it's on the border of a neighborhood and business area.My team of 4 did their ""Designer's Studio"" room, but we really wanted to do their ""Unicorn"" room instead. Unfortunately, the room had some technical issues so we ended up doing the ""Designer's Studio"" instead.Luckily, we weren't disappointed at all. Though the puzzles are mostly gen 1 puzzles, made of locks and other gen 1 mechanics, there were actually gen 1 puzzles that were unique to that room that we had never seen before. I've done almost 150 rooms, and it's always fun to see new puzzles and there were plenty of new ones for me to see this time around too.Their games and wording are quite clever, so pay attention to those.Though the games are private games, I would recommend a team of 2 to 4 for more experience teams, and 4 or more for less experience teams."
