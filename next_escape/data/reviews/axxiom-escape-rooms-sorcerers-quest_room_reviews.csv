"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Quest"" by Axxiom Escape Rooms in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/axxiom-escape-rooms-sorcerers-quest,0,Amazing! Had a blast in the Sorcerers room. Can't wait to be back to do more.
"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Quest"" by Axxiom Escape Rooms in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/axxiom-escape-rooms-sorcerers-quest,1,"We went to the Sorcerers Dragons Lair. The room was so well decorated it was not hard at all to become immersed in the adventure. Some good effects added to the scene and a few surprises as well. We divided and conquered, working on each of our strengths. A very interesting logic puzzle nearly undid us near the end, but we prevailed! An informative discussion with the operator allowed us to learn even more so we can work on more difficult adventures next time... and we will be back!"
"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Quest"" by Axxiom Escape Rooms in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/axxiom-escape-rooms-sorcerers-quest,2,The Sorcerer's Quest room exceeded all expectations. It was like actually stepping into the Headmaster's office. The puzzles were challenging but not frustrating. It was a magical and fun experience and I want to do it again!

Our family was not able to get out of the Pirates Cove room, but we did get to the last clue so we had a shot. Lots of cool tech in the room, only a few manual locks. Good for a smaller group.The second room was Sorcerer’s Quest - The Dragon’s Lair. Our two young children loved it. We were able to get out with about four minutes to go. This room was all tech locks and actions, and had some interesting concepts we’ve not seen before (and I have done 53 rooms).Bill the owner is very personable and the staff is friendly. Thank you for an enjoyable time."
