"Escape room ""Lockdown"" by Digital Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/digital-escape-rooms-lockdown,2,Went with a group tonight and escaped successfully! Great set up with mixing hands on puzzles along with digital ones. Wasn't a single dull moment even while waiting for our turn. Lots of fun games to play just around the lobby. Great experience and will definitely be coming back. Would highly recommend for all age groups!
