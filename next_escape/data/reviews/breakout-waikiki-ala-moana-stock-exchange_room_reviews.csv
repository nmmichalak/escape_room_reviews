"Escape room ""Ala Moana Stock Exchange"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-ala-moana-stock-exchange,4,"I think I can speak for our entire group that we had SUCH a great time. We did one room, then after having so much fun, had to do the other. Both had a few ""holy crap"" moments (I'm carefully trying not to spoil) that turned a simple puzzler into a true experience. I would completely recommend it to others, and plan to be back when their next room is set up."
