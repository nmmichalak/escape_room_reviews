"Escape room ""West"" by Timed Out in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/timed-out-west,0,"First time trying an escape room and we had so much fun! With our friends and 9 year old son, and being a first timer, we didn't want to go to the ones with sound effects or anything that can be too scary for the kids and the west room was a perfect choice. Our gamemaster Brandon was very helpful and made sure we had fun without getting stuck! I definitely recommend Timed Out escape room for families with kids. With a few different rooms at various difficulty levels, it will also be great for experienced adults who like to be challenged!!"
"Escape room ""West"" by Timed Out in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/timed-out-west,1,Awesome experience. My wife and I have done a lot of escape rooms so took on west by ourselves. Well done room with A lot of fun puzzles. More of a beginner room for 4 but perfect for 2 veterans. Carlos was our game master and did a wonderful job. I like the nudge concept so we never got frustrated on a puzzle. Will be back with friends to try the other rooms.

Such a fun way to spend an hour with friends. Challenging and well thought out. Required a true team effort. We shared so many laughs. Shout out to Thomas for being a fantastic game master! "
