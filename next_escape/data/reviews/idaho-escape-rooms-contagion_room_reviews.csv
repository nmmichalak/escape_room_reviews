"Escape room ""Contagion"" by Idaho Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/idaho-escape-rooms-contagion,0,"We loved it! We had family in town, age 7-70. We did Contagion and really had a good time. Everyone was able to participate and work toward the solution. So nice to interact rather than watch a movie. And if you get stuck, ask for a hint! I would definitely go again."
"Escape room ""Contagion"" by Idaho Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/idaho-escape-rooms-contagion,1,We had so much fun helping contain the virus! This was my first experience and I had no idea what to expect! It exceeded my expectations for sure! I highly recommend trying this! The staff was great... we had such a fun time!
"Escape room ""Contagion"" by Idaho Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/idaho-escape-rooms-contagion,2,"We had a frantic time trying to save the world. Despite our combined intellect and frenzy, we failed and the world died. That's not to say we didn't have fun watching the world succumb to a killer virus. The puzzles were intricate, difficult, and complex. It felt satisfying solving each step because of how weird the solution often was. "
"Escape room ""Contagion"" by Idaho Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/idaho-escape-rooms-contagion,3,"Great puzzles that don't rely on open this lock to find this key to open this box to find a code, etc etc. There were some really innovative puzzles and many were really hands on, which I enjoy. There were enough different puzzles that could be worked on that we weren't falling over each others' feet or staring around with nothing to do. The staff members were kind and helpful. I did the Contagion Room and am excited to find opportunities to try the other two rooms."
