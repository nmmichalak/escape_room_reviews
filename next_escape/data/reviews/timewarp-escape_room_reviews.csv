"Escape room ""Timewarp Escape"" by Timewarp Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/timewarp-escape,0,"This is my 3rd escape room in the Boulder/Denver area. The best thing about Timewarp Escape is the theme. If you love the 80's, you'll love this escape room. It's on par with other high rated escape rooms but with the 80's theme, it makes it all the more fun with the excellent 80's throwbacks. Fun times and highly recommended."
"Escape room ""Timewarp Escape"" by Timewarp Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/timewarp-escape,1,"We had so much fun! This room was challenging enough that it took us almost the full hour but was also designed to be fun, engaging and hopefully guide you to success. If you love the 80's or are just looking for a fun group activity, I highly recommend it."
"Escape room ""Timewarp Escape"" by Timewarp Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/timewarp-escape,2,We do escape rooms regularly and I can honestly say this room was the most fun. We dressed up and everything! It really brought back memories from the 80's! But the best thing was the owner-operator. He made this experience that 5-star level. I would highly definitely recommend this place.
