"Escape room ""Sugar Rush"" by Exit Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/exit-escape-room-sugar-rush,0,"We did the sugar rush room with 3 people and it was tons of fun!!  The puzzles took each of our unique ways of puzzle solving to complete.  We used all 5 senses to solve the puzzles.  The taste, smell and listen puzzles were a blast.  The staff was very helpful and friendly and he gave some good hints during the game.  I want to go again!!"
