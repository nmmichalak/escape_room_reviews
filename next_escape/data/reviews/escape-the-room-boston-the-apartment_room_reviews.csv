"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-the-room-boston-the-apartment,0,"I did the Apartment here and overall it was a fun experience. The puzzles seemed like the right amount of difficulty and the progression was good. My problem with this place is how old some of the puzzles are. Some of them malfunctioned and we felt like we solved puzzles in vain because the thing that was supposed to open just did.People were nice and the decor was alright. They will throw out clues to you every now and then if they see that you're stuck. This isn't the most elaborate escape the rooms I've ever been in but that's okay. Overall, it was a good experience!"

We managed to escape! However, the experience was just alright. One of the clues was broken so we had to be given the answer by the game controller. Because we did not know the other group or have to mingle - the experience was frustrating with people running around looking for clues.I'd say this is good for corporate events/with a big a group of friends - but would not recommend going as a small group as you never know what other group you'd be put in with."

The biggest disappointment was that there was no story. You are simply locked in the apartment and told you have an hour to get out. Compared to the other rooms I've done, it really lacked story.This room was just sitting there with no story and no personality. A bunch of puzzles that didn't seem at all related to each other. There were a few clever locks, and I do like the overall escape room experience, but for $30 a head, I expect a better story or theme or integrated experience."

Nice place!!! Something different to do !!!!! Love it definitely coming back!"
