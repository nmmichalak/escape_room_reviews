"Escape room ""Stash House"" by Stash House in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/stash-house,1,"Ok, I've found a new room that is now in my TOP THREE!Stash House is so, so much more than an ""escape room"". I felt like I was in a movie and the immersion factor was off the charts. This is a perfect experience for a lot of friends (I tend to cap my group at 4), but I love that this experience gets everyone involved at all times. Everything made sense and flowed beautifully.This was the 117th room I've played and words can't begin to describe this whole experience. They've got an awesome thing going here and I'm sure many more reviews will concur. Escape rooms should follow suit of what this company has got going for them."
"Escape room ""Stash House"" by Stash House in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/stash-house,2,"Stash House is probably my favorite escape room so far!! Instead of escaping, the challenge is to find all the drugs in the house and flush them down the toilet before the cops arrive! The puzzles were very challenging and so well crafted! Iâ€™d definitely recommend a bigger group of 6-8 or so."
