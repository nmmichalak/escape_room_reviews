"Escape room ""Assassin's Deadly Game"" by Hour to Midnight in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Hou-to-Midnight-Assassin-s-Deadly-Game,0,We have done quite a few rooms in the Portland area and Assassin's Deadly Game at Hour to Midnight is by far our favorite. We found the staff to be friendly and engaging and the game master was fun to work with. The room itself was highly polished with a good number of unique and intuitive puzzles. We left energized and found ourselves talking about the puzzles for hours afterward. That's a sign of a great escape room. We will be returning soon to play Niburu.

Had the time of our lives! Our guide Ken was encouraging and engaging with us throughout the whole experience. He added immensely to the fun and is extremely talented at his job. Days after the experience we were still talking about it and left wanting more.  We will definitely return to experience the other rooms and scenarios."

Excellent experience. Very fun, extremely well done, high quality and well thought out props and a very enthusiastic owner of the business. I recommend!"
