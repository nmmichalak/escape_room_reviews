"Escape room ""The Abnormal Studie"" by Escape Tactics in Wenatchee",https://worldofescapes.com/wenatchee/quests/escape-tactics-the-abnormal-studie,0,"Having done several other escape rooms, I can honestly say the Abnormal Studie is one of the best I've done anywhere. Immersive theming, creative puzzles, and an excellent host made for an outstanding escape adventure. The creators really know what goes into an excellent escape room experience, and more importantly what doesn't. In what has become an ""anyone can build an escape room"" market, this is a rare gem hidden in Central Washington. We'll be back for Das Feast next time!"
