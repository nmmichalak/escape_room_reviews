"Escape room ""End Run"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-end-run,0,"My family has done escape rooms around the world and the theming and experience of End Run was very good. The puzzles are multi-linear, so there was always something for everyone to work on, and the multi-room puzzles required top tier communication. There were many types of puzzles and it took our entire group to get through. Bring your A game to this room!"

I didn't realize the event would take an entire 60 minutes (which felt like an eternity). The concept is cool, however the clues did not interconnect, were difficult, and didn't really follow the theme.  This room was assigned the maximum persons suggested and some became uninterested and tuned out."

Andrew was friendly, gave great advice, and was very accommodating. I really appreciate his style of leading the game, giving clues, and also making us feel welcome. I pushed back my start time for my reservation via phone. Escape Room was flexible to make that change. Then, I accidentally made it there late. When we got there, Andrew helped explain the game to us and made sure we were off to a great start. My friends and I played the End Run one, and there were several pieces to the game to make it engaging, complex, and team-focused. Thanks again to Escape Rooms HQ for the great experience and to Andrew for being a wonderful gamemaster. Cheers!"

This was also fun because Evan previously worked with Enron in college as an intern, so there were some funny moments for us. This was just great, and the owner takes a real care in the quality of the room and the experience. Looking forward to more of their rooms - a really great experience. Theme:This was a fun theme and very well executed.Quality:Very well put together, with some challenges that really test your communication skills.Difficulty:Definitely one of the trickier rooms we've done, complete with a puzzle that neither of us excels at but will be practicing.Fun:There was a lot of adrenaline and fun to be had."
