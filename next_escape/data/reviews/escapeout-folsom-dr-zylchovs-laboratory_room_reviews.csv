"Escape room ""Dr. Zylchov's Laboratory"" by EscapeOut Folsom in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escapeout-folsom-dr-zylchovs-laboratory,1,"Went to Escape Out in Folsom on mother's day as a group of 4 and played the lab room. The designers made great use of the space they had to work with. The room was definitely on the smaller side but it was very well done. All of us each had opportunities to solve our own puzzle and the payoff for winning was super entertaining! Definitely looking forward to going back, my only hope is that the other room(s) are bigger and/or multi room experiences."

Very easy to book our time/day via their website which was awesome. We chose the Laboratory room which was their easier of the 4 rooms with a 50/50 success rate. My kids, wife and myself all had an amazing time and really can't wait to experience the other rooms. The host that helped us is a real asset to this place. He was very personable and his acting the part of the laboratory staff was a great addition to the experience. I highly recommend EscapeOut in Folsom if you are looking for something fun to do with friends, family and/or coworkers. BTW, We Escaped with 3 mins left!"
