Made you use your noggin and tested your ability to read between the lines, but wasn't so impossible that you didn't keep figuring things out til you were able to escape. Would definitely go back!"

I was there yesterday, January 31st, and the place was really cool. Had a great time with my family and guess what? Hines Ward, Steelers Great, was there with his family. Double treat for me because I love Escape Rooms and am a lifelong Steelers fan! Never know who might be in your room with you when you go through."

We had THE most amazing time! We made it to the last puzzle, but didn't get out in time. Now we are hooked and ended up staying to do the Desert Storm room. Very challenging but we made it out of this one with minutes to spare! So exciting and brain exercising, perfect place for a second or third date."
