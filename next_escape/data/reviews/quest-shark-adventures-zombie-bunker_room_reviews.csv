First from a Zombie Bunker where we found a cure, then from a Tesla room where we closed a portal so creatures couldn't get through... Great birthday, great people, great decor & puzzles!! We definitely plan to go back and complete the other rooms!! Thanks for a great night!"
"Escape room ""Zombie Bunker"" by Escape Zone Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/quest-shark-adventures-zombie-bunker,3,Our family recently had an outstanding time escaping the room at Quest Shark Adventures! We were one of the lucky ones that tried out a new zombie-theme experience and it was so cool and different. I believe some escape room places can learn from Quest because they have it right when it comes to having a good mix of puzzles/riddles/etc.  Really nice hosts too! Thank you Max and company for an awesome time! Highly recommended!!!!
