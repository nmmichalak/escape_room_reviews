"Escape room ""O’Bannions Safe"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-obannions-safe,0,"This was my first experience with escape rooms, but I can't see how it could get any better. My friends and I went to start off my Bachelorette party. I cannot say enough good things about this place -- the theme was fun, the clues were clever, it was challenging (but not too challenging), and we CRUSHED the all time high score by almost 16 minutes. Anyone who likes escape rooms MUST try this one. You won't be disappointed!!"
"Escape room ""O’Bannions Safe"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-obannions-safe,1,"There are so many parts to this room, I don't know where to start. First, the decorations and props are great - even the door to the room adds to the design. We really had to pay attention to the clues along the way, and we did have a hard time figuring a few out because we were paying attention to the wrong things. Theme:There are such cool props and set pieces in here, and the story is well thought out. Each time we finished something, there was another surprise coming.Quality:Very nicely done and in great shape - love how well things worked.Difficulty:Things really built on themselves over time - it started out very easy and then got more interesting and complex as we moved through.Fun:At first, things seemed easy, but then they just got fun. Nice, creative puzzles and stories inside."
"Escape room ""O’Bannions Safe"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-obannions-safe,2,"This is their ""easiest"" room but don't assume that doesn't mean it won't be a challenge. We needed every second of our 60 minutes to complete it, and then some! Because this was our first escape room, we actually initially wanted to do something harder afraid this one would be too easy. But escape rooms aren't about your intelligence level, they are about having an experienced understanding of what to look for and how to solve them. Just because it's their easiest does not make it easy, and we were told that many don't complete it. This room was probably my favorite, there were a ton of twists and turns we didn't expect and we found ourselves getting more and more excited as we worked through the room. "
