"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Lake Elsinore in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/escapology-lake-elsinore-mansion-murder,0,"Had a seriously great night here with my friends! I'd definitely recommend this place. Everything was well decorated which made the atmosphere perfect. We chose the Mansion Murder room and managed to solve the puzzle! However, we wouldn't have been able to do that without Chris and Rayleen, the wonderful people who helped us along the way. Our game master Chris was seriously the best! The clues he gave us and words of encouragement made finding the solution that much more rewarding. I had a lot of fun and I look forward to coming back next time for a different room!"

Was very impressed when we got there. The lobby is very comfortable, thwre is a table full puzzles and there is a huge bar and additional tables as well. We did Mansion Murder for my daughter's birthday. I waited in the lobby for the full hour and was very comfortable. The girls didnt make it out but had a ton of fun. Definitely will go back! "
