"Escape room ""Blast from the Past"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-blast-from-the-past,0,I went with my sister and father.  It was just the three of us.  We played the museum and blast from the past.  Both rooms were challenging but super fun.  I want to go back and try their other rooms.

The people were very nice, laid back and funny. I love that it's near an entrance in the mall so you don't have to deal with mall traffic. We did the blast from the past room and it was sooooo cool. Also, this is the only escape room place that I have seen that only has you pay for 4 people to rent out the whole room out instead of paying for 10 spaces. I will be back to do every room!"

The first time we tried Bomb Squad. The group my mom and I joined was fun. We used teamwork. We communicated with each other when we found a clue.The second time I brought my aunt's and we played Blast from the Past. The three people that joined us, kept to themselves, used their phone to help with the clue, and didn't want us to help with the one puzzle. We did not make it. My aunt's and I still had fun.If you join a public game, you have to communicate with your teammates. It will make the experience much better."
