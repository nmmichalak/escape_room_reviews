It was young kids friendly and we all had a fun time. The theme is good for both adults and kids. It was adorable and colorful theme. The clues were helpful and interesting. The difficult level is intermediate, not too hard, not too easy. We just got out in the last minute. It was a fun experience for all of us. We will definitely book other rooms next time."
