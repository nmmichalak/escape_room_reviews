We solved The Royal Heist with 13 seconds to spare. What a total blast.
"Escape room ""The Royal Heist"" by EscapeXperience Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapexperience-escape-room-the-royal-heist,1,First time at an Escape Room. We had a great time. We did the Royal Heist and found it to be challenging and fun. One thing though-one of the rooms of the 3 in this challenge is better suited to smaller folks. If you have a child in your party or other smaller people youâ€™ll have an advantage.

It was fun and the puzzles were neat. We completed the Royal Heist with a few minutes to spare. The only complaint is that it was super hot inside of the business and being put in a room with 10 people and no air conditioning began to wear on everyone.

Definitely going to try the other two rooms. Justin was so helpful and it was great to have a friendly voice helping us out because we needed it. In the end, we finished with two and a half minutes to spare. Thanks for a great Friday night!"

It was our first escape room. We did the Royal Heist and made it out, with only 58 seconds to spare. We were told this was a good one for beginners. It's an older outdated building, but the experience made up for it. Our host was great!! His clues were fun but still kept it challenging. We're ready to try another room at EscapeXperience."
