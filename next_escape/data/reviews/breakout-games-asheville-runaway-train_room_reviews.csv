"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Asheville in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/breakout-games-asheville-runaway-train,0,"My college roomates came to visit us in western NC and we spent 5 days showing them the area. Breakout Games was one of the highlights of the trip! We did Runaway Train with 6 adults, 4 had never done an escape room and were a little hesitant. Everyone had a great time! Runaway Train is very well done, challenging but fun,and Miguel,our Game Mastet, was great! He was patient, friendly and gave just enough help when needed. We'll definately return, I can't wait to take my kids!"
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Asheville in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/breakout-games-asheville-runaway-train,1,"You're on a train that's been overtaken by terrorists. There's a bomb on board. You have to get into the front of the train, stop it, and release the doors to let all the passengers escape before the bomb explodes.And it isn't easy. Honestly, if it wasn't for Miguel, Game Master Extraordinaire, we would have been blown to bits.Don't get me wrong. The puzzles were fun to decipher, but they were challenging. And the codes we needed to unlock mysterious suitcases and cabinets were not obvious. At times, we had clues spread all around us, but had no idea how to use them. But Miguel was beyond helpful and a fun guy besides.Plus, I have to admit... every time we figured out a clue and a lock clicked open -- or a hidden compartment was revealed -- it was so satisfying. And figuring out that last clue with just two minutes to spare was pure joy. And relief. (Honestly, I thought we were dead.)So go for it. Take your shot at stopping the Runaway Train and saving the day. Just be ready for some challenges. Make use of all the hints your Game Master gives you. And prepare to have some fun."

We've never really done one of these before. Our gamemaster, Miguel, was fantastic. He provided just the right amount of hints so we could progress. The puzzle was somewhat hard, but rewarding in the end. We were able to finish in the allotted time with a little to spare.We had 4 people total which I think was the right amount of people. No one sat idle and I think if there were 6 or more, that may occur. I wouldn't necessarily want to do these all the time due to the price, but if doing it with friends were everyone pitched in then it would be better.Over, nice folks running the games and in e facility."

Planned this for my friend's bachelorette event and the team (Travis and Bonnie) was so accommodating. Our activities for the day did not go as planned and everything was delayed to the point we didn't know when we'd show up but Travis was able to reschedule us SEVERAL times since it wasn't super busy that night. We did the Runaway Train and Bonnie, our game master, did such a wonderful job from introducing us to the room to guiding us through the entire escape... We were for sure not the brightest group but we managed to finish because of Bonnie. This event was a total hit for us and we could not stop talking about it afterward!!"

Our group did the Runaway Train with 1min. 36 seconds to spare. Whew! We loved our room leader. I don't remember his name but he was not only professional but fun too. As a side note, I am claustrophobic and being in there didn't bother me at all. Don't let that stop you! Great experience."
