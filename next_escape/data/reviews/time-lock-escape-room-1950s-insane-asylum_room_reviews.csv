"Escape room ""1950's Insane Asylum"" by Time Lock Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/time-lock-escape-room-1950s-insane-asylum,0,This escape room was so much fun! My family and I did the Asylum and it was challenging but not so much that we weren't able to complete it. The rooms were realistic and the story behind the room was great!

It can be difficult with a group of nine, but we ended up making it out (with clues, for sure). It was evident a lot of work has gone into making these rooms unique, and the ambiance definitely contributed to the theme of the room. We did the Asylum and had a blast. Will definitely be back to try out the others."
