"Escape room ""The Dark Room"" by ROOM 5280 in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/room-5280-seattle-the-dark-room,0,"My partner and I tried out the Dark Room as a group of two. Antonio, our friendly host with the sunflower shirt, was very relaxed and provided clues when needed. From this we were able to finish with 5 minutes to spare.There were some puzzles that need to be slightly tweaked (without clues they would be practically impossible or random). One of these was particularly knob 1 not having an associated instruction.Overall however we really enjoyed the experience and would come back for The Experiment with a group of friends."

Super attentive and the experience was excellent. We did the Dark Room, family of 4 (15,18, 47, 51 respectively). It took us right to the last minute and it was so fun!!! Very challenging but super fun!"

My husband, 13-year-old son, and I were visiting Seattle and had a truly great time doing our first escape room together at Room 5280. We did The Dark Room scenario and the hour flew by. The owner was so cool and gave us clues at the right times, which was nice for us beginners. The Dark Room was mysterious and kept us very intrigued and entertained for the hour. We got pretty far! Now we have the bug and want to try more escape rooms. Next we will try The Experiment when we return to Seattle. The prices are right and it's an excellent way to spend an hour. We highly recommend Room 5280!"
