"Escape room ""The Cloning Experiment"" by Code Breakers in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/code-breakers-the-cloning-experiment,0,"Enjoyed a visit to Code Breakers earlier this year while friends were in town and it did not disappoint!All of the staff was very friendly and the room that we had (Clone Experiment) had a varied set of puzzles that were different from the other escape rooms that we had done around the city. Lots of neat special effects, different ways to interact with the room, and enough for a full team of 8 to keep busy for 45 minutes with little downtime for any member. Looking forward to heading back there soon."
