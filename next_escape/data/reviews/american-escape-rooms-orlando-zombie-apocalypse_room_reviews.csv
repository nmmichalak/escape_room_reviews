"Escape room ""Zombie Apocalypse"" by American Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/american-escape-rooms-orlando-zombie-apocalypse,0,"If you like a billion locks and keys one after the other, then this is the place for you. Beware of faulty tools. We spent around 10-15 minutes on a single lock. We were extremely confused why it wouldn’t open! Come to find out that the lock was broken!  We did not get our time back And made us question every lock we came across (which were ALOT). The second room we encountered also had a wonky tool that wouldn’t work properly and that also took us around 10-15 minutes to move on. This was to the point we were asked if we needed someone to come in. It is unfortunate because the concepts were cool and interesting and the workers were enthusiastic and friendly. After 2 encounters with a faulty item, it is safe to say we will not be going back here."
