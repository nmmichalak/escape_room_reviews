Even with the hiring process. They encourage no ""thugs"" or ""punks"" to apply. How do you know if someone is a Thug without judging them. JUST SAD IN 2018 This is still happening. will post negative craigslist they posted on yelp & google."
"Escape room ""Curse of Dracula: Destroy the Vampire!"" by Escape Adventures in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/escape-adventures-curse-of-dracula,1,Love this place! We've done other escape rooms before but the ambiance and puzzles in this one are the favorites. The Dracula one is hard which was great.The guy working here is very passionate about his escape room. He designed each room and has a very creative approach. I highly recommend this place. So fun!
"Escape room ""Curse of Dracula: Destroy the Vampire!"" by Escape Adventures in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/escape-adventures-curse-of-dracula,2,"My friends and I just escaped from Dracula's Curse, and it was a great time! I've done several escape/clue rooms, and this was one of the best. Clever clues and effects were woven into the story of the room. It was eerie in the very best way - not too scary, but a good setting for the adventure. It was very challenging (although, we did break out - yay us!) I can't wait to try the other Escape Adventures. Highly recommended!"

We have done many escape rooms and this one was so fun! Don't let the outside of the place steer you away. We did the Dracula room and it was a great theme and great puzzles. Enjoyed chatting with the friendly staff about escape rooms! We will definitely be back!

The Dracula room was very well thought out, and even though we didn't escape, it definitely had our brains going. The owner was super friendly and was willing to let us tour the place to see his upcoming ideas. We had a blast! It caters to all age groups and I would highly recommend it!"

My group did the Dracula's Curse room; it was the perfect combination of challenging puzzles, immersive narrative, haunting atmosphere, and spooky fun. When we got there, we were only a small group, but the owners, who were very kind and welcoming, paired us up with a couple who wanted to do the same room, and we had a great time. I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!"
