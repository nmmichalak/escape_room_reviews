Our host was Elizabeth and she was an excellent guide! I have never participated in a group like this. It was challenging, engaging and fun and zap times scary!!!! I would recommend this Room for others to try. Builds teamwork in a fun way!!! "
"Escape room ""The Paranormal Experiment"" by ClockWise Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clockwise-escape-room-the-paranormal-experiment,1,"I loved this escape room! My friend and I joined another group of six and they came really late so our game master let us start early and they even offered to step in if a puzzle required more than 2 people which was really nice of them! Eventually our team eventually did show up so we didn't end up needing any help.We did the paranormal room and the production value was great! But it is very dark and you're only lit by the flashlights you're given so be prepared for that. Though it is creepy, it isn't too scary so besides from the occasional loud noise, you shouldn't be expecting any jump scares. And also you get unlimited hints, so that's great, our game master was very helpful and we definitely made use of those hints. Some puzzle do require things to be just right when you do them so that did lead to a bit of confusion in different parts. But other than that it was great and a lot of creepy fun! We got out with just a minute to spare!"
