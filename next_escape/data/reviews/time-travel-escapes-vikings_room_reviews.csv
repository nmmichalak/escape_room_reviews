"Escape room ""Vikings"" by Time Travel Escapes in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/time-travel-escapes-vikings,2,The owners of this place are very friendly and bring a great place for teens/friends/families to hang out for a fun hour. I like how they have a green room to take a picture of your group after you have played that will go along with your games theme. This is one of the better escape rooms I have been to.
