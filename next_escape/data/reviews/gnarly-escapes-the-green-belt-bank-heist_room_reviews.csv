"Escape room ""The Green Belt Bank Heist"" by Gnarly Escapes in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/gnarly-escapes-the-green-belt-bank-heist,1,Went twice in the same day. Very well set up. Love the concept. Most escape rooms you are trying to get out at as soon as possible. This one you're trying to stay in as long as possible while trying to solve the clues to get the most loot from the Vault. Makes it more intense. Who doesn't love a good bank Heist!
