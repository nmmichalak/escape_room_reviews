"Escape room ""Explorer Room"" by Dare Escape Rooms in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/dare-escape-rooms-explorer-room,1,So much fun in the Explorer room! Our host always knew when we needed a little nudging in the right direction. I liked the intricacies of the room and how one hint leads to another without being too obvious. We will definitely be back!

Had a great time. We were a little slow as it was out first and not knowing what to expect, but it has created a desire to do more. Since then we have done two more and now are hooked. Any wait to try their other room. Definitely must do with other friends."
