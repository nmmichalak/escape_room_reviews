The crew that assisted us (Kenny and Meredith) was SUPER AMAZING, FRIENDLY and INFORMATIVE. They ensured the experience was super smooth, easy to understand and was very patient with any and all questions we had. It was definitely a fun and exciting experience. I would definitely recommend this location and would MOST DEFINITELY RETURN. Thanks for the awesome first time experience! My group and I are HOOKED!"

Super friendly staff that actually talk to you and make you feel welcome, and look like they love to be there! The room was amazing! We played The Heist and it was sooo complicated but SO MUCH FUN! A great way to exercise your brain and team build and bond with your group! I felt like I was in a movie with all of the clues and mysteries! It was my boyfriend's birthday, and we did successfully escape, so they gave him a t-shirt and a personalized card that all of the staff members wrote on! This is a really far drive for us, but we have recommended it to all of our friends and will be coming back again and again until we finish all of the rooms! Also, great fun for most age groups!"

All the staff were super friendly. We did The Heist and the room was really nice and fun! We were able to escape the help of our guide. His tips were very helpful and he even threw in a few extras when he saw we were struggling. I've heard good things about the other rooms as well. Can't wait to come back here again! :)

Was pretty challenging  and well thought out. Any room at any of their locations is great! We did it as a family and it was cool to see how each family member saw things. We managed to escape in just under a minute! Would totally reccomend this room.
