"Escape room ""The Underground Morgue"" by Demented Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/demented-escape-room-biohazard,17,Went in a group of four and really enjoyed it. Two of us did an escape room before and two were first timers. All four of us totally loved it! The time flew by as we searched for clues and solved puzzles. We made it out with seconds to spare. The management is awesome - really nice and helpful guy. Definitely recommend checking this escape room out!
"Escape room ""The Underground Morgue"" by Demented Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/demented-escape-room-biohazard,18,"As an avid escape room fan, I truly enjoyed this experience. My husband and I were teamed up with mom and her adult sons, all of whom were in it to win it...and we did! I am more well-versed in escape rooms that feature puzzles to solve the room and this one relied more on finding codes and keys. The facilities were not as 'polished' as some of the other escape rooms I've been to, but still a bunch of fun! I could tell they might still be working out the kinks and hope to see this venue so well. The team running the room seemed really passionate about it and would like to visit again once they change up the theme!"

I wasn't expecting for it to be the way it did. Definitely deserves a 5 star! We barely made it out, laughed the entire time! I know it has a lot to do with who you go with but the ideas were awesome! They're changing in a couple of months and we're definitely coming back. I recommend it ! 100%."
