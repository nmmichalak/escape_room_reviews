"Escape room ""Hacker: Corruption Disruption"" by Lincoln Escape Room in Lincoln",https://worldofescapes.com/lincoln/quests/lincoln-escape-room-hacker,0,"Not only was the room ""Hacker"" absolutely amazing, it was a definite challenge! We've done quite a few around the US and 'Hacker' was definitely the most challenging due to it's nature. It's not a 'guess and check' room, which is a nice change!"
"Escape room ""Hacker: Corruption Disruption"" by Lincoln Escape Room in Lincoln",https://worldofescapes.com/lincoln/quests/lincoln-escape-room-hacker,1,"I went in the room with the lowest success rate, the Hacker, and it was so much fun! It put my team of 7 to work. We had so much fun trying to warp our minds around the little clues. Definitely is a good team bonding activity. 10/10 experience."
