"Escape room ""Masquerade Manor"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-masquerade-manor,2,"This is the BEST escape room I have gone to. The rooms were very detailed, high tech, clean, and very thought out. The hints do not cost you time and are very clear without giving away what to do. The game masters were very present and considerate, we never waited very long for a response. My group was small so we were paired with another couple. They ensured that things would be fair and made sure we knew one person from their group (2 people) had to agree to a hint before they gave one. They were very welcoming from start to finish, they don't rush you at any point. I highly recommend visiting them! They have 2 locations. You will not regret it! P.S. photos are of their waiting room with puzzles and some awesome seating. They have intricate brass chandeliers too that are very pretty."
