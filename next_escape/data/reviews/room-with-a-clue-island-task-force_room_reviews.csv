"Escape room ""Murder at Pier 38"" by Room With a Clue in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/room-with-a-clue-island-task-force,0,We did the Island Task Force. The room was very creative and had a lot of puzzles. We escaped with a little over 3 minutes left. Both rooms are highly recommended. What was awesome was the Island Task Force room is the hardest room outta all their rooms. Thank u so much to Room with a Clue for having helpful and friendly staff members like Tracy and Jeff who provided excellent service. Highly recommended to go.

We came for a work team building event. We did Island Task Force which was great, but we didn't make it out. It was really well organized and the room had plenty of difficult challenges. I have done a few other breakout rooms in Honolulu, and this one is just as good if not better. I can't wait to go back and try again next time!"

Action packed games with many clever puzzles. You really need to use your brain and work together to figure our what everything means. I like how a lot of the puzzles thought outside the box and were not super obvious. There are a lot of puzzles and locks in the game, but it is just the right amount to challenge you."
