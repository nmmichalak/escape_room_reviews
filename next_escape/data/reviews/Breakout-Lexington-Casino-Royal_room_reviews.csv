"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/Breakout-Lexington-Casino-Royal,0,"We came to Breakout Games after the races one night in October. They offer interactive ""escape rooms"" where you and a group of up to 8 have one hour to work through a series of clues and puzzles to solve the storyline of the room. We did the Casino themed room. It was quite difficult, but we solved what felt like about 20 to 25 steps to get out in about 58 minutes.  It was hard to count exactly how many tasks we had to accomplish, and it took a few clues provided by the Game Master moderator who watches you on security camera from another room and gives you hints over a speaker when you ask.  It was actually really fun. Unique idea for friend groups/families.  Will visit again I'm sure."

We found most of the clues & figured out a good portion of the Casino Royale game. We will definitely be back & try our luck at the different rooms!"

On my most recent visit my sisters boyfriend proposed to her in the room. The staff helped him plan this and was openly communicating with him over the course of a month. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for something to do with friends, family or coworkers. Great staff, great rooms and great atmosphere. It's a nice facility and it's kept very clean!"
