"Escape room ""September 1777"" by Escape On Queen in Lancaster",https://worldofescapes.com/lancaster/quests/escape-on-queen-september-1777,0,"We chose September 1777 as our first Escape Room experience and as the celebration of our summer birthdays. It was the perfect scenario for July 4th weekend. The room embeds you in history with modern and classic puzzles. It was fun to work together and be challenged. Great staff, fun experience, good wholesome fun, wonderful venue."
