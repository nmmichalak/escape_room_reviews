Today was the Nuclear Meltdown Room at Baffled. We did not get out alive. But still had tons of fun. Thanks Baffled, we want to try your da vinci room next."

We did nuclear meltdown and got out with 4 minutes 27 seconds to spare! Had a great time and the staff was friendly and made it enjoyable. The kids did feally good and want to go agon. We also did groupon to save money. My only complaint was it was kinda warm in there. A little A/C wouldn't hurt."

We did the nuclear room. It took us nearly the full hour, but we saved the world. So, you're welcome. The staff was very engaging and helpful for the clues we needed. I believe the man's name was vince and he was awesome. The room was well put together. Everything worked as it was supposed to work. Their hours are great. We went to the last time slot - and that worked perfectly.Thank you! We will absolutely be back!"

The room still had a direction, however, so it was fairly easy to stay on track.The staff was present over intercom throughout the experience and provided advice when necessary.This was an engaging team-building experience that I would highly recommend."
