The owners are top notch as well as their games are. Very friendly, welcoming, and over all want the best experience for their customers as they can do. Worth every cent of a full priced game as an escape room can get."
"Escape room ""Spoopy's Ghoulish Graveyard Gameshow"" by Doldrick's Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/doldricks-escape-room-spoopys-ghoulish-graveyard-gameshow,2,"We played both Captn Spoopy Bones and the Graveyard Gameshow games.When we travel we hit escape rooms all around the country. These rooms came highly rated for fun and puzzles and did not disappoint at all. But what took them to an even higher level was the staff who did their best to let us play as long as it took to finish (we were a team of 2 and that was a bit light for the Capn). Even late, late at night after a day of amusement parks, they made sure we had a great time.If you are going to Orlando, Doldrick's should not be missed - so much pirate fun!"
