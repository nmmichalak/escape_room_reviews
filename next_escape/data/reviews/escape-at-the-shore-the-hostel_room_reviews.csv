Had a blast, cannot wait to go back and try the other rooms! We escaped the room with 53 seconds to spare. Loved it and got to ride in the coffin!"

We did the The Hostel (4 of us) and got out with about 7 minutes to spare. This room is really well put together, it's small, but that's part of its fun, the clues are solid, all of the mechanics in the room work well, and the staff is super nice! Love the horror theme dynamic. Would definitely recommend to others!"

So many twists and puzzles to figure out. But we managed to finish The Hostel room with 1:15 minutes to spare. The staff was amazing!! So friendly and helpful! We truly loved every minute of it. We will be back again to conquer the other rooms!!

I picked Hostel because we thought the description was great. This room is small and only fits 4 people. But it's big in details! It was just the two of us, but we totally didn't mind! Made it a little more scarier! My heart was pounding the whole time! So many clues and puzzles. Challenging and rewarding!"
