"Escape room ""Dr. Ensaine"" by Key and Code Escape Rooms in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/key-and-code-escape-rooms-dr-ensaine,3,We went to do the Dr. Ensaine room and it was the first time in an escape room for some of us. We were celebrating my daughter Alora's 13th birthday with her 5 friends. Megan was our clue giver. She was so patient with us. The room was awesome. The girls screamed so much that it was scaring other customers and was entertaining the staff. We finished the room with 3 seconds to spare! Can't wait to do another room!

It’s family owned and operated and the owners are wonderful people. The rooms are so realistic, the puzzles are difficult but not impossible and the intensity is real. Highly recommend Dr. Ensaine, the scare factor is heart bounding and the room-scene-environment is sooo well done!"
