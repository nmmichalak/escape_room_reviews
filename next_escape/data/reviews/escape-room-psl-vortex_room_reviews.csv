"Escape room ""Vortex"" by Escape Room PSL in Port St. Lucie",https://worldofescapes.com/port-st-lucie/quests/escape-room-psl-vortex,0,"Everything was soo convenient, walked over with out 1st group on ""The Vortex "", it was soo much fun. We had a group of 7, but more brains work better than one and in this case we did amazing. Great support and team effort. Helped rely on one another for ideas, clues, figuring things out. Our 2nd group did ""Simon's Room"" and they were ecstatic, loved every minute and was soo much fun. It helps with remembering context clues. Definitely reccomend will not disappoint."

The puzzles were lots of fun. This was definitely one of the better escape rooms we've done. We will return to try another.
