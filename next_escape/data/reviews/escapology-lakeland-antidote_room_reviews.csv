My boyfriend and I had gone to an escape room a year prior to this and we did not have fun. The room was very difficult and not put together well at all. We decided that we would try to go to another escape room and we found Escapology! We did the ""Antidote"" room and it was incredible! We felt like we were actually trying to find an antidote! The room was realistic and fun. It was set up so well! We're going to go again tomorrow :)"

We escaped and had a great time doing it. The decor and theming is wonderfully immersive. I highly recommend Escapology."
