"Escape room ""Wizard Trials"" by PanIQ Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/paniq-room-wizard-trials,0,There were 3 adults and 3 minors in our group. It was super fun. 60 minutes went by super quick. Originally we thought there was only one room and we spent over 40 minutes in just that one room.There was a total of 3 rooms. We used the hint button 3 times. I highly recommend trying this out. The sole employee there was nice.
