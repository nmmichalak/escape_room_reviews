It was challenging but kept you really engaged and had a few surprises. Loved it!"
"Escape room ""MacGregor Manor"" by Game On Escapes & More in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/game-on-escapes-macgregor-manor,4,The MacGregor's Manor was awesome. It was for some reason surprisingly scary. It's up there for one of the most scary escape rooms we've done(We don't do scary rooms often). It was well themed and all the puzzles made sense for what it was used for. Ish had a bunch of fun being our game master. It was a good marry of physical puzzles and electronic puzzles. It was a challenge with everything going on but we got out safe and sound from the manor.
