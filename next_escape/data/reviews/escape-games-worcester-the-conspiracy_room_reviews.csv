Nick was our guide and he could not have been better, his enthusiasm really added to the experience! We will be back, maybe this time we will escape our room!"

Didn't know what to expect but it was so much fun! Very clever puzzles to solve and figure out. The kids were excited to be able to take credit for solving some of the clues. We had to use all our support cues but got out with 2 minutes to spare! Definitely do it again. Great room, great set up and great staff!"
