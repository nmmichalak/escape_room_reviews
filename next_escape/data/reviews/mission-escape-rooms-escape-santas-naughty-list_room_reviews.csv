"Escape room "" The Alchemist’s Lab"" by Mission Escape Rooms in Annapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/annapolis/quests/mission-escape-rooms-escape-santas-naughty-list,0,This place is awesome! I did the Santa’s helpers room with three other people. It was a great time! The rooms are challenging but a great way to work together. Employees are great and they even help you when you need it! The room themes are interesting and I can’t wait to try them all! Recommend to anyone!
