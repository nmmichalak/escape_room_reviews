Incredibly friendly game masters. My family has been to several escape rooms and this was the first that offered different difficulty levels. We thought we were hot shots and went for ""medium"" difficulty. We died of course . Highly recommend!"

There were ten of us completing it on hard and we didn't survive, but we all had a blast. The theme of the room was great and well organized. Good layout, realistic props, etc. It was a good combination of trying to solve puzzles, find clues, and figure out the next step. Challenging but not frustrating! Good luck escaping!"
