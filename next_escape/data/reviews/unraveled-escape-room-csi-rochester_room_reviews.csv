"Escape room ""CSI: Rochester"" by UNRAVELED Escape Room in Rochester (MN)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester-mn/quests/unraveled-escape-room-csi-rochester,0,Our group of friends did the CSI: Rochester room and had a blast! It was tastefully done and respectfully difficult. Jackie and Ryan are fantastic people and took wonderful care of us. They really do have a passion for it and care about what they are doing with their escape rooms. It shows as well in the way they run it and the personal touches they add to the experience. Cannot wait to do the other rooms as well!

We did the Escape from Alcatraz last year, and the CSI: Rochester today. Both times my family and I had a heck of a lotta fun! The puzzles are challenging without being impossible, and you can even choose your own difficulty level before you start. Awesome time, and we will be back again!"
