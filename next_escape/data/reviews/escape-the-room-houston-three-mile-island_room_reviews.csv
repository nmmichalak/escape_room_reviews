"Escape room ""Meltdown"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-the-room-houston-three-mile-island,1,That was a lot of fun! I went here with my work colleagues and we competed to complete rooms. It was challenging and enjoyable at the same time. Great experience and I think I will bring my family back to either this location or the one in the Woodlands.
