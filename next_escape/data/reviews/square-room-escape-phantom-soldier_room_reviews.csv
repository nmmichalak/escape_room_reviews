I'm not someone who typically enjoys puzzles, riddles, games, etc., but Square Room Escape has really elevated the experience for me. This is an excellent alternative for when you're looking for something to do and want a different option than going to the movies/bowling/karaoke. The clues are never the same, the rooms are beautifully decorated, and the whole thing from start to finish is very immersive. Definitely go check it out!"
