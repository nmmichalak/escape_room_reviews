"Escape room ""Meltdown"" by Escape Virtuality in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-virtuality-meltdown,0,Unbelievable experience! Highly recommend. Super friendly staff.
"Escape room ""Meltdown"" by Escape Virtuality in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-virtuality-meltdown,1,I bought a Groupon for this place for the virtuality games and it was very fun. Michael was very helpful and entertaining. My three friends and I spent an hour here. The only thing that I did not like is that the workers have to set the games up for you and that takes more time from your actual games. I recommend.
