"Escape room ""The A.I."" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-ai,0,The room itself has great reviews! The customer service is absolutely horrible and so far the worst I have run into at any escape room by far. Definitely will not be returning and really encourage people to go elsewhere. The experience overall was not nearly as good because of the people we had to deal with.

The interactions with both the room and the computer interface went seamlessly together. The challenges were well organized and the mechanics varied significantly so that you were kept on your toes the whole time. If you complete the room with at least 15 minutes to spare, an additional challenge is activated, so that added a whole extra level of fun!"

We did the AI Room, very high tech and unique puzzles that I won't spoil, but trust me, I haven't seen anything like it before. Awesome staff that are enthusiastic about the game, we had an amazing time. Looking forward to trying The Lab!"

Their rooms are unlike any other escape games I've played. The AI room has a talking robot. How cool is that?! Do listen to the robot, it actually responds to your actions in the room. The decoration is also top notch. My group definitely will be coming back for their other rooms. I heard the next room is coming out in about a month."
"Escape room ""The A.I."" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-ai,4,"Just finished AI room with 8 people. It was definitely a room that utilized the most technology out of the escape rooms I have done, which added to the experience. The room was committed to the theme throughout. I was more used to the flip-everything-in-the-room type of escape rooms, so it was definitely a nice change.The staff was extremely patient, friendly, and knowledgeable! So excited for the other rooms to be finished!"

I was literally about to pee my pants because I was so excited!Our group of 7 came on a Friday night, we had all done escape rooms before except for 1. Our game master was very friendly. We watched the introduction video and began our mission. It was an extremely high tech room! It was definitely difficult but you will have to work with your team and communicate."
