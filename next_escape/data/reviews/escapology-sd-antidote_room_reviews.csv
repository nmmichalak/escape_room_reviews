"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology San Diego in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapology-sd-antidote,0,"Did Antidote today and had a great time, we had Oscar as our host and he was very friendly. We also got to meet Josh who was our game master. He knew exactly when to send us a hint when we needed it. Would highly recommend. Will be back to do the other two rooms."

We did the ""easy"" Antidote room and barely made it out with 5 minutes but we had to ask for help a lot! Great game masters and fun experience! Will definately be back!"
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology San Diego in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapology-sd-antidote,2,This was my first escape room and it was awesome. We made it in and out in 21 minutes and only used the free clues. I'll admit it was a little challenging with all the clues spread out between the rooms but it was worth the brain power. I hope I can come back again and try the other ones.

First time trying an escape room and we will be back. Facility was easy to get to, made us use our brains and work together. Glad we picked one that doesn't rely on scary stuff to make it challenging. Thank you Escapology for a fun team building activity."
