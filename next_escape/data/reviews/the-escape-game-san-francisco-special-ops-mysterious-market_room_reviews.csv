"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-special-ops-mysterious-market,1,Had a blast doing the special ops room! It’s an 8/10 difficulty but the staff are very helpful with giving you the clues. Beat the room with three minutes to spare! I would definitely do another room next time I’m in the area. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for something fun and challenging to do!

It was my first time going to an escape room and I would definitely try it again. My friends and I were in the Special Ops: Mystery Market room and we spent the whole time laughing. We mentioned to our host that we were there to celebrate our friends birthday and at the end of the game she gave my friend a birthday card that was signed by the employees. It was such a nice and unexpected gesture. I would totally go back again!

We did the Special Ops room which has a terrific decor and feel. The clues are very ingenious, going beyond your typical puzzles and interconnected clues. Not that those are not present but there is definitely more. An overall fun immersive way to spend 60 minutes, or less if you escape."
