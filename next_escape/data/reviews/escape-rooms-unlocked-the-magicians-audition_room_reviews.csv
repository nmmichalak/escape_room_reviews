"Escape room ""The Magician’s Audition"" by Escape Rooms Unlocked in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-rooms-unlocked-the-magicians-audition,0,"This was our second visit. The first time my son (17), his friend (16) and I experienced the Magician's room. We had a great time! Today my son brought his girlfriend and we were successful again but with 0 seconds left on the clock! It was down to the wire! Special thanks to the owners! They were polite, helpful and very personable and professional! I highly recommend this place for older kids and adults alike! Thank you!"

What a great time! Everyone enjoyed themselves. The room was well thought out and very clever! The establishment was very clean and sleek. Staff is superb! We made it out with almost 12 minutes to spare!
