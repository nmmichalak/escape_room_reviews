"Escape room ""Empress of the Globe"" by Live Game Escape in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/live-game-escape-white-empress,4,"This is my first time playing a live game escape and had a great experience with my friends. I always play those games online and it's so addicting. We had the Empress of the Globe and the room is very nice decorated. Our group had a lot of fun solving the puzzles and unlocking the locks. It started off with a story plot, and we're locked into a room with a limited time of 45mins to complete. The staff willing to give you hint if you're stuck at some parts. This is a fun game with friends required everyone to participate to solve the puzzle. Overall, my experience is great and they're going to have a new Halloween theme room which I am looking forward to!"

We had an amazing time! The puzzles were challenging and we had the opportunity to work together as a group to figure out how to find our way out!It was so much fun!The only drawback is that, in my opinion, is that I didn't really feel the tension of ""working against the clock"". We didn't even realize we had run out of time to solve the puzzle and continued to work on our clues. All in all we had an excellent time and even bought another visit for a different game before we left.Check Living Social for deals!"

It took a lot of team effort to solve the puzzles and find the next hints, which made it such a fun night out with friends. The props in the room were awesome. The worker was very nice and helpful too. My friends and I wanted to do another room right after!"
