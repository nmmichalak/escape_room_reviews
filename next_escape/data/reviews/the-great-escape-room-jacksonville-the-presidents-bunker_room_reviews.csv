"Escape room ""The President's Bunker"" by The Great Escape Room in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-great-escape-room-jacksonville-the-presidents-bunker,0,"Chris was awesome. We went for two rooms making the Bunker but not passing the Library. We had 4 adults with two kids ages 6 and 2. This place deserves its 5 star rating including the kids and making them feel part of it (thank you Chris (Blue)). We will definitely be back to they our luck with the other two rooms. I have been to double digit escape rooms and feel these to rank with the best, not too easy and not impossible. Well done ""The Great Escape Room!"""
"Escape room ""The President's Bunker"" by The Great Escape Room in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-great-escape-room-jacksonville-the-presidents-bunker,1,"I booked this as a work group team building event and it was perfect.  Easy to book online and they quickly responded via email to any questions I had regarding the process.  Location is convenient and there is plenty of parking.  You get there about 15 minutes early for them to explain the game and what will happen.  We did the president's bunker and it was both challenging and fun.  Don't want to spoil anything so won't give details on what we did, but I will say that you have to work together to get it done (proud to say we finished in about 56 minutes).  The guide (his name was Blue) was awesome, supportive but added some more twists to the game.  Pictures at the end with fun props.  All around great experience and highly recommend.  Tip: we did an early afternoon and did not have to book the whole room, but I'm not sure if that is the way the night time ones are.  We had the joint to ourselves so that was cool too.  Thanks!"
