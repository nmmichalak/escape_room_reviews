It wasn't easy, in fact it was downright challenging, but so much fun! We couldn't stop talking about it afterwards at dinner! Thank you Gamekeeper Zack and the rest of the staff for making our experience so worth it!"

Only two of us in the room but we managed to complete it with seconds to spare. This is a great brain game that keeps you thinking throughout the entire game. If youâ€™ve ever had doubts about going, stop it and just GO. We will be returning for sure."
