"Escape room ""Zombie Escape"" by Castle of Chaos in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/chaos-escape-rooms-zombie-escape,0,I did the new zombie outbreak escape room and it was terrific. The puzzles were just hard enough to keep our gears turning until we ran out of time (so close!!). Great decor and the staff was very friendly. Check 'em out.

Very intense and a new take on escape rooms. I liked that you could also interact with the actor and the clues were helpful. I would definitely try another escape room with them."
