"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,0,"Terrific multifaceted puzzle experience that brought out the best of our multi talented and multi generational crew. The experience was very challenging, but we made it before time ran out and had a very fun and satisfying experience that will have us trying another room as soon as it’s ready. Thanks to Jeff and his family for creating such an ingenious and fun experience! "
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,1,"ABSOLUTELY one of the best date nights we've ever had!! Jeff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great time. I had originally booked this event believing the room would fill up. Supposedly, it is best when played with a group of at least 6 people. Jeff promptly called me the day of to make sure I still wanted to play the game. I told him I wasn't sure since it might be overwhelming for just 2 people to figure out and by 3pm my boyfriend was having a terrible day at work and because of it we'd have to miss dinner in order to make the start time. Jeff quickly brought my spirits up and encouraged me to do it or he offered to move me to another date (at no extra charge). He was willing to wait a bit for us to grab a snack and even had some cheesecake waiting for us at the end of the game. Besides having a great time, we learned we're a phenomenal team as we escaped the room in exactly 1 hour. It's challenging, it's fun and a definite must, even if your group just ends up being a dynamic duo. Thank you Jeff!!!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,2,"It was a blast! Jeff is the man! He gave us extra time because we were a small group and we're taking a little long to figure out the clues. And the escape room itself was awesome. The riddles and figuring everything out was a lot harder than you would expect. It definitely works all parts of your brain! It's something new, different, and fun for any day of the week. I definitely recommend this and will do it again!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,3,"We had so much fun as room escapers! We were a smaller private group of 5 people, but we managed to make it out with time to spare! The puzzles were challenging, but everyone was able to contribute and have fun solving them. We would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about going. And Jeff is the best!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,4,"We had a blast! Our group finished with 18 seconds to spare. We had 4 ppl and another couple we didn't know for a total of 6. The more people the better! Jeff did a fantastic job making the puzzles challenging but doable! Make sure to read your confirmation email, it is very helpful. We didn't, and ended up going to the wrong place and missing our experience the first time. This was so much fun, if you are still debating about doing it or not. Stop, and buy some tickets. Totally worth it!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,5,"Just escaped tonight with 2 minutes to spare. We had a blast!!! My husband organized a private group of 10 for my birthday and it was soooooo much fun. You can tell Jeff really takes a lot of pride in Room Escapers and put a lot of effort to come up with all the clues. It takes a lot of thought but it is totally doable. Especially since Jeff will help you along the way. But he doesn't help you too much. As an added bonus.... My sister had called (knowing we were doing Room Escapers tonight) because she wanted to send me a surprise me for my bday. She worked with Jeff who actually went out to Modern Pastry to get us a variety of pastries to reward us for escaping!! If that is not personal service, I don't know what is!!!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,6,"I didn't have high expectations going in, since this isn't my typical go-to for a fun night, but I had a grand ole time. It was unlike any game I'd played before, which was really exciting. I went with a couple of friends while I was in town, and I have to say this is a definite must-do for groups of all ages. I live in Atlanta and had such a great experience, I plan on finding a similar venue here to take my team out for a work outing. Definitely would recommend going!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,7,"I wasn't sure what to accept when a group of friends and I headed to RoomEscapers last night , but it sounded fun, so decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad we did! We had a great time, and it is something fun and different to do. Your group has an hour to work together to solve riddles and puzzles to advance into the next room, then eventually ""escape"". The clues were well thought out and challenging, but not too hard that it becomes frustrating.The business owner, Jeff, is friendly and helpful. It's in a great location near the T, and Parcel 7 garage, which they validate for. I'd recommend this for all ages, and for locals and tourists. Great place!"
"Escape room ""The Pirate’s Booty II: The Lost Ship"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/pirates-booty,8,We had a group of 4 ppl and had blast!  Jeff was great!  This was our first time doing something like this and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  I can't wait to do another one!  We escaped the room with less than a minute to spare.
