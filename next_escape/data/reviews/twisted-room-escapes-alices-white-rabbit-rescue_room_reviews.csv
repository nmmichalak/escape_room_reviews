"Escape room ""Alice's White Rabbit Rescue"" by Twisted Room Escapes in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/twisted-room-escapes-alices-white-rabbit-rescue,0,"Their escape rooms are very professional and creative. My family has completed every escape room they currently have to offer, including their most recent Alice's White Rabbit rescue, (which was very bright, cute, and wonderfully elaborate.) and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. The hidden poker chip = prize wheel spin is a unique and exciting addition to escape rooms (and an easy way to get some of their merchandise to spread the word!) We can't wait for them to open their next room."
