"Escape room ""Like a Surgeon"" by Make a Break Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/make-a-break-escape-like-a-surgeon,2,"We did the Like A Surgeon room. It was challenging! We almost did not make it out, and two of us are in the medical field! This was my first experience with an escape room and I would return and try others.The business is clean and well put together. They try to keep it fun, by hinting when you are stuck. I feel the price per person is a little high though. If you have a family of four at $28 each, it is expensive entertainment for only one hour!"
