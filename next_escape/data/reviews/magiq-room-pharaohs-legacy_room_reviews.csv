"Escape room ""The Curse of the Mummy"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-pharaohs-legacy,0,"Having fun and adventure in one place, Magiq room is what you need. I celebrated my birthday in here and I had so much fun. It was not just an ordinary birthday celebration but also a fun filled adventure time. We tried one of the escape rooms and my friends and I had so much fun escaping out of the room before the time is out. The clues and solving the puzzles made us closer to each other and the team work has unleashed in us. I recommend this place for a great Team Building place, surely your workmates and you will have a great time in here."
"Escape room ""The Curse of the Mummy"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-pharaohs-legacy,1,"Finally played Pharoah's Legacy! It's now one of my top 10 favorite rooms! (This was my 73rd room) Even though this place is great for kids and families, both times I've gone has been with adults and we've had a blast.The quality and production value in these rooms are amazing. Especially this room. This is the second pharaoh-themed room I've played and it's beautiful inside. The puzzles are fun and logical. There are physical puzzles and a passageway. I highly recommend this room for anyone. Beginners will have a great time and enthusiasts will enjoy what you get to do in this room.Our Gamemaster, Sophie, was amazing as well! Book them today!"
