"Escape room ""Pharaohâ€™s Revenge"" by Escape Room Alexandria in Alexandria (MN)",https://worldofescapes.com/alexandria-mn/quests/escape-room-alexandria-mn-pharaohs-revenge,0,"There were 6 of us who did Pharaoh's Revenge. It was definitely a challenge to get done in the hour time frame, but we did it! Tons of clever puzzles, and clues to solve. You really have to divide and conquer to get it all solved in time. Our family really enjoyed it. It was the first time for about half of us. Great way for a group to spend an hour in Alexandria!"
