"Escape room ""Space Bus"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-space-bus,0,"Booked Space Bus after playing the King Arthur game and it was worth it. To start with it is a GORGEOUS game. I played a few sci-fi themed escape games around the world and this one is the best one yet. The deep rumble of engines and a little bit of movement made it so real! The game puzzles are well done and games allow for many things to be done at the same time. Also, some puzzles could be solved in more than one way. Be sure not to overcomplicate, because in many cases the solution is simpler than you think. "

The staff we interacted with were very friendly. The condition of the bus was excellent, quite new. The level of technology in the bus in regard to the puzzles was also unexpected. I thought the experience would comprise of shaking curtains for hidden keys or looking under loose tile and the like, haha. To finish the bus on time with the amount of puzzles, you should definitely have at least 4 participants.My 5 friends and I did not set any records but we finished with exactly 1 minute to spare! Oh, the drama!"

But won't be my last.Came to celebrate my brother in law's birthday, so just finished dinner at Osso up the street and met the rest of our party (18 total) here.  The staff quickly separated the large group into 3 teams and set us on our way.  Preliminary instructions were quick, to the point, and off we were.  I was blessed with the Space Bus, a super detailed designed ""school bus"" outside of the facility.  At first I looked at he exterior and thought ""huh"", but once inside and locked it, the lights, sounds, and feeling of immersion was immediate.  And damn we're the puzzles cool and challenging.  No spoilers here, except we got maybe 4 hints, and finished the experience with 3 minutes to spare.  CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER ROOM!  Definitely will be back.  Great job!"

Great time with team of 7 (4 adults and 3 teenagers).  Although we finished with plenty of time, not knowing how close we were (or not) made it a ton of fun.  Our guide Will was fantastic and actually recommended some escape rooms in Los Angeles (where we went next).Actual tips:  Listen during the guide's introduction -- it'll be important.  Read everything (even more important).  Assign the math-y puzzles to the Kumon lovers on your team."
