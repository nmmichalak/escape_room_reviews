"Escape room ""The Dark Sector"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-the-dark-sector,1,Visited the North Valley Escape Room with our out of town guests. We had an amazing time! It was so much fun for all. We have done other escape rooms across the Valley and this is by far the best!
"Escape room ""The Dark Sector"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-the-dark-sector,2,This was the first time we had ever done this and it was so much fun. Somebody had told us this one was the best in the area and we were glad she did. A great experience. My only criticism was that we were told all the clues we had missed and if they hadn't told us we would probably do the same one again. A missed opportunity for more business.
