"Escape room ""Game of Swords"" by Planet Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/planet-escape-room-game-of-swords,0,My dad gifted my family the Game of Swords escape room for Christmas.  It was a lot of fun!  Challenging enough for the five of us to work together and manage to get through the entire thing.  Hunter was very enthusiastic and a great game master.  He made the next few rooms that will be opening soon sound really fun so we might have to be back!

Once to their mob room and once to the game of swords. We really enjoyed it both times. The staff is super attentive, offering just the right amount of help at just the right times for you to feel successful and still be challenged. We can't wait for them to open more rooms so we can return."
