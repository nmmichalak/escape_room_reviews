"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/escapology-montgomery-cuban-crisis,0,"I enjoyed this place a lot. Soon as we walked in the art and different crafts caught your attention, for some reason it reminded me of a tattoo parlor, haha. But we came for a birthday party and we had a good-sized group, my group chose the Cuban Crisis as our mission. You basically have 60 mins to find clues and crack the codes to finally receive the code to unlock the door. Just know we cracked our code with 9 mins left to spare and we beat the other team by 3 mins.I know we all enjoyed our experience as it was everyone's first time there. I know I enjoyed mine."
