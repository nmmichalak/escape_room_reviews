"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by Escape Room Novi in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-novi-the-speakeasy,0,We did the new Speakeasy room last weekend and had a blast. We didn't solve the puzzle in time but we had a lot of fun. There were four of us and this was our first time doing an escape room which probably explains why we didn't get out. The puzzles weren't linear so we could work on a few different ones at the same time. The staff was courteous and was obviously monitoring our progress so they could give us relevant clues when we finally asked for them. Bring more people!
