"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Burnsville in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escapology-burnsville-budapest-express,0,"We did the Budapest Express with three college kids--so much fun for all of us! We beat it with time to spare. Game Master Will was paying great attention to us. When it came time for clues, he just called our attention to what we already knew and gave us a little nudge in the right direction. Loved that all the experiences are private rather than being mixed with other groups. Worth a few extra $$. "

The staff was very nice and the rooms were clean and very fun. Would try other rooms that they offer in the future.

We had three couples, all novices, trying to solve the mystery. While we did not escape in time, we did solve the mystery for the most part. We had a wonderful time onboard the Budapest Express and would recommend this to anyone, especially those more experienced in escape rooms."
