The ambience, detail, and engrossing puzzles definitely kept our group on our feet the entire time. 5 Stars! A masterful job well done. Will definitely be back for more!"

Then, a secret door opens, and I was blown away. There were secret passageways, other doors, it was huge, and we beat it with two minutes to spare and I couldn't believe how complex it was. I am already planning a trip back with friends, and let me tell you, after that experience, everyone involved couldn't stop talking about it, and I guarantee we will talk about it later as well. I personally called two friends and told them my whole experience."

The puzzles were new and different and the interaction between the puzzles and the space were terrific. The puzzles themselves were not too hard (ensuring that complex math or problem solving would not be the reason that you cannot escape) but we're connected throughout the room. Take it from an experienced escapee ... visit this place!"

I went with a group of friends that never done one either. We tried Whispering Halls and it was Fantastic! We were definitely engrossed in all the puzzles and surprises. We did not escape on time but was on the last puzzle when we ran out of time. Nevertheless we loved the experience. The staff was awesome. The clues, puzzles, decorations, ambiance, etc was great. We couldn't stop talking about how much fun it was and when we want to go back and try the other experience!"
