"Escape room ""Cold War Crisis"" by American Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/american-escape-rooms-tampa-cold-war-crisis,0,"My friends surprised me with an escape room for my birthday and this place was a great choice for this. Because they mentioned that it was my birthday, the game master included an extra clue in our room as a birthday present to me. We did the Cold War Crisis. Fantastic room and with great clues. It definitely tested us well. We got out with about four minutes to spare and at times we were definitely concerned that we weren't going to make it out. The timer that they have in the room also includes a counter at the bottom that helps you track how many clues you get and the standard amount of clues that you get is 5. This room was rated 5/5 for difficulty which I think is aptly earned. Our game master Alexa was great. Super friendly and helpful before and after the room. Overall, great experience and I would definitely go back again."

Too bad we failed to defuse the bomb and destroyed the US. I guess we were not the men for the job but weâ€™ll try again!"
