"Escape room ""Cabin of the Jersey Devil"" by Exit 4 Private Escape Rooms in Glassboro",https://worldofescapes.com/glassboro/quests/escape-room-south-jersey-cabin-of-the-jersey-devil,0,"This was the first ever escape room I’ve ever done. Since then, I’ve been obsessed with what kind of other escape rooms there is all around New Jersey.Anyway, our guide was wonderful. It was difficult in the beginning, but we escapes with 7 minutes to spare. It’s not as scary as the fear level says, but it is dark and does have thunderstorm sound effects throughout the process of escaping. Other than that, it was a very fun experience"
