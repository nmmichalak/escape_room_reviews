"Escape room ""Dr. Botcher's Minute Medical School"" by Two Bit Circus in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/two-bit-circus-dr-botchers-minute-medical-school,1,"We went to celebrate a friends bday. We looked into doing something different and fun and found it. We hit the happy hour deals. They have a variety of drinks that satisfied everyone in our group. The food looked good. Didn't get a chance to try any.We tried a couple of their VR rooms. That was pretty cool. We opt to do the Raft. I believe it was the only one that was offered that night. But we had fun with that. I'm not too much into gaming but it was well worth the experience. We also did the one with the doctor. Now that one was pretty interesting. Since all of our group is involved in the medical field one way or another, it was pretty fun to try and keep the Patient alive. Took a lot of team work and felt like we were in the E.R. trying to keep the dummy alive!!! LOL!The arcade area was fun. Plenty of games to play. From famous arcades to tic tac toe Basketball to skiball. And don't forget to challenge your friends in a game of ice hockey made for 4.They seem to host private parties and have jumbo connect 4 and Jenga. Those are always fun.Will definitely be going back since we still have bits to spend in our cards."
