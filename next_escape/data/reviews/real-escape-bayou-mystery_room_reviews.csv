"Escape room ""Bayou Mystery"" by Real Escape in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/real-escape-bayou-mystery,2,We had a great time at Real Escape! What possibly had the potential of being very disappointing got immediately handled by Eric. He came to the rescue. There was a hiccup with our online reservation. Eric made things happen and we were in! Then the experience itself was ton of fun! THANK YOU Eric and Pauly. You guys were awesome! :)
