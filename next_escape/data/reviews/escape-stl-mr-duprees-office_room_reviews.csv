"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-stl-mr-duprees-office,0,This was so much fun! My 15-year-old daughter and I worked with another family in the Dupree room. It was quite challenging but we had a blast. Our host was great. I would highly recommend this activity.
"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-stl-mr-duprees-office,1,This was a great time. Our work used this as a team building experience. We did Mr. Dupree and failed although with about a minute more we would have figured it out. One phase seemed to stump us and slow us down for a bit. Overall it was a fun experience and would recommend.

We did Mr. Dupree's Office, and our group had a blast. It was fairly difficult, but we all came together and figured it out, with A SECOND TO SPARE! It was exciting, and a fun alternative to the same old birthday party. Well done!"

Brianna was amazing as our host. She explained what we were going to be doing without giving away any secrets of the room, gave us our briefing folders, and we were off! The puzzles and clues were very balanced, they weren't impossible to solve nor were they simple either. It was great to do as a group, ours was 5 people, which seemed to be a good number. I'd definitely recommend Escape STL to my friends and family and I'd love to try they James Bomb room!"
