"Escape room ""Two Thirty Nine"" by Evolution Escape Rooms in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/evolution-escape-rooms-two-thirty-nine,2,"I had an absolute blast doing Two Thirty Nine with my friends!  I liked how it only allowed up to 6 people, so my friends and I were able to fill it without worrying about getting stuck with strangers (hate that).The room had great puzzles with clever clues.  It definitely felt like we were trying to escape and with a sense of urgency.  VERY realistic!  I've done several escape rooms that felt too fake, not this one!They did something I had never done before.  They take you to the room blindfolded!  You start in the main area where they go over the ""rules"" (standard escape room protocol) and then they give you blindfolds to wear.  You then walk in a line with your hand on each other's back to the room (employee leads of course).  Then you are sat down, door is shut, sounds start, and you take your blindfold off and... ESCAPE!  Sounds silly but this made it all the more mysterious and ""real.""Highly recommend.  I loved it!"
