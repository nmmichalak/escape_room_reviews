"Escape room ""Perfect Crime"" by PanIQ Escape Room San Jose in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paniq-escape-room-san-jose-perfect-crime,0,"Awesome escape room! My boyfriend and I checked out ""The Perfect Crime"" and finished with like 20 seconds to spare. It was challenging. You bring in a walkie-talkie to ask for hints when you need It (we took three). There were some really cool elements to the room and some were so difficult I feel like I wouldn't have gotten It without the hints. It would've helped to have more than two people though! Highly recommend these rooms."

We almost solved the crime but we ran out of time... So close! Super fun and nerdy. I would have made a great investigator!

Had a lot of fun poking around, solving puzzles and trying to find combinations. Whenever I put code it felt like the code is wrong, but when it works, it feels so good! Even though prices a bit high for small parties, still worth trying, since they give discounts sometimes."

This time we were 5 of us which I feel was a perfect amount of participants. The puzzles are unique, there were a bunch I've never seen before and the set is terrific! Highly Recommended!"

HUGE LIKE: their rooms are not linear! We went with a group of 6, and all of us were doing something the whole time."
