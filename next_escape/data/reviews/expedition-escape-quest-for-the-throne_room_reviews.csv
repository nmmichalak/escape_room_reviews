We had a group of 8 and did the Quest for the Throne. Our guide, Nick, was so fun and helpful. We can't wait to do another one!"
"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Expedition Escape in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/expedition-escape-quest-for-the-throne,1,"Did the Quest for the Throne today with five other people. We have done many of the rooms offered at their loations and this one was just as fun and very interactive and well planned.Chris made our day by being a great guide, really got us into the experience instead of just reading off a card, he drew us into the role and offered hints only when we were really stuck. In the end we ""reclaimed our birthright"". "
"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Expedition Escape in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/expedition-escape-quest-for-the-throne,2,I did the intermediate room (Quest for the Throne) with my family of five and we did not escape but had so much fun trying to do so. I would recommend the beginner room if you have not done one before. I would go back!
