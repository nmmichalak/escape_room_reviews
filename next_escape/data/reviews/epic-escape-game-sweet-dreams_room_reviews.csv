Peter and the rest of the staff at Epic Escape Game were really wonderful. Polite and professional from start to finish. Some of our players had done escape rooms before (me included) but other ones were first-timers. Peter suggested that we play Sweet Dreams (only moderately difficult) since not everyone was familiar with the process. I was worried that it would be too easy for those of us who weren't new to escape rooms, but it was great - plenty challenging and super fun. Will definitely be coming back here!"
