"Escape room ""The Sanatorium"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-sanatorium,0,A group of us from work did their escape the room spin-off called I survived the room and it was amazing!! I did the regular one in Manhattan but this was about the same price but much longer because of the added theatrics. We did the sanatorium and the actors were superb. Only complaint is that We wanted to tip afterwards but didn't know where out exactly how. Props to this group for taking escape the room to the next level!(Note I initially did this review for lic indoor extreme sports where this is hosted before they created a different page for this. I was asked by then to post here too which I an happy to)
"Escape room ""The Sanatorium"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-sanatorium,1,I went with a group of 6 for a friend's birthday and did the sanatorium one. It was my first escape the room experience but it was amazing. The rooms were very well designed and the doctor was an amazing actor. We loved it and couldn't stop talking about it on the way home. We will definitely come back to try escape another one!!!

Toured the I Survived the Room ""Sanatorium"" in LIC. The acting was great, The game itself was really fun. Surreal experience overall. Totally Worth it."
"Escape room ""The Sanatorium"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-sanatorium,3,"This is the second Escape Room game that I have participated in, and although the other was fun(Mission Escapes), this by all definition has set a new level of interaction that was more akin to being trapped in a movie.I survived the room offers 2 different escape rooms, we chose The Sanatorium, I don't want to give away to much because that's the point of the game, solving clues.  But what I can tell you is your locked up in two of the creepiest cells and you have to work in unison with the people in the other jail cell to escape, brilliant!The sound, effects, level of detailing and the incredible actors make this an incredible value for every single one of the $25 I spent for my ticket.If your a gamer this is a must..."
"Escape room ""The Sanatorium"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-sanatorium,4,"Having been unsuccessful at a prior escape attempt at a place in the city, I wanted the chance to redeem myself.   Seeing all the stellar Yelp reviews for this place, I decided to book a night as a beer club event.The set up is well organized once you get there.  When I signed up online, I immediately received a receipt but never got any confirmation email.  I tried to call but after being on hold for about 15 minutes and hearing the message ""email is the fastest way to reach us!"" I decided to send an email to confirm my reservation.  Long story short, after sending the email through the page on their website, I never received a response.Once I got there, they confirmed me in the computer and my team and I signed our waivers and were good to go.   This room has interactive actors involved and they were uniformly excellent!  Really good, creepy and a bit scary.   From the first second you begin, you are engaged.  Without giving too much away, my group did the Sanatorium and we were handcuffed and separated into two groups and placed in two cells.  The clues were very hard to fine (or maybe we are not so bright).   We did use clues from the Doctor twice.  Did I mention he was really good?  He was really good.It became clear we missed some things and by the time we got back on track, time was running out so we didn't end up escaping.  Sometimes I felt a little helpless because the cells were small and with four people in them sometimes all I could do was stand in a corner because there wasn't room for all of us to be searching.   A little more space so that everyone can participate would be helpful, or else going with smaller friends!  Also, if you have claustrophobia, the experience of being handcuffed in a confined space may make you uncomfortable.    You definitely will have more fun with friends because the quarters are tight.  Also, some wetnaps in the cells would be great.  Believe me.Overall, I liked this and after a couple of days, my frustration at not escaping has turned to scheming as to who I will convince more people to go back with me.   This is a well done experience."
"Escape room ""The Sanatorium"" by I Survived The Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/i-survived-the-room-sanatorium,5,"I had an out-of-town guest in who was curious to try escape rooms while in town.  We did a couple in Manhattan, but decided that, based on the great reviews here, it was worth it to head out to LIC to try I Survived the Room - and I'm so glad we did!!While the other escape rooms that we did were fun, they didn't have the immersiveness, intensity, or incredible production values (not to mention acting!) that the Sanatorium event did.  While we were ultimately unsuccessful in completing the event, it was still so much fun!  As others have said, it is probably not an ideal activity for claustrophobics (but why would someone with that fear want to be locked in a room in the first place??), but I felt the crowded ""cells"" added an extra layer of challenge, in that one person couldn't see everything in their own cell, let alone the cell of the other group.  The atmosphere is very creepy, and there are a handful of jump scares, but the fear is built into the environment (music, decor, props, etc), not just in people sneaking up on you.  And, as many have said (but it is worth repeating), the actors are amazing!  They clearly know exactly what they are doing and how to manage different groups of people who might have different reactions.  All in all, an absolutely stellar activity!!"
