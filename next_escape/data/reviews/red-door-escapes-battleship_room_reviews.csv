"Escape room ""Battleship"" by Red Door Escapes in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/red-door-escapes-battleship,1,"Awesome experience! We went as a family of four. (Kids age 9 and 11)We did the battleship room, but will definitely be back to do any others! The owner is amazing and was very helpful with clues when we got stuck. My youngest said it was more fun than a video game, so I'll say it was a huge success! Much more affordable than most as well. Thanks for a wonderful evening!"
"Escape room ""Battleship"" by Red Door Escapes in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/red-door-escapes-battleship,2,We did the Battleship room and it was a blast. The entire room is so well put together and the clues are so challenging to figure out! We were so immersed in the escape that it really felt like we were in that situation trying to save Captain Nemo! The owner was so awesome and we will definitely be back for the opening of the next room. Thanks for the experience!
"Escape room ""Battleship"" by Red Door Escapes in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/red-door-escapes-battleship,3,"We did this room with two adults and two kids ages 6 and 9. The room was really well set up and felt like we were in the Captain's quarters on a carrier . It was really well done and everything from the detail in the room to the sound really added to the ambience.The story was cool and drew us in and the puzzles were neat to figure out. The kids had a great time contributing and working the physical pieces while we did the tougher pieces (with some help when we needed it, which was nice :)). It was the perfect level of challenging vs fun to complete.Would do again and looking forward to what Red Door makes in the future!"
