"Escape room ""The 13th Floor"" by The Escape Artist in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/the-escape-artist-the-13th-floor,0,"We were a group of 4 and tried the 13th floor room. It was our first escape room experience and we weren’t sure what to expect. It was challenging, but fun. We were problem solving the whole time. We did ask for hints to help us along. We all enjoyed it and are planning our next one! I wish they just did private parties so you weren’t worried about being paired with strangers."

One of my favorites so far!Great theming and environment, excellent use of tech, logical puzzles with a really good challenge level, everything made sense with the room/ theme/clues/story, good variety of logic styles, awesome friendly staff. We’ll be going back soon for the space room for sure!"
"Escape room ""The 13th Floor"" by The Escape Artist in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/the-escape-artist-the-13th-floor,2,I had a blast. The 13th floor was the theme we chose. Very challenging but super fun. Two of us escaped with fifteen seconds to spare. Highly recommend this. It was my first time but not my last.
