"Escape room ""Jester's Revenge"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/Memphis-Escape-Rooms-Carnival-Asylum,0,"This escape room is located at the downtown facility. Free parking is easily found nearby on blocks surrounding the location on South Main. Our group of 7 people have done 5 other escape rooms, and we were in awe of the sheer size of this room - very, VERY spacious and large. It was the largest escape room we've ever done. This particular escape room is perfect for a large group as several people can be performing various puzzles at the same time. Just remember that TEAMWORK is essential to solving this room. The puzzles were wonderfully circus-themed, and really fun to solve. The staff at this location were so wonderfully enthusiastic, paid astute attention to detail, and really made the entire experience so much better. This is easily one of my most favorite rooms to work with a full group."

We escaped w/ only 3 minutes remaining and we were all so stoked! I haven't had a chance to get out much lately between kids and work and this was the perfect way for me to get out and enjoy myself! Plus it was kinda an early outing for my birthday Monday so what a great way to bring it in! I can't wait to go back and try out another room! I definitely recommend this for anyone that like puzzles, mysteries, or just likes to put their brain power to use!"
"Escape room ""Jester's Revenge"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/Memphis-Escape-Rooms-Carnival-Asylum,7,"This is an awesome experience everyone should enjoy! I surprise my boyfriend with a trip here for our anniversary and we had a blast. It was a rush trying to figure everything out. We went to the Halloween themed room Carnival Asylum. We worked with 8 other people, which you'd think would be a bit much seeing as we didn't know any of them, but wasn't at all. We got to work with a group of people who all think differently and help each other out. It was a good way to meet new people and just have a really good time. I think this place is going to do very well in Memphis. The staff is great and very informative. It is something different to do and it is an amazing experience. I would recommend this place to everyone."
