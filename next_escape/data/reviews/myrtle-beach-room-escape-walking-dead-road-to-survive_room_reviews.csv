"Escape room ""Walking Dead – Road to Survive"" by Myrtle Beach Room Escape in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/myrtle-beach-room-escape-walking-dead-road-to-survive,0,This was our first experience with an escape room and we couldn't have been more pleased. Sierra (Sprite) did a fantastic job getting us going and providing the occasional hint for the newbies. We did the zombie room and the walking dead similarities made it even more enjoyable. May go back today to do the theater room.

You need to buy tickets online but I love that you can see what times and how many people bought tickets for that same time. All rooms hold up to 10 people, we got lucky and went for the 6pm availability and it was just four of us. While we didn't escape because the room was designed for 6 plus players we still had an amazing time. I highly recommend this location! This was my 3rd escape room and this was by far my fav. Loved all the details the room had to offer! Good Luck!"

We did the zombie room. It was a little difficult because we were overthinking it, but we got out and found all of the items with time to spare. Definitely recommend!"
