"Escape room ""CSI: Case Reopened"" by Escape Room Entertainment in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/the-escape-zone-csi-homicide,0,"We played CSI. Great fun! Challenging, without being competitive. Doesn't work like anything I've ever played and I highly recommend it. Be warned, this could be addictive!Thanks Escape Room Entertainment for such a fun time doing something so totally different."

Since this was our first Escape Room experience, we did the easiest room (CSI). I was unsure if this was going to be fun or if we'd be bickering the whole time but it was a blast. It was simultaneously harder and easier than I expected; way more puzzles but when you have a bunch of people working on them they get solved pretty quickly. We are definitely interested in going back and doing the Shipwrecked room."

We will be back, we are hooked.Thankfully we were able to solve the case with a little over 15 minutes to spare.I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a very fun experience. Our group ages ranged from 11 to 59 and each and everyone of us LOVED our time solving the CSI case.Thank you Escape Room Staff for such a fun experience!!!"

I have done two rooms and they have both been phenomenal. Can't wait to do all of them and hopefully solve a third one. I recommend this to anyone looking to have a great time.

Coming in I didn't know what to expect, but now that I have one run under my belt, I know what it's all about. I would recommend this to anyone! I have never done an escape room in till now!"
