"Escape room ""Carnival"" by Escape The Puzzle in Long Branch",https://worldofescapes.com/long-branch/quests/escape-the-puzzle-carnival,1,Iâ€™ve done quite a few escape rooms and The Carnival definitely rates up there as a favorite! Very clever puzzles and amazing detail in the designs. The owners and staff were so friendly! I will be back to do the other rooms! Highly recommend.
