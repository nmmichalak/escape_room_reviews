"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by MindTrap Escape Room in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/mindtrap-escape-room-gold-rush,2,"This was our first escape room and I can honestly say it was fantastic! Gold Rush is an exceptionally well-designed room. Every single detail of the room speaks to the theme! The owners' attention to detail exudes from the walls. You receive the 5D experience where all of your senses convince you that you are in Jacks cabin. From temperature to sounds, smells and more.Six adults and 3 children played their hearts out and are now hooked to this kind of entertainment! There were plenty of things to keep us all occupied but not too many to overwhelm us (we were all first timers). The kids contributed to a lot. We used a few hints and we escaped with 2 seconds to spare. The staff was so customer focused! Can't wait to go back for Conspiracy!"

The room is very well designed making it entertaining for adults and children. The puzzles are neither too hard nor too easy but just right. Customer service is impeccable. My son can't wait to go back to experience their 2nd room -Conspiracy.

We literally had ten seconds left. We had a group with ages 6-62 and we all had a blast. Thank you to our host - she was amazing! My kids can’t stop talking about it and we can’t wait to do another one. We will definitely be back.
