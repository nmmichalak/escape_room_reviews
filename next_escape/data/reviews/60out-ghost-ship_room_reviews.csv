"Escape room ""Ghost Ship"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-ghost-ship,0,We had the awesome opportunity to experience both The Hangover and Ghost Ship rooms. Happy to say we escaped both. Our favorite was the Ghost Ship. Next time we are in LA we want to give Grandma's Master Plan a try! Highly recommend 60out!

It was their first escape room and they fell in love! It was great because the story progressed after doing each puzzle. Ghost Ship is my favorite room at the Melrose location. The first puzzle was so fun and it perfectly set the mood for the rest of the room. Some puzzles were high tech and involved things I had never seen before. Even though it had a spooky vibe, I would say it's kid-friendly."

Lots of interesting puzzles involving props that look fairly innocuous. My partner and I did it by ourselves and had a great time (and got out), but struggled a bit just because there were only two bodies to use; I think others would benefit from having a larger group for this room because there's a fair amount of stuff going on."

The room looked professional with great and funny service. For our first time we did good but did not escape. Highly recommend with a group to get the night going.

They are efficient, professional and passionate about their rooms. I have done rooms all over the city and these guys are the best! I can't wait to finish there rooms and move on to their new ones next month! "
