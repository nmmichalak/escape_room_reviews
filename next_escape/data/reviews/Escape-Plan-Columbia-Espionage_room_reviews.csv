"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Plan Columbia in Columbia",https://worldofescapes.com/columbia/quests/Escape-Plan-Columbia-Espionage,0,"I was skeptical about being paired with 6 other strangers with our group of four. To my surprise, we all worked really well together and deactivated the bomb and had a blast doing it."
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Plan Columbia in Columbia",https://worldofescapes.com/columbia/quests/Escape-Plan-Columbia-Espionage,1,"Way more fun than I expected. I went with a friend a couple of weeks ago & haven't been able to stop talking about it yet. Our group did the Espionage room. Challenging, but we beat it. The staff was great, the room was fun & I would recommend to anyone. Can't wait to go back and try another of the rooms."
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Plan Columbia in Columbia",https://worldofescapes.com/columbia/quests/Escape-Plan-Columbia-Espionage,2,"To anyone having second guesses about trying out Escape Plan Columbia, allow this review to remove any and all doubts. Having completed both of the rooms currently offered (first Espionage and then Missing), I can say that you will have a blast with either one. The staff is incredibly friendly to experienced puzzle solvers and newbees alike. The rooms are designed for teamwork to flourish and fun to be had. I went with five friends each time and everyone had an incredible time. The only downside is that I can't go back and relive it all again. I cannot wait for new rooms to be added and I will come back immediately once they are available to the public."

We have been so several exit room type games but this one really was the best yet! Owner and his wife are very friendly and personable!"

The staff was great, they really get you amped up for the escape rooms and provide you with certain details that may or may not be needed.(wink). I definitely recommend this place to any and everyone that likes adventure and good laughs."
