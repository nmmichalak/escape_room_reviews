"Escape room ""End of the Line"" by Operation: Escape Room in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/operation-escape-room-dixmonte,0,"I just came from the escape room with my family and it was such a blast.  We went for my sisters birthday.  It was our first time so we did the Dixmonte escape room, they have four to choose from.  Before you go into the room you watch a short instructional video and then they go over the storyline, once your in the room you have 60 minutes to solve the puzzle and escape.  It really makes you work together as a team, you can't move on until you solve each puzzle.  Unfortunately we didn't escape there were a couple of pieces we just couldn't get, but we had fun.  I definitely would try it again it's fun with a group of 5 or 6 people."

The staff was great and friendly! Very clean and organized. They have lockers to lock your personal belongings and a clean restroom. The room was very challenging and fun! I would love to do this again!

It was a great experience. The staff was helpful and pleasant. We did the Dixmonte room. We had never been to an escape room before, I'm glad we started with that one. We will definitely be back."
