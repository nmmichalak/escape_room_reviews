"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,0,This was such a fun activity to do with friends. We laughed a lot and are still talking about it. We will come back for sure!
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,1,This was fun! I so would do it again! You have to really go when your mind is right! Lol... It can be hard and is a mind game for sure!
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,2,Had so much fun! Will definitely be returning! I wasn't expecting to have so much fun but it makes for a good group activity and team building exercise. You must bring your A game though because it is not easy at all. Wish there were more places like this in ATL!
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,3,We had so much fun! The shouts of joy when we discovered each little piece of the puzzle were amazing. Getting the door open with 1min30sec to spare was even better.

"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,5,"This was our first time doing an Escape Room. The setup was good overall, but I felt like too many times we had to ""start from scratch"" by finding some obscurely hidden thing, rather than a linear(ish) sequence of logical or related steps. There are some exceptions, like one or two threads in particular that I am thinking of, but overall I felt like it was more ""find random stuff"" than intellectually challenging puzzles. Also, one of the devices had major issues (or our randomly partnered people who were using it all had major issues), which complicated things significantly. I have also gone to Mission Escape, and I would definitely go back there first on the strength of their puzzles and the construction/ordering of the challenges, but I would also certainly come back to Escape the Room as well. Solid, very good, but not the best of what we've been to."

I think this is a great office team building idea. You get to pick one of three themed rooms to participate in. You are locked in the room for 60 minutes, during which time you have to solve the clues that are strategically placed all over the room. The clues are designed to help you ""escape the room"". If you don't solve the puzzle after the 60 minutes is over, you can still exit the room :)You don't get a prize if you get out within 60 minutes, but you do get bragging rights :)This is my first time to try this sort of place though, so I have no comparison with other ""Escape the Room"" places. But it was great nonetheless."
