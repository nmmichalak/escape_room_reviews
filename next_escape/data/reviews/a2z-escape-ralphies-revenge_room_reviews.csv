"Escape room ""Ralphie's Revenge"" by A2Z Escape in Hays",https://worldofescapes.com/hays/quests/a2z-escape-ralphies-revenge,0,"Our family of 7 solved the Christmas themed escape room at A2Z Escape. It was so much fun, cleverly put together, and very challenging. The codes and clues were amazing. Lots of ""aha"" moments. I highly recommend this activity for any group. Fun for families and parties. And would also be great for team building for a work group or organization. Thanks Jerry and Janet for a good time."
