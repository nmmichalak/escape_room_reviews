"Escape room ""Tony's Bistro"" by ESCAPE:chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-chandler-tonys-bistro,0,"We had family visiting over the holidays, and tried to do something different each day. The day we did Tony's Bistro at Escape: Chandler was the most fun day!  Of the 8 of us, none had previously done an escape room. We got as many hints and clues as we wanted, and escaped with 25 seconds to spare!  If you're looking for a fun adventure, I highly recommend this place, it was challenging and so much fun!"

Did the Tony's Bistro room and had a blast. The room felt very realistic and the clues that we were lead through were just enough - not hard/to the point where it was impossible, but rather involved the right amount of thinking. Took us just under the hour to finish. Not only was the actual room experience great, but the staff was SO friendly! Zuzu was our game master and she was incredibly sweet and kept the whole experience fun from start to finish. Would definitely recommend!"

Wanted to do something for our daughter-in-laws birthday so 5 of us did Tony's Bistro. Kate was so welcoming and helpful and we even got some extra ""birthday"" help! Room was very detailed and even though challenging, we had the best time. Definitely want to do the other rooms next time we visit our son and daughter-in-law!!"
