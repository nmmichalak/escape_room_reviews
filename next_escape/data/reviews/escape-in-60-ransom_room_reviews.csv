I honestly didn't know what to expect, but it was challenging and incredibly fun. We didn't make it out, but came close! We're looking forward to doing it again."
"Escape room ""Ransom"" by Escape in 60 in Charleston",https://worldofescapes.com/charleston/quests/escape-in-60-ransom,1,This place is absolutely amazing! Everyone there is so friendly and they take good care of you. The room kept us busy and it was a little challenging. We did the Ransom theme and I absolutely loved it. I had so much fun and can not wait to go back. If you're looking for something fun to do I highly suggest that you go here.

I say attempted as there were just two of us, and it would hold six. Undauntedly we entered, and were supported by Demi for the hour we spent. Apparently, we did really well, and given another ten minutes, we would have completed it. I'll take that.I would recommend this company, and this location, highly."
