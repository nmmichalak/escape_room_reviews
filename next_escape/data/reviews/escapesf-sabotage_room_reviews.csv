"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-sabotage,0,"It was really cool. The game was super fun and challenging. We bring our inters there and they loved it. They do have a great Italian restaurant on the first floor of the building, so we went there right after our game. "

It’s like an escape game but need to get into this suitcase. It looks like a high end movie prop, with keypad on top, and you get some gadgets to pick codes and such. Than it opens to more puzzles and another level and another level. Very clever. The military guy on TV gave some story about evil corporation and we worked on 8 cases at different tables. Ended up helping each other otherwise we probably wouldn’t have finished it in time. Their “secret safe house” was a bit hard to find. Check the address in the email. we went to their main office first but it’s just a block away. No big deal. "
