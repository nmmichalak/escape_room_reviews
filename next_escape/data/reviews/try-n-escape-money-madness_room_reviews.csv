"Escape room ""Money Madness"" by Try'n Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/try-n-escape-money-madness,0,Money Madness was a lot of fun for the family. You get to choose how hard it is (you don't have to ask for hints). I will say that it sometimes gets crowded in some areas while everyone is trying to help.

They did the bank vault room and had a great time. They escaped with 6 minutes to spare. The whole ride home they all planned their next time to go and try a different room. Highly recommend, the staff was very friendly as well."
