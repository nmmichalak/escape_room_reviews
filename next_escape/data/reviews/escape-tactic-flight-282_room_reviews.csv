"Escape room ""Flight 282"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-flight-282,0,"After completing 20+ rooms, we were really excited to do Flight 282. Since we have completed all of the rooms in our area, our group decided to travel almost 4 hours to do this room. The room didn’t disappoint! It was well thought out, the puzzles were engaging and unique and the decorations were spot on. We made it out but our one disappointment was that the final clue didn’t work. Bree, our awesome cluemaster, came in and tried to fix the prop but it just couldn’t be fixed at that point. Since our time kept running while we, and then she, tried to make it work, we really have no idea of our actual time, which is ok. She finally described the final clue and we finished the room.I’m sure this is isolated and could certainly happen anywhere. Don’t miss these rooms. Hopefully, we’ll travel back again at some point to do another room at Escape Tactic."

"Escape room ""Flight 282"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-flight-282,2,"Flight 282: Decided to try an escape room with extended family, many of whom had never been to an escape room before. Escape Tactic was fabulous! Very elaborate and detailed room and attentive staff. Puzzles were challenging with the unlimited hints allowing you to make the room really as easy or difficult as you wish. The room was top notch and would be at the top in even the toughest market."
