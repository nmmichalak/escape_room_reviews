"Escape room ""KAOS"" by PA Escape Rooms in Scranton",https://worldofescapes.com/scranton/quests/pa-escape-rooms-kaos,0,"That was the most fun I've had in a long time! I went with my boyfriend and we were in a group with 6 strangers. We were in KAOS and at first, I thought it would be awkward. But it turned out to be really fun to work together with people you don't know and solve puzzles. We didn't make it out, but we were so close! I definitely can't wait to try the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""KAOS"" by PA Escape Rooms in Scranton",https://worldofescapes.com/scranton/quests/pa-escape-rooms-kaos,1,We had a group of 6 for the KAOS room and it was very cool seeing how each member was able to contribute something unique. The puzzles were really diverse and allowed each of us to shine! I would highly recommend trying one of these and I want to come back again to try another.
