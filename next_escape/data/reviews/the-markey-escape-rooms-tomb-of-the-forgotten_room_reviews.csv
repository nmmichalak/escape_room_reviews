"Escape room ""Tomb of the Forgotten"" by The Markey Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/the-markey-escape-rooms-tomb-of-the-forgotten,0,"This place is great for a double date! Reserving an escape room for 4 people ensures you have the room to yourself. We had an AWESOME time adventuring through the Tomb of the Forgotten. We had a few hints along the way, but none were too obvious to where we feel like we were handed the answer to it. Very well designed and operated! We will be coming back."

This was a great outing, almost solved it utilizing only a few clues.   Variety of puzzles to solve, good props, friendly family business, will be back when the next rooms open!"
