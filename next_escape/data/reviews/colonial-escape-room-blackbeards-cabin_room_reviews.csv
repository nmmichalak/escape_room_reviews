"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Cabin"" by Colonial Escape Room in Williamsburg",https://worldofescapes.com/williamsburg/quests/colonial-escape-room-blackbeards-cabin,0,"This escape room was our first one ever!  It was a really great experience.  We enjoyed the challenging puzzles and the decor of the room.  We made a mistake of hanging our jackets on top of a clue, so be careful where you put your belongings.  Overall it was an awesome room that began our love for escape rooms.  "

We didn't want to ask questions thinking that it would be like cheating, but being that was our first experience in an escape room we really should have utilized the nudges. But it was fun nonetheless!"
"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Cabin"" by Colonial Escape Room in Williamsburg",https://worldofescapes.com/williamsburg/quests/colonial-escape-room-blackbeards-cabin,2,Great experience! We went as a group of six and we had many laughs! We completed Blackbeard's Cabin. It was a small room with neat decor and the puzzles were challenging but we solved them all! We will visit again.
"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Cabin"" by Colonial Escape Room in Williamsburg",https://worldofescapes.com/williamsburg/quests/colonial-escape-room-blackbeards-cabin,3,We visited the Blackbeard room yesterday and we loved it! The puzzles were really challenging and we just barely opened the treasure with a couple of minutes to spare. We had our 13 and 10-year-old with us as well and they had a blast finding the clues and helping us put it all together. The staff did a great job and helped us out with a couple hints that didn't give too much away. We can't wait to visit again and try the massacre room!

Very fun! The puzzles were very clever; not impossible but you have to put some thought into it. We managed to make it pretty much to the end without getting on each other’s nerves (and a handful of hints for the young man on duty). Will definitely try one of their other rooms in the future!"
