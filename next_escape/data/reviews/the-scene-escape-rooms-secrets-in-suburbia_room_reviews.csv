"Escape room ""Secrets in Suburbia"" by Breach Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-scene-escape-rooms-secrets-in-suburbia,0,"Located in an anonymous industrial park off Lambert Street near Lake Forest Drive, The Scene Escape Rooms is a little hard to find but definitely worth the effort. If you’ve never experienced an escape room, the way it works is that your group (in our case, a family of five) is locked in a room and is given 60 minutes to find the way out by solving different puzzles and finding related clues that eventually lead to the key that will open the door to freedom and victory.The reception area is attractive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. We tackled the “Secrets in Suburbia” room, a murder mystery set in a suburban neighborhood circa 1962. The room was well-designed and nicely themed, and the puzzles were detailed and logical. NOTE that there is some math involved in one puzzle, so it may be helpful to bring a calculator – fortunately, my son is an engineer and easily handled the math problems.This was my fourth experience with an escape room, and “Secrets in Suburbia” was probably the room I’ve enjoyed the most so far. I would certainly recommend The Scene!"

I was a little worried how we would handle trying to solve the puzzles together but we all did great. The staff is awesome as well. They were very kind and friendly which made our time there even better. If you haven't tried an Escape room before, you have to try The Scene Escape Rooms. I cannot wait for their next room to open."
