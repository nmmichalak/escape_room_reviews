"Escape room ""Shaken, Not Stirred"" by Great Escape Delaware in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/great-escape-delaware-shaken-not-stirred,0,Great experience! Did the Shaken not Stirred room. Ralph even took requests for background music and found a bunch of Bond songs for us :) Plus the added humor on the screen from him was hilarious! Clues were challenging and we barely finished with just under 5 minutes to spare! Super fun time with the family!!
