"Escape room ""Game of Espionage"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-orlando-game-of-espionage,0,"We had a GREAT time with family. We did the Espionage Room as we had a young one (6 yo) that didn't like scary things. EVERYONE had fun doing the room. Everyone was able to come up with an answer to one of the challenges or questions.Would highly recommend this to couples, groups or family with people of any age. Just take into consideration the age of the children and whet they can handle.Would definitely do this again! ! ! !"

We had an issue with a nearby escape room company yesterday that somehow lost our friend's reservation, so they sent us to Breakout and the ladies at the counter created a later game just so we could all do a game together. We did Espionage and it was the hardest game we've ever done, but there were only 3 of us when it's made for a big group. I definitely want to go back and try one of their hardest rooms with a few more people! Y'all are awesome and we will definitely be back."
"Escape room ""Game of Espionage"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-orlando-game-of-espionage,2,The Espionage room was an hour worth of fun! The eight people in our party were going back and forth trying to understand the riddles. Something that's great for the family and to test your brain!
