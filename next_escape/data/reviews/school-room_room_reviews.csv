"Escape room ""Abandoned School"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/school-room,0,We had a great time in the school room. Our guide was wonderful. Excellent all around.
"Escape room ""Abandoned School"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/school-room,1,I took my daughter and her friends here for her 12th birthday- they did the abandoned school room and loved it!!! Jordyn was such a friendly and fun operator- she was great with the girls! Thank you for providing a new idea for a party!!!
"Escape room ""Abandoned School"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/school-room,2,"Very different than what I originally expected when I read ""panic room"". Such an exciting and intruding experience! We tried the brand new Abandoned School Room with a group of friends and all really enjoyed working together to figure out the clues and puzzles! I highly recommend the Austin Panic Room!"
"Escape room ""Abandoned School"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/school-room,3,Took a group of my cousins and my brothers to try out Austin Panic Room.  All 10 of us had never been and did not know what to expect.  We got to try one of their newer rooms: School Room.  Makena was really genuine and sweet as our host and we ESCAPED!! We had a little over 3 minutes left - it was such a thrill! This is not easy- you need everyone's ideas and inputs because there are so many things you have to do to get out.  Use generic questions (you get 7) and try to stay organized.  Having been our first time we were putting things we discovered all over the place which then confused us down the line.  Such a fun experience and we were still talking about it days later.  Very very clever clues and puzzles and we can't wait to do it again in another room!
"Escape room ""Abandoned School"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/school-room,4,"5 stars because my team and I were able to escape!! YAYYYYYYYY #blessBut in all seriousness, this place is a great place to go with a group of friends if you guys like logic problems and puzzles. Personally, before APR, I had never seen/heard of places where you go in and attempt to solve your way out. The first time I went, my team and I went to the bomb room (at the original location, back when they only had one room). Unfortunately, we ran out of time RIGHT after figuring out the combination for the last lock. Still bitter about it to this day, but it was a really exhilarating time for my team and I. The second time I went, it was FOR FREE! (The cost is usually $20/person, but it's not too bad because it's for the experience) My friend got a ticket from one of their promotions they were having and we were able to do the new school room. In my opinion, it was easier than the bomb room, but things have changed and been troubleshooted since I last was locked in for an hour at APR.Make sure you really pay attention to everything!! Clues are everywhere, anywhere, and everything. Also, they give you a pen and paper for a reason--try to use it, because it does help with some kind of organization and you know what clues you have already used, etc. Most importantly, try to cooperate with everyone and listen to what people have to say because the point of the game is to work with your team, not a solo game.It's a really interesting experience if you have never been locked in a room for an hour, while expected to solve puzzles to escape. The staff are really friendly, and you get to take pictures with your team, whether y'all are able to escape or not. But if your team escapes, you get a polaroid taken of your group and they put it up for on their escape wall (or whatever they call it)!"
