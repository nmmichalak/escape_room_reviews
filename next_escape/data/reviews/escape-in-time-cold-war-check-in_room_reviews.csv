"Escape room ""Road Trip '66"" by The Fantastic Escape! in Cedar Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/cedar-rapids/quests/escape-in-time-cold-war-check-in,0,We had a group of eight with mixed ages and had a great time. We played the Cold War room and loved the period elements throughout. The staff took their time in making sure we were all setup and gave appropriate support throughout. Welcoming and friendly place. We plan to visit again!
