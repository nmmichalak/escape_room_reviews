"Escape room ""Murder! Mystery!"" by Excape Games in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/excape-games-murder-mystery,0,"My family played the murder mystery room. I love the props and decor. It really immerses you in the game. The staff are super helpful, as well. Our room guide gave us well timed but still puzzling hints and we still only just got out! We'll be back for the other rooms ASAP!"
"Escape room ""Murder! Mystery!"" by Excape Games in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/excape-games-murder-mystery,1,"My friend and I️ decided to do the Murder Mystery room. Our game master, June, was the best game master we’ve had so far in all of our escape rooms we’ve done. She was helpful with giving us clues when she thought we needed them and even learned our names. After the room, we conversed about the room and other rooms there were. We both can’t wait to go back and do more rooms!"

We were the first group to break the code on the new Murder Mystery room and get out, with only a few minutes to spare but we did it. I can't wait to go back and try the Abandon Ship and Jailbreak rooms. The owner's are awesome too, so we will definitely be back!"

We played the Murder Mystery room for my friend's bachelorette party. The staff there is super friendly and showed us around the place when we were done. Can't wait to come again. Thanks for doing such a great job!
