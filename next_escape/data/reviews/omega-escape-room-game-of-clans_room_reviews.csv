"Escape room ""Game of Clans"" by Omega Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/omega-escape-room-game-of-clans,0,My daughter and her friends did the Clash of Clans room and had a blast!! A great escape room & I highly recommend it!! Definitely would go again
"Escape room ""Game of Clans"" by Omega Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/omega-escape-room-game-of-clans,1,"4 of us decided to do the Game of Clans room at Omega Escape room.  This room was awesome! The four of us have done many escape rooms before, and this room was the perfect difficulty level. Some easier puzzles to gain confidence, and a couple puzzles that may require a hint. The linearity of the room sequence was a very nice touch...one puzzle leads to another puzzle. I hate it when an escape room is complete chaos. They are currently working on some new rooms. I can't wait to see what Omega has in store for the future...we will be back!"

My group of 4 completed the house of clans and really loved it! It was the perfect level of difficulty. I didn't love the way the hints were offered because they have a TV in the room where you can grab hints at any time without penalty. I don't think anyone really watches and guides you like other escape rooms. Because of this, when we escaped, there was no one at the other side of the escape door to congratulate us and it was pretty uneventful. Very sad :( But we really loved the room and will be back soon to check out the others!"
