"Escape room ""Ghost Hotel"" by Great Room Escape in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/great-room-escape-layton-ghost-hotel,0,Granddaughter chose to do this as a birthday event.  So we did the Haunted Hotel. It was really fun and we had to really work hard but we did escape with less than 2 minutes. Highly recommend. Staff is great. We want to go back and do another room. Communication is key within your group.
