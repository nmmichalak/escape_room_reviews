We took our kids and we did the ""Imprisoned"" room. It was a surprise for all 5 of our kids, ranging from 10-15. We really had to work as a team and managed to escape with just a minute to spare! There were smiles the rest of the day and continual praise for the experience!The staff could not be more amazing! I already want to go back!"

The staff was cheerful and helpful, and the clues they gave were great as well. We were floored by the details that went into our room, and we had a blast trying to keep track of all the clues. The puzzles were the right amount of challenging, and they throw in some fantastic twists that made it even better. We hadn't even left the parking lot before we started planning our next trip back. I can't recommend it enough!"

The staff was very helpful and friendly, from the booking of the room and the party space to the end of the game and clean up. I highly recommend!"
