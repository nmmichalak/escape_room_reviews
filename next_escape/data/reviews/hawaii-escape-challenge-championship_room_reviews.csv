"Escape room ""Championship"" by Hawaii Escape Challenge in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/hawaii-escape-challenge-championship,1,Super fun. Good for bonding with your team/group. Fun mental challenge with a twist. I did it with my youth ministry team & used each other's strengths to finish the challenge. We completed the task in getting the championship trophy with just over 2min to spare. Would we do it again?! Of course!

It was very challenging and exciting. The customer service provided by the people running the game and the front was perfect. I will be back again to try out the other rooms available.
