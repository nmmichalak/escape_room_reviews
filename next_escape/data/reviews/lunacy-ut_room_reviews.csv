"Escape room ""Lair of Lunacy"" by The Escape Key in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/lunacy-ut,0,"I've now done two rooms (CSI and Lunacy) with some friends. They were both awesome. Each room has great clues, and had different levels of difficulty. We all felt challenged but we still solved both rooms. There were five of us and that was the perfect number. We were each able to contribute and we weren't on top of each other in the room."
"Escape room ""Lair of Lunacy"" by The Escape Key in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/lunacy-ut,1,Had a great time! It took everyone in our group working together but we made it out just in time! Would definitely recommend giving the Lair of Lunacy a try!

The 8 of us solved the puzzle and got out of the room with about 15 mins to spare.  It was a great time.  Great value.  We can't wait to go again."
