"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/breakout-games-columbus-runaway-train,0,"I went with my mom, my brother, and his girlfriend, and we were the only four to tackle the ""Runaway Train"" room. The room itself was very cleverly designed and the puzzles difficult but rewarding. The building was very clean and comfortable, the check in process smooth and easy, and the service very friendly and enthusiastic. I'm just now getting into escape rooms but I'll definitely be back here to feed my budding addiction."

The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had 6 people in our group. I think 4 would have been a perfect number. My group really enjoyed it! No extra money for the picture at the end was a nice bonus.
