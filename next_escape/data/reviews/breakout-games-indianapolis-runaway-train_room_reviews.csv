We all had a LOT of fun doing 3 escape rooms at Breakout. The Runaway Train was super fantastic, and Island Escape and Mystery Mansion were great too. We broke out of all rooms with some hints. It was great fun for all."

What an awesome time. We did the runaway train and it weas a great exercise in group problem solving. Can't wait to go back and try another senario.

This is a perfect venue for a couple, a family, a corporate event, etc.We did the runaway train challenge and it was our first time ever in an escape room. There's something to be said for experience - some aspects require less examination and some require more. Going thru a room once will give you a much better idea of which aspects fall into which bucket.Staff will chime in on the speaker if/when they see you doing something that's obviously wrong or if they see you struggling. You will need these ""Big Brother"" guides, hints, or whatever you want to call them."
