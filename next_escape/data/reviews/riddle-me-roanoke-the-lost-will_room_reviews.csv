We only had what we had seen on tv and movies to go by. The family-owners are wonderful and help make the experience that much better.

We have been to another escape room in Baltimore and we loved this one just as much. The atmosphere was clean and the room (the last will) was well thought out. My daughter was ready to go in and do another one. Thank you for the fun.
