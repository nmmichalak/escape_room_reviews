Well balanced and a good amount of challenging but not over the top puzzles. The room is very well themed and well thought out. A rare room that will play well for beginners as well as experienced players. Can't wait to see the Toy room."
"Escape room ""Pirate Captain"" by Escape Games Riverside in Redlands",https://worldofescapes.com/redlands/quests/escape-games-riverside-pirate-captain,3,We went here for my daughter's 14th birthday. She and her friends had a ton of fun. The room was decorated really great and the puzzles were a ton of fun. We escaped with the treasure with 5 min to spare. Can't wait to try their other room soon!

Two of our group had never done an escape room and the other two of us were doing our second. We had so much fun - definitely going back to do the other room. Highly recommend!"
