"Escape room ""The Cure"" by Paradox Emporium in Bradley",https://worldofescapes.com/bradley/quests/paradox-emporium-the-cure,0,"The Cure room was both challenging and fun. I was on a team of 7 people and we escaped with only 5 minutes to spare. 4 stars because I wish the aura in the room was more thematic. Great experience, would go back if and when they open a new room scenario."

"Escape room ""The Cure"" by Paradox Emporium in Bradley",https://worldofescapes.com/bradley/quests/paradox-emporium-the-cure,3,Had 12 boys ages 10-12 who tried the escape room for my sons birthday! They had a blast! The guys that were there tonight were amazing with the kids. (Even though it's hard to get all them to focus at the same time lol) A must try!!
