"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-villains-lair,0,"My wife and I as well as another couple had been referred to play here from owners of another escape room. We are so happy we went! The three games were all great. The Lab is a great intro room - tweens/teens would like it as would rookie escapers. We did AI and it was also fun. Villainâ€™s Lair ended up being our favorite despite us not getting out (20 more seconds, so close!!). Sabrina was great as our game master and is definitely an asset to the company. Definitely check this place out if you like good and intuitive rooms with great scenery."
"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-villains-lair,1,"This is the 3rd escape room I've done, first two in LA. I thought this one was awesome! We did the villains lair (escaping a North Korean jail) that has a 23% pass rate. Our host was super nice in getting us set up and explaining things. Id recommend for sure and would be back!"
"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-villains-lair,2,"Did both the newest Villain's Lair and the AI escape rooms here. I thought the AI room was more of a room that was rated 4, and the Villain's Lair a 4.5.Both rooms were extremely different, but very engaging. My group of six with varied levels of experience had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles which required some thinking out of the box for both rooms and a lot of running around.I'd recommend at least a group of four for Villain's Lair and no less than four. I think we benefited from having six people because for both AI and Villain's Lair there were a couple puzzles that definitely helped having more people, not less, which is the opposite of what I find for most escape rooms. (I find 4 to be the perfect number). Having spent a lot of time surveying other escapers to find out what rooms would work for a larger group, we settled on Exit Game, and I'm glad we did! Escaping in time definitely relied on teamwork!For Villain's Lair there was a greater level of detail put into the room than in AI, and a lot less button pushing. However, there is one puzzle in Villain's Lair that requires a lot more abstract thinking and may or may not take your group longer to figure out. When we went, the ""alarm"" was speeding up which made a couple of us think we had lost and didn't escape when we still had 7 minutes left when we escaped! Since it was new to the San Diego space, we figured it was expected that they would still have issues and gave them feedback.For AI the details of the rooms were a lot less immersive than Villain's Lair, and I felt most of the puzzles required button pushing. I liked the use of technology and the use of a computer. A few of the puzzles really forced ourselves to think outside of the box. Once you have ""escaped"" you can choose to do hard mode, which our group chose to do.Villain's Lair we were told was a mix of traditional locks and technology (a mix of AI and The Lab basically), of which our group enjoyed more personally. AI is more technology and have no real locks that I can think of, and The Lab which we haven't done is more a traditional lock type room.I really liked our game master, who gave us appropriate clues without revealing too much, just the way we like it, via walkie talkies for both rooms.I'd definitely add Exit Games as one of the top Escape Room companies in San Diego. My group will be back to do their last room, The Lab."
