"Escape room ""Nicodemus: Demon of Evanishment VR"" by The Void Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-void-las-vegas-nicodemus-demon-of-evanishment,0,"I did the Nicodemus experience with 3 friends last weekend.  I've played games with other VR systems before and this was a level beyond that.  It's really immersive. You can see everyone in your group in character as their avatar, and interact with them and the environment. Being able to walk around and explore and interact with the world was a really cool experience. The fair exhibits you could interact with were a lot of fun.  And the haptic feedback during the scary parts was great. It really feels like you're in the middle of a movie.  The ""puzzles"" to solve weren't really hard like some escape rooms but they were fun. The staff was awesome too. They worked really hard to be sure everyone has a great experience. I'm looking forward to going back for the Star Wars experience."

Had so much fun. Never did VR before and it will not be my last. Staff was great and they walked you through it all the way.

It was not only fully immersive and interactive but it was fun as ****! The staff is great, helpful and knowledgeable... and special thanks to them asking who is braver because, for Nicodemus, you split into twos for a bit and I'd have frozen solid if not with my husband lol My only (minor) complaint is it's not long enough- I could stay in there for an hour AND pay for it! A++ would recommend to tourists and locals- gamers and non-gamers alike."
