"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by ClockWise Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clockwise-escape-room-the-asylum,0,"I've done a good number of escape rooms now, and this ranks high on the list! The waiting area is thoughtfully outfitted with some fun little table games, water, and even chocolate kisses. Then a kind and nice guy led us to the Asylum Room. It looks bare at first, but it is absolutely packed with interesting surprises, sensors, puzzles, logic games, and a few special effects. We definitely needed our three clies. Will return to do the Party in Vegas Room for sure!"

My coworkers and I had a blast escaping the Asylum. It was challenging, and the clues provided were helpful without giving the answers away completely. We dressed in the gowns they had, which was definitely a nice touch. Decor was on point as well. I was very impressed with the amount of technology at this escape room; it's a change from the other escape rooms I've played! Will be back when they introduce a new room!"

It's a step up from all the other escape rooms that I tried in San Francisco. Don't wanna give spoilers, but it was so real.. and creepy lol. Great narrative as well... based on a true story. Hosts are super friendly and funny. Definitely will check out their other rooms!!!"
