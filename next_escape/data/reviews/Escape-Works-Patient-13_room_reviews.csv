"Escape room ""Underneath"" by EscapeWorks in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/Escape-Works-Patient-13,0,"Best escape I've done so far. I've completed 11 games and this one was the best! Great detail and it was just difficult enough. We barely made it out. So much fun too. The atmosphere of "" the underneath"" was so creepy and cool. Would recommend this to anyone. Go try it! You won't be disappointed."
"Escape room ""Underneath"" by EscapeWorks in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/Escape-Works-Patient-13,1,We did the Underneath room and it was so good! The clues and flow of this escape room are by far the best. And our game master had the best scary voice EVER!!! Definitely coming back to do the bunker!
