Even though we weren't successful in The Museum Heist, we had so much fun. I wish that you could pay more for some extra time because I wanted to be able to figure everything out. Emily was a great game master."

Great fun for everyone and everyone has a part in it! Great way for family and friends to spend a very interactive hour together... Something different and really nice and fun for a change! The game master was great as well! Everyone was courteous and helped to make it awesome!!!!!!! 5 stars!!!!!!!

Chose to try this to celebrate my son's birthday with a friend of his. We thought it was going to be a full room but the others decided to not show so there was only 3 of us. At times, we completely thought we had it in the bag - but in the end it was too much for us and we were on the last clue when the buzzer went off. The experience was one that we will never forget.My son is now officially hooked and we will be back!!! Thank you for such a great memory to last forever!"
