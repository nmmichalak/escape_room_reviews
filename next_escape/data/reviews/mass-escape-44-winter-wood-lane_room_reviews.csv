We have done rooms in CT, FL and NJ and rate this one the top! Great multi room experience. The staff was amazing and we had a blast. We are headed back this weekend for the challenge of 44 Winter Wood Lane! So looking forward to our visit."

Six of us did our best to unravel clues. It was challenging and fun! We will definitely be back to try the other room (Ice Station Zero). Thank you!

"Escape room ""44 Winter Wood Lane"" by Mass Escape in New Bedford",https://worldofescapes.com/new-bedford/quests/mass-escape-44-winter-wood-lane,3,I'd highly recommend Mass Escape (New Bedford). This was the first time doing an escape room challenge and I can definitely say it won't be the last time. Our group did the 44 Winter Wood Lane challenge; it was a ton of fun. We're hoping to make it back for the Ice Station Zero room soon!
