It was amazing. Our gamemaster, Jean, did an outstanding job! The clues seamlessly flowed together and the storyline of the room moved with you. Great room, great staff and we will definitely be back for another. We both would highly recommend this place!"

We did this for my husbandâ€™s birthday with our grown kids and grandson. We did the Wizards Keep and it was a great way to interact and enjoy an hour together - well, 45 minutes anyway! Everyone got involved and had fun solving the clues. I would do this again."
