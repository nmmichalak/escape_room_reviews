"Escape room ""Harry Potter Escape"" by Escape Zone Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-zone-li-harry-potter-escape,0,"I have done many escape rooms and liked this one. I went with family members who are also HP fans so we were very excited about the theme. It helps to know HP stuff but it's not a requirement. Definitely kid-friendly, nothing scary and the degree of difficulty was very low. Our game master, Emily, was very friendly and enthusiastic. Only had a problem getting one of the locks to open, so Emily came back in to help us and added the time we had lost back on the clock. I will definitely try another room at this location."

What a great experience. Emily, the game master was so knowledgeable, kind and helpful. The place is a little hard to find because it is in an office building.. just make sure you go in the main entrance. I would definitely recommend it."

They have fun themed rooms that are different!!! We did the Harry Potter room and it was fun. The game master was helpful with the hints and we did finish in time Yay us!!! My 6 yr old was a little scared and one of the locks we did correctly but it didn't open, but we got that time back on the clock and the game master came to fix it. All in all it was a great time and worth the hour drive we took to get there even though we have other rooms closer to home!!!!"
