"Escape room ""Beyond Medusaâ€™s Gate VR"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-beyond-medusas-gate,0,"Recently we tried out their VR games, and they were fine as far as VR games go. They don't quite feel the same as a physical escape room, but were reasonable. Do Assassin's Creed if you want to be in an action movie, and Huxley if you want to be in a virtual escape room."
