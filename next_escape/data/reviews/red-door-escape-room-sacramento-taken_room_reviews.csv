"Escape room ""Taken"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-taken,0,"Had a great experience, didn't solve Taken but got to the last puzzle in the final room. It was a blast with all the puzzles and the time pressure our game master was helpful but didn't give us more than what kept the experience moving and exciting. Totally recommend this to anyone trying to have a unique and fun time."

I went here for a birthday celebration/ cousin bonding and we escaped the ""Taken"" room! It was really fun/challenging and probably one of the best escape rooms I've done thus far. Shoutout to the game master, Malcom, for being so helpful and fun. Definitely excited to come back :)"
