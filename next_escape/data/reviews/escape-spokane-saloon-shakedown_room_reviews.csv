"Escape room ""Saloon Shakedown"" by Escape! Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-spokane-saloon-shakedown,1,"This was our first ever escape room, and we found it fun, challenging, and a great family activity. We did the 'Saloon Heist, and 'lost', but had a great time. My kids, 14 and 12, were able to help and feel useful with the puzzles, but they were just difficult enough for my husband and I to also feel challenged. The theme was SUPER fun and immersive, and the staff was helpful (hints were just that - Hints, not giveaways). We have already discussed another trip next year (this is not our home area) when we visit again."

The room was the best one yet. It was decorated well, not some yard sale with walls and puzzles. The puzzles were great. We didn't escape. But, we laughed the whole time. Brad was fun and certainly enjoys his characters. We can't wait to try another one."
