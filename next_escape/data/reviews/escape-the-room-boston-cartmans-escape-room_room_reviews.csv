"Escape room ""Cartman's Escape Room"" by Escape The Room Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-the-room-boston-cartmans-escape-room,0,"We did the cartman's escape room here as a group of 6. There were a lot of unique features that we really enjoyed (the sounds effects are fantastic ) but ultimately I have to take off a star (I almost took off two) because no one has managed to complete this escape room without any clues, which means that it's a poorly designed escape room!"
"Escape room ""Cartman's Escape Room"" by Escape The Room Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-the-room-boston-cartmans-escape-room,1,Some friends and I did the south park escape room and it was fantastic. So much fun. This was one first escape room. But my friend had done many other and said this was one of the best ever. Very well thought out. I wish I could erase my memory and do it again. Great time.
