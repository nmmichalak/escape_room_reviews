"Escape room ""Tin Star Saloon"" by Escape Room Marlton in Collingswood",https://worldofescapes.com/collingswood/quests/escape-room-challenge-the-heist,0,"We have done about 9 different escape rooms already and this one ranks up there at the top! The two of us did the Heist and got out with a few minutes to spare. This room is really well put together, the clues are solid, all of the mechanics in the room worked well, and the staff was super nice! We will definitely be returning to do all of the other rooms soon."

Both visits were wonderful experiences. The staff is wonderful. I can't wait to go back and would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new!"
