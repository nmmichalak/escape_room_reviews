"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/escapology-myrtle-beach-arizona-shootout,0,"We got trapped in the Arizona Shootout! This is the 1st escape room we've done. There were 8 of us, my husband, myself and our 6 children, ages 3 - 17. Everyone had a blast. We were a little slow at the start but moved quickly after that. Unfortunately we ran out of time on the last puzzle. Still, a great time for the whole family. We will definitely do another one in the future!"
"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/escapology-myrtle-beach-arizona-shootout,1,Me and my girlfriend where on vacation and after looking into doing these back home we figured we give it a go one night and it did not disappoint. We did the Arizona shoutout and our game master was Tylor Mansur who did a fantastic job. He seemed to only give small clues at the perfect times but not to the point of spoiling anything as we wanted to do as much as we could on our own. He also had a very positive attitude and you could tell it was important to him that we had a good time and people like him make doing an escape room even more enjoyable. The clues were put together actually rather well in the Arizona room and it was a ton of fun. We went down to the wire and it made the ending very exciting. We enjoyed our time so much we went back the next day and we are actually most likely going to do the final room before leaving myrtle. If you are looking for something to do and something that is different than the typical mini golf or go carting than you should definitely give this a go and I doubt you will be disappointed. And lastly I love how clean this place is. It is much more welcoming and comforting to walk into a place as clean as this one is ! So keep up the good work!

My friend and I did two of the rooms and loved each one. The Arizona Shootout was more challenging than the Outbreak room but we were able to escape both with minutes to spare. The whole facility was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. I canâ€™t wait to go back and try the last room and if and when they switch the rooms out, to go back and try those too. I highly recommend going and doing an escape room here if you have the time!"
