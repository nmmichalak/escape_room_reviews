It was a fun evening to spend with my friends. And as always it was fun, and the aesthetics were on point"

We had two newbies to the escape room scene who absolutely loved their experience. Challenging and stimulating, this room is full of beautifully imagined clues and props that are perfectly designed. Brian our gamemaster/host was so cool and really made the experience that much better. We will be back for the Mystic Temple!!!!"
"Escape room ""Paradox"" by Rabbit Hole Recreation Services in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/rabbit-hole-recreation-services-paradox,2,"Great experience! Our group of 7, ages 10-65, enjoyed the Paradox challenge. It was just the right amount of difficulty, though we did benefit from some hints along the way. And though only a few members of our group led the way in terms of puzzle-solving, there were little ways that each person could be involved and contribute. The attention to detail throughout the rooms was impressive and really enhanced the experience. Highly recommend!"
