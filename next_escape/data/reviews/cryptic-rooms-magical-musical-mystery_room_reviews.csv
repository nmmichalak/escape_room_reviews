We beat the maestro with little time to spare! First time doing an escape room and it was so much fun. If it's a toss-up between a movie or this, do this! It was just me and my husband and was great for a date night. Will was a great host! Plan on going back soon."

"Escape room ""Magical Musical Mystery"" by Cryptic Rooms in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/cryptic-rooms-magical-musical-mystery,3,"Our family enjoyed completing both of the rooms. The music room was fun and interactive. If you are looking for fun and different, give them a try. Once the word gets out the wait will be long. This is not your typical escape room. It unique and exciting with a new modern fresh twist. Thanks again , Santa's Little Helpers. Beat maniac room 8/28 and music room 9/4."

It was a challenging experience that got both of us thinking and dancing a little too! This would be a great way to spend time with a group of 4-6 friends or family members.The owner is awesome and does a great job running the games. We will definitely be back to try out the other room!
