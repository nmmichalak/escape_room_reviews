"Escape room ""Mystic Mansion"" by Escape Zone 60 in Destin",https://worldofescapes.com/destin/quests/escape-zone-60-mystic-mansion,1,My family and I drove out to FWB just to experience the Mystic Mansion and while we failed at being the world's best paranormal investigators we had a great time! Marlee was warm and welcoming and the hints she gave were fantastic! The room was well-designed with surprises galore! We can't wait to go back and try the Mummy room!

It was challenging but achievable. With two minutes to spare, we made it out. Great activity for a small group. Teens took point and had a ball."

Our family of 5 did the mystic manor. It was creepy but lots of fun. The puzzles were challenging but had lots of clues. We didn't make it out, but that only made us want to do more of them. Definitely worth it."
