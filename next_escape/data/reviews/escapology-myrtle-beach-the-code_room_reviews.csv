"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/escapology-myrtle-beach-the-code,0,"Tried this while visiting Myrtle Beach and oh my gosh....what a blast!! We had a mix of adults, teens and children and everyone absolutely loved this event!! We played The Code and it was challenging, but our game master gave us hints to guide us in the right direction and we escaped! The facility was clean and inviting. We will definitely do this again."
"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/escapology-myrtle-beach-the-code,1,"We've done several escape rooms over the past couple of years, and this is one of the best. The staff were exceptionally polite and conversational. The price was cheaper than some of the other escape rooms we've done at around $98 (that's including tax) for three adults. We did their most difficult room, TH3 COD3 (a 7.3/10 difficulty), and managed to finish with 08:39 remaining. The room itself may look simple and sparse when you first enter, but don't let that fool you. Even though we're not escape room virgins we still had to use a couple of hints. There are plenty of red herrings as well as genuine clues to keep you entertained, making the 60 minutes fly by. We started off slow, but by the end we were yelling, smiling, and working together to beat the clock. At the end of our game, we got to pose with different props for the photo they took, which was then emailed to each of us using the emails we provided to them earlier. So whether you're sunburnt and need a break from the beach, or are just looking for something to do before or after dinner, Escapology Myrtle Beach is a great option, and I'd encourage anyone to give it a shot. Not to mention, they have tshirts available for purchase too. And who doesn't love a good tshirt?"

We finished with less than 8 minutes left. Ian was a great game master and the rest of the staff were so friendly. We're exhausted mentally.
