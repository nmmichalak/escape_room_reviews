"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-jail-break,0,"How fun can finding your way out of a locked room be? Turns out, a lot funner than expected. Went with a group of 7 for a girls night out and we had a blast. We chose the jail break room and finding our way out was challenging and exciting.  First escape room for me, so I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun we had.  Staff was awesome to be around. They were funny and helpful. To top it all off, the facility was clean and comfortable. I'll be back again to check out the other rooms."

Both were well thought out, had easy to follow instructions and Jo was a great help when needed! Highly recommend going here!"
"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-jail-break,2,Great idea for a party after dinner. We had a group of 6 tweens and they had a great time. The owner is very nice and accommodating. Would go there again and do another escape challenge. They did Jail Break and were out in 38 mins.
