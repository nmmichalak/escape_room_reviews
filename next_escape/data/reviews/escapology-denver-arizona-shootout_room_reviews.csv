"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-arizona-shootout,0,"My family and I(Baby Boomer, Gen X, Millennial, and Gen Z, so our bases are covered!) went for Father's Day, and had a blast! We did the Arizona Shootout (which is a little challenging for a group's first time), and ended up running out of time on the last clue. Sean, our incredible Game Master, let us take the extra minute to finish so we wouldn't be left hanging, which was super kind of him. When we're next in Denver, we'll definitely check it out again!"

Will definitely be back for more! We did the Arizona Shootout room. It was easier than expected - but very fun and loved everything about the facility"

Staff is friendly and helpful, the escape rooms are interesting, and the bar/restaurant has a great, adventurous vibe. We didn't have time to grab food or a drink, I'll definitely be back to try! Great place!"
