"Escape room ""CSI: Buffalo Murder Mystery"" by The Exit Rooms in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/the-exit-rooms-csi-buffalo-murder-mystery,0,"I did the CSI Buffalo escape room. If you love Buffalo, you'll enjoy this one. You'll need to apply a little (common) Buffalo knowledge with problem solving skills. We had a big group of people working together (truly on the same page) so we escaped in a fairly reasonable amount of time. I liked the storyline and think others would as well!"

It was in such a well decorated bachelor pad loft, and the game was so much fun! It's like the board game clue, but in real life. My mom and friends had a blast. It was the perfect gift, and I absolutely will return again!"
"Escape room ""CSI: Buffalo Murder Mystery"" by The Exit Rooms in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/the-exit-rooms-csi-buffalo-murder-mystery,2,We did the CSI room last night and it was a blast. Best fathers day present ever. Well planned out clues and excellent decor to make it seem real. We needed all 4 of our teams' contributions to figure it out in 53 minutes. Can't wait to try the nursery one. I will be telling everyone I know to try this.
