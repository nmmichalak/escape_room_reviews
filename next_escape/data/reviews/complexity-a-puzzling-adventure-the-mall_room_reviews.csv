"Escape room ""The Mall"" by Complexity: A Puzzling Adventure in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/complexity-a-puzzling-adventure-the-mall,0,"This was an amazing experience! My daughter had not been to one of these places before and she said that this was a great first choice. We came here with her friend's family (who had a little bit of experience) and chose the room called ""The Mall"". The owner, Michele, who was very kind and informative, told us that this was the most challenging room that they have. And I'll tell you that is 100% true! We did not escape but our ""game master"", Sarah, was very nice and helped us out along the way."

My friends were visiting from Europe so myself and other family members all went to conquer “The Mall!” It was definitely a challenge. Thankfully I had a witty crew that would not give up. With only two or so clues we made it out alive. Due to the difficult nature of this escape room and the variety of props it pays to try to keep everything organized, which we did quite well. Very professional. Very clever. Very, VERY exciting! We can’t wait to go back and experience the other rooms!"
