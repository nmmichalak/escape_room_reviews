"Escape room ""Captain's Maxwell's Shipwrecked"" by TeamEscape 262 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/teamescape-262-captains-maxwells-shipwrecked,0,"We were a group of 5 couples, with one couple having played once before. The objective is to escape from the room (ours was a pirate theme) before 1 hour elapses. It requires that everyone participate in finding, and using, clues to open locked doors and drawers. It’s very challenging, and entertaining. We came within 1 last locked clue of escaping, but our time ran out. All in all, it was a fun time."

They are 11, 12 and 13 years old. We did the Shipwrecked room. The boys all had a really great time, I had to be in there with them because they're all under 16, and it was fun and challenging! Would do another room again!"

The Shipwrecked Room was well thought out and tons of fun! Steve was super pleasant, nice and accommodating! We’re already trying to squeeze in another escape game before we leave!"
