We completed the ""Bank Heist"" on our first try and were so pumped about it that we went for the second room. Fantastic place and great staff who are very knowledgeable! Well worth the money!"
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Augusta",https://worldofescapes.com/augusta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-augusta-bank-heist,1,"Did the Bank Heist because we had a big group with several engineers. Took us too long to get going because we didn’t know what to expect, l guess. Once we started rolling we collected enough cash but ran out of time before we could get out of the door. A good challenge and we’ll definitely come back again."
