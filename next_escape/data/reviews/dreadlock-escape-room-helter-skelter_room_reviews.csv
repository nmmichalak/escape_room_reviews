"Escape room ""Helter Skelter"" by Dreadlock Escape Room in Salina",https://worldofescapes.com/salina/quests/dreadlock-escape-room-helter-skelter,0,"Just completed the Helter Skelter room. It's refreshingly more realistic of a puzzle, because the clues aren't a clear cut trail of breadcrumbs... it takes a divide-and-conquer outlook, and isn't a spectator puzzle. I look forward to returning for their additional rooms soon! Thank you for the experience!"

Every second of the room was so enjoyable. Definitely would recommend this to everyone!
