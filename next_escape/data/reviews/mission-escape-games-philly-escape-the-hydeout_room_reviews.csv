"Escape room ""Escape the Hydeout"" by Mission Escape Games in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mission-escape-games-philly-escape-the-hydeout,0,"This was my first escape room and it was so much fun! It’s designed for 8 people I believe, but it was only two of us so we had to just focus. Our host was so helpful. He only gave us hints when we both agreed on them, and made sure we didn’t waste our time. The Jekyll theme of the room was so cool, and the clues were very well thought out and befitting. We didn’t make it out, but we were very close. We can’t wait to come back. "

Best room we have played, by far. The host was amazing and we were well prepared, well assisted, and had an overall amazing time. Made it out with 9 minutes to spare!"

Had two groups of 6 and everyone had a great time, even though some of my teammates weren't some of the smartest tools in the shed. The puzzles were hard but not impossible. The layouts were set up in a reasonable way also. The theme was pretty neat too! Jekyll and Hyde. Everyone was super attentive and helpful from booking the room to finishing up with photos for our groups at the end."

Originally the room was meant for eight, but Jose was nice enough to allow the 2 of us to figure out the room together. There's a total of 2 rooms to escape from and plenty of locks to figure out. The rooms are dark and triggers are automatic, so keep your eyes and ears sharp!"
