"Escape room ""Phase III: Human Trials"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/dallas-panic-room-phase-3-human-trials,0,"The rooms were so much fun! They have differing levels of difficulty, we did the Phase Three and Cabin Fever, which are the high and medium difficulty, respectively. Danny and Steve were great! Really had a great time!"
"Escape room ""Phase III: Human Trials"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/dallas-panic-room-phase-3-human-trials,1,"We did Phase III. I've done 5 different escape rooms before (4 escapes) and this one was the only one that made me not want to do an escape room ever again. I actually thought it was too difficult and tedious for having to be able to finish in 60 minutes. We are not recorded so when you ask for clues, you have to explain what you need help with. We had first-time escape roomers and they were just all confused about what to do. I have no issues with not escaping a room, but when I just leave mad and never wanting to return is not the feeling I'm seeking."
"Escape room ""Phase III: Human Trials"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/dallas-panic-room-phase-3-human-trials,2,Went for a team-building event and had a great time. Huy was our host and he was very helpful. We did the Human Trials and didn't make it out but had a great time. Huy did a great job explaining what we needed to do to get out once we were done.
