"Escape room ""Murder Mystery"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-murder-mystery,0,I did the murder mystery Room a couple weeks ago and it was the bomb. I've also completed the zombie apocalypse Quest paranoia Quest and a couple rooms at Breakout. So far paranoia Quest has by far been my favorite. Right now they have a great special going that makes them comprable to other vendors comma and you get a lot in the rooms at paranoia Quest more challenges more tasks and you also get a little good even if you don't complete it. Highly rated gotta try it out.

I loved how me and my friend were paired up with different people, it brought us all together even though we just met each other 5 minutes before. I can't wait go back!"
"Escape room ""Murder Mystery"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-murder-mystery,2,"I truly enjoyed my experience! It was challenging and right up my alley. I purchased a Groupon for four for the Zombie room. We were paired with four others. I think it was a little too crowded. 8 people seems like enough. I told staff it was my boyfriend birthday at the time of booking and they made it a point to wish him a happy birthday and make him out ""leader"". I was really nice of them. I suggest you arrived 5-10 mins early, the game starts at your booked time. Parking was easy to get to. Staff was friendly. I will be returning. I will stay alive next time!! "
"Escape room ""Murder Mystery"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-murder-mystery,3,Loved this room. Definitely wasn't easy but I love a good challenge. The staff is super friendly. The location makes it pretty easy to find. I loved the way the room was set up...all the different clues I'll stop before I say to much. If you haven't already definitely try this room out!

Though we didn't make it out the room (insert sad face) we had a great time and still talking about it in the office. In fact a few other depts heard how much fun we had and are looking to take the challenge as well as one of our company principals is looking to book a room for her family. Looking forward to trying the other rooms soon!"
"Escape room ""Murder Mystery"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-murder-mystery,5,We had a great time! We didn't make it all the way thru but we are so excited to go back! You really have to use your brain! Great team building exercise!
"Escape room ""Murder Mystery"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-murder-mystery,6,"Great time! guidelines given at the beginning were too fast though Now I understand what to expect and what not to do. It was hard having NO clue the first time through (for example, the fact that we had to backtrack we never realized that was an option)."
