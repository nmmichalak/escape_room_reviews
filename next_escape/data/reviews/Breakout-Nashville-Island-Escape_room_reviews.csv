"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/Breakout-Nashville-Island-Escape,2,"We had a blast! It was super fun and well worth the money. We had three adults and three children (two aged 9 and one aged 10). We all worked together as a team and were able to escape with 5 minutes left on the clock. What a great way to have good, clean, quality gun with your friends and family! Would definitely do it again!Oh... And btw... The staff was wonderfully AWESOME! ‚ù§"

It was a lot of fun and we really enjoyed it. It was quite hot in the room, that would be my only complaint. The staff was fabulous. I totally recommend it. And we broke out with almost 11 mins to spare!"

Our entrance in the room started right on time, the rules were explained very clearly, and our ""Game Master"" was great! She was very helpful during the entire game, not necessarily giving anything away, or making us use one of our 3 clues, but pointing us in the right direction to move to the next step. The puzzles were challenging and really made you think, but weren't so hard that you couldn't solve. We had three 14 yr olds and 3 adults and just missed finishing by about a minute and a half! The Kidnapping room was exciting, and you really start to feel like you have to hurry before the kidnapper comes back. If you are looking for an escape game company, Breakout is one to try! They were friendly, didn't have any wait, clean, fun rooms with props in good condition. If you also don't want the hassle of downtown Nashville, I highly recommend coming to Breakout in Franklin!! We will be back again to try and ""Breakout!!"""
