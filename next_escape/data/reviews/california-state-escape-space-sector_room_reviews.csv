The room had some pretty interactive puzzles and the props were perfect. Can't wait to try Crematory next!"

"Escape room ""Space Sector"" by California State Escape in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/california-state-escape-space-sector,2,We had so much fun today escaping our room!

"Escape room ""Space Sector"" by California State Escape in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/california-state-escape-space-sector,3,"I’ve been here twice and have enjoyed both times! I did The Crematory first and Space Sector second. Space Sector was easier, in my opinion, and I was with only 4 other people in my group. We passed it with just seconds left which was really exciting! The rooms were super fun and would recommend Space Sector if it’s your very first time doing an escape room and don’t really know what to expect. What I love most about this place is how nice and friendly the owners are. They’re super chill and will make you want to go back! Definitely go here if you’re looking for something exciting to do."
