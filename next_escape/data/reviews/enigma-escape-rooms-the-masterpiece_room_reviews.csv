We did not make it in time but thoroughly enjoyed the hour and felt very challenged and entertained! This was a high quality, well done escape room! We definitely want to return again and try the other room. Thanks for a great time!"

We had a great time with our family of 2 kids and 2 adults. They clearly put a lot of effort into creating a quality experience.

Is the best hour you can possibly spend in the city. The staff was helpful and kind. The room was very challenging but I would definitely do it again.
