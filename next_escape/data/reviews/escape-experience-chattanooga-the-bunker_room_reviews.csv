"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Experience Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/escape-experience-chattanooga-the-bunker,1,I did the bunker with one other person. We did not make it out because there are just too many puzzles for two people. This was a really great experience. The bunker feels real and they did a really great job with this room. I would recommend a minimum of 4 players for this room. It is big enough to fit 8 easily.
