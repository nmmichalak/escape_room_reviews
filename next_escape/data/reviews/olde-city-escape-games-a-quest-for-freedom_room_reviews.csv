"Escape room ""A Quest for Freedom"" by Olde City Escape Games in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/olde-city-escape-games-a-quest-for-freedom,0,"My favorite escape room in Philadelphia. This escape room cleverly uses a 150+ year old building to create the most immersive ambiance I've played in a long time. With over 50 games under my belt, this room ranks up near the top of my list because the story-driven puzzles that lead to a satisfying ""wow-moment"" ending. The decor took my breath away. There was a moment where I just wanted to stop playing the game and just examine the antiques. If you're a scenery snob, this game is for you. It's perfect for group of small enthusiasts, or a larger group of newer players. Either way, with unlimited hints, and thoughtful game mastering from Brooks where he really gives anything away, but allows you to enjoy those Ah-Ha moments by nudging you in the right direction, this room has such great flow, I will never forget it. We will be talking about for days, months, years. Highly recommended for corporate team building because of the HR-friendly content, unlike some of the other escape rooms in the area that are rate R (or worse) and wouldn't be appropriate for work-related events."

It was the perfect way to end the day. Not to challenging for the kids and not too easy for the adults. Everyone had fun. Thank you!"

We did the Freedom Quest room, and ended up just the 3 of us. The clues were the right level of challenging for the grown ups, and our little loved the effects of doors being opened and clues revealed. The hints were useful without feeling like you were cheating, and we solved it with seconds left. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend!"

Went with a large group of friends of varying escape room experiences, and we all had a blast. Looking forward to trying out the other room. Would highly recommend!"
