"Escape room ""Containment"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-containment,0,"I tried the Containment room with my four children, aged 15-22. This set-up was more creepy than other ones we have chosen in the past, and it would be a little much for people who have certain phobias. There are a lot of puzzles that need to be solved in this one... we waited a little too late in the game to start taking our clues and did not get out in time, but we had a lot of fun!"

We did Containment with 4 ppl. So much fun even if you ""die"". We were so close! Great puzzles and really gets your mind thinking. The staff is excellent as well! Can't wait to come back to try the others!"

We haven't done an escape room so this was our first experience and we will definitely do another next time we come. Containment was just the right amount of creepy and fun! Crystal was very helpful and super nice, she made it extra fun for us, we loved her!"

We went in not knowing what to expect since it is in the mall, but it was just as good as, if not better than, many of the escape rooms we have done. If you like mild scares, containment is a great room. We are going back next week and doing the museum heist!"
