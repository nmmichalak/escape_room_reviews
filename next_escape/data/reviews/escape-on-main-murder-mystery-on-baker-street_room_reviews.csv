"Escape room ""Murder Mystery on Baker Street"" by Escape on Main in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-on-main-murder-mystery-on-baker-street,0,"We had family visiting for Christmas so my wife and I scheduled an Escape On Main Baker Street Mystery. We had my wife and I, my brother and his wife and their two twenty-somethings. Before starting, we were told that every successful group had requested at least two clues. There are some leaps of logic that absolutely require a clue so do not hesitate to ask for a few clues! We escaped with 20 seconds to spare and it was great fun!"

We did the Baker Street Mystery and it was a blast. Tons to do. We were a team of 4, and I feel that was ideal. I think 8 would be way to much, so I would recommend buying the room out. Wish we were in the area longer to do the casino one."
