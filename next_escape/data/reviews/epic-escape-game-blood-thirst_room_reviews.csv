While we had a ton of fun and completed over 60%, we were constrained by the linear progressive design. It was well designed. Great times."

Bloodthirst was definitely challenging (we probably should have started with an easier room) but the puzzles were well thought out and very satisfying when we were able to solve them.The staff was friendly and the experience was great overall even though we failed in our mission! We will definitely be back to attempt some of the other rooms. Thanks for a great time."

Though we lost Blood Thirst, we had a great time. Kicking ourselves for not listening to our gut about asking for the 1st clue early on, but we did not have a whole group vote on it since our foursome was paired up with another foursome & they did not want it. We almost made it! Ugh! Definitely a return in the works for another room! Staff was super friendly and helpful! Go here, peeps! "

It really is very challenging because it is not intuitive, the game had far too many steps, which were hard to follow. More people do not help because the game stops completely at points while you figure out one particular step. Good luck to any who dare to try it!"
