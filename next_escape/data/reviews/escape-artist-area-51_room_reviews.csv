"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Artist in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-artist-area-51,0,My 12-year-old granddaughter and I had a great time in the Area 51 room! The staff was great and the short orientation/video was perfect (and a little creepy) leading up to the fun. We will be back!

They were in Area 51, and had a blast trying to find the clues. The staff was super helpful and polite. I loved that we could watch on a camera in another room and hear what they were saying. I'd love to try it myself!"

So much fun for the entire family and we plan to go back to do more rooms! Already planning the next night out! We did Area 51 and it was difficult but we made it out in under 60 mins. Staff was great and very friendly!
