"Escape room ""Jewel Thief"" by beat60 in Gadsden",https://worldofescapes.com/gadsden/quests/beat60-jewel-thief,0,"We absolutely loved our experience here! We had booked The Captain, and loved it so much we stayed and did The Jewel Thief! Honestly, if we had the time that day, we probably would have gone ahead and done The Darkness! It's a great addition to the Gadsden area. Thank you so much for bringing this experience to Gadsden!"
"Escape room ""Jewel Thief"" by beat60 in Gadsden",https://worldofescapes.com/gadsden/quests/beat60-jewel-thief,1,Had a great time with the kids trying to solve The Jewel and The Captain. These games are well designed and so entertaining! The Captain is very challenging! Definitely need your thinking cap on this one! Highly recommend Beat 60!!
