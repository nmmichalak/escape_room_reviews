"Escape room ""Alcatraz"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-alcatraz,0,"My husband, kids, and myself went this evening and had so much fun. We did Alcatraz; we didn't get out in time but we were pretty close. I love the use of technology and the way the puzzles were set-up. Still very challenging.It was really important to us that our youngest was able to participate in a quality escape room. The staff was super polite and informative in how everything works. The facility is clean and well taken care of. Thank you for a great time tonight."

We were all first timers and chose the ""Alcatraz"" themed room which was the second hardest room, according to our guide Taylour.She was so sweet and Informative, guiding us along when we needed help and cheering us on along the way. Thank you Tay!Be prepared to stare blankly at walls, think everything in front of you is a clue, and become completely immersed into a world where escaping is the goal."

So far we've done 3 different rooms at this location and they were all amazing. Alcatraz required some next level communication that we haven't experienced in other rooms, Down the Rabbit Hole was one of the more challenging rooms we've been in, and Machina had a great theme with some nice technology involved in it.We had Acel and Nadine as our game masters and they were great. They explained everything clearly, were very helpful when needed, and made the overall experience amazing. Can't wait to go back and finish the rest of the rooms!"

By far the best-organized place I've been to as far as escape room businesses. We did Alcatraz with a group of four. The props were great, smart puzzles, nice staff. Great price, clean and well-organized. Super happy, can't wait to go back and try other rooms."

I'm certain if my partners weren't there, I'd still be stuck in that room! Ha! Great puzzles to solve and fun to work your way through it. The room is decorated authentically - so you feel like you're in jail. You get one hour and they offer clues if you need them. I can't wait to go back and test out my skills on the other rooms."
