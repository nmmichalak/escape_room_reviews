"Escape room ""Prohibition Ransom"" by Boss-Play Escape Rooms in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/boss-play-escape-rooms-prohibition-ransom,0,"I had not been to any Escape Rooms prior to this one, and had no idea what to expect. The theme was fun and the room fit the theme very well. The puzzles were challenging but do-able with the ""right"" people! I was impressed with how the puzzles worked and the electronics of the room. Super fun and we are already looking forward to when Boss-Play has a 2nd room."
"Escape room ""Prohibition Ransom"" by Boss-Play Escape Rooms in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/boss-play-escape-rooms-prohibition-ransom,1,"Went here in a group of 4 and was blown away by the quality of the entire experience. So many puzzles, all of which make perfect sense with the theme.You will be immersed in the situation as you race to beat the clock. My team did succeed although we had a few challenges that almost beat us.Foe the price there is really no better entertainment. Way better than seeing a movie as my friends spent the rest of the day talking about the experience."
"Escape room ""Prohibition Ransom"" by Boss-Play Escape Rooms in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/boss-play-escape-rooms-prohibition-ransom,2,"My friends and I had a blast escaping the room from Boss Play! We went a couple of weeks ago and were all really impressed with the quality of the room. I had done one other ""escape room"" before at a different company but was very disappointed that it was just a boring room with random puzzles scattered about. Boss Play's room actually felt like a real room we had to escape with thoughtful puzzles that fit the theme. There were also a few surprises that blew my mind when we discovered them. I would highly recommend choosing Boss Play if you ever want to do an escape room."
