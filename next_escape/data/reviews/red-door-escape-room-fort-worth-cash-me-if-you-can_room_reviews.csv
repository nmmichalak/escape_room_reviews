"Escape room ""Cash Me if You Can"" by Red Door Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-fort-worth-cash-me-if-you-can,1,"Came in with my girlfriend and some of her co-workers in January to play Cash Me If You Can. Not my first escape room, but first time at Red Door. This particular room had us split into 2 groups and required us to not only escape the room within 60 minutes, but to compete with our other group to see who could collect the most poker chips.This was a unique experience as far as escape rooms go, we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff was mindful, patient and helpful and enjoyed to have us in the location. You can tell this place is managed well. We will be back this summer!"
