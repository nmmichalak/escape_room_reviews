It was difficult enough but they were able to work through the clues together. Surprisingly a lot more fun than was expected!

At first, I was a little concerned with how the dynamics of working with strangers would go, but we fell into a teamwork rhythm right away. Really entertaining puzzles (Watson’s Revenge) helpful staff and happy atmosphere. We’ll be back!"

It was truly a challenge where you have to work together and we did! We had 10 people and everyone had an amazing time. PJ was a pleasure to work with and I highly recommend doing this with your teams. I am talking with my family about doing a family night here!"

We chose Watson's Revenge for what was most of our group's first escape room experience. The theme was carried through the room well, and there was a fun variety of puzzles and challenges, plus some neat, unique effects. This is definitely a great room for first-timers, and the staff is helpful and friendly. Our group had a great time, and we hope to return soon to tackle the other room!"
