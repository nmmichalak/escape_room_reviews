"Escape room ""Dragon Tower"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-dragon-tower,0,We had such an amazing time doing the escape room. These people are so innovative and have created such a cool experience. Seriously. Wow. I can't wait to go back and try the next room!
"Escape room ""Dragon Tower"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-dragon-tower,1,"Dragon tower Origin. Oh my god. It's so hard. Extra extra teamwork needed. This is probably the hardest escape room I've ever done. Everyone will do something to contribute to the escape. Everyone are locked in different rooms with different puzzles, but you're not the key to your room..you'll need your kins. Sooo many puzzles (A LOT) and technology. 6186382 hints needed (mirror mirror on the wall PLEASE HELP US). We have to add extra time (30minutes) to get out lol. Have to pay for the extra time though. If you want to challenge yourself and your teammate I recommend this place. Love the costumes and the production value. And the weapons! Use them! Game master is amazing. Thank you, you're our savior.One tip..escape :)!By the way, they got restroom now!"

Definitely takes teamwork and paying attention to detail!  Asking for clues was easier and more clear than other rooms.  Wayne (the owner) was a great game master. You do start separated, but thankfully not for long.  I recommend checking out this room!"
