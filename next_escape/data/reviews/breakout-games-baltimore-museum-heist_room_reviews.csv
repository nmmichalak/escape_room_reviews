"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-museum-heist,0,"I received this as a surprise birthday gift last night from my fiance. It was quite the experience, we had a great time and we beat it. We did the heist room with 8 people. Didn't quite know what to expect but our game Tech Kim was quite helpful with her explanation of what we were up against. All in all it was a blast, and was the topic of conversation for the next 5 hours... We will see you soon!!!"

This experience was really fun! The employees here was above and beyond excellent customer service. I never felt bad about paying almost $30 for this. It was well worth spent for the perfect experience.So me and my group did Museum Heist and I want to be honest, this isn't the best one to do if this is your group first time doing it. It was fun but it was a lot. We had to ask our Host for plenty of clues. He was nice tho.I want to do this again. I want to do them all actually because that's just how much fun this was."

The Museum Heist room was awesome and had some amazing puzzles. It's a great place to bring friends, family, or co-workers. I'll be back to try the other rooms!"

The puzzles and clues were challenging but doable and fun. Best of all, our 2-person team successfully broke out with a few minutes to spare! Thanks for a great time, Breakout Games!"

Thanks to the whole staff, we had a great time and will definitely come back and try another room!"
