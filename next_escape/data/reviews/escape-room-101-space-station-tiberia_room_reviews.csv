"Escape room ""Space Station Tiberia VR"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-space-station-tiberia,0,"This was a lot of fun to do virtual escape. The staff was a lot of help and the effects are great. Some people may be a little freaked out at looking down on the world from space, but I found it awesome."
"Escape room ""Space Station Tiberia VR"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-space-station-tiberia,1,"I went back and tried the VR room, the space room. Absolutely incredible. I have done VR before, oculus and Samsung vr, but not like this where you can walk around and see the other people in your group. If you have never tried it, you definitely need to. VR is so futuristic and needs to be supported.The space escape room itself want too hard... It honestly seemed like it was designed for kids. However it was just plain fun! You can pick things up and throw them around the space station, which just doesn't seem to get old. Escaping the room was almost secondary to the fun space elements.We got out pretty quick and they were nice enough to let us see the horror hospital VR walk through, which was... Interesting.Anyway, based on others reviews here for the physical escape rooms, try them at your own risk. But the VR rooms just seem plain fun."
