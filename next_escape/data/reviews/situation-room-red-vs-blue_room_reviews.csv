"Escape room ""Red vs Blue"" by Situation Room in Macon",https://worldofescapes.com/macon/quests/situation-room-red-vs-blue,0,Had such a fun time we did another room the same day.
"Escape room ""Red vs Blue"" by Situation Room in Macon",https://worldofescapes.com/macon/quests/situation-room-red-vs-blue,1,Went for a group activity. This was my first escape room experience. Our helper was very nice and gave us clues but didn't give it away. We did Red vs Blue and it was hard! It wasn't so hard that it wasn't fun but we didn't finish in time. We definitely needed to work together. We were soooo close but fell short. I still had a great time and would do it again. The restroom was clean and I parked in the garage. Staff was super friendly and the rules were explained well.

Our group, which consisted of 4 adults and 6 kids (ages 8 to 17) tried Red vs Blue. We didn't end up escaping, but everyone was able to contribute in some way and we all had fun. I would definitely recommend it!"

We didn't make it out in time but came very close. Everyone had a blast! It was more impressive than I thought it would be, and I would highly recommend it to anyone! Can't wait to try out Stellar."
