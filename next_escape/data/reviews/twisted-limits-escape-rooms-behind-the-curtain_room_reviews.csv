"Escape room ""Behind The Curtain"" by Twisted Limits Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/twisted-limits-escape-rooms-behind-the-curtain,0,Awesome!! We will visit again! We did the Behind the Curtain Room. We had both kids and adults. Great experience! We didn't make it out in time but will try again! Great customer service! This was our first experience in an escape room and it didn't disappoint!

Went as a group of 8 for Behing the Curtian and everyone was able to participate. We will definitely be back to take on Executive Disorder and eventually, the Omega Hour!"

We knew it would be a challenge with just the two of us, but we enjoy escape rooms, win or lose, so we gave it a go. We did an epically bad job, but the gamemaster/host Joe was extremely nice about it, injecting humor and help the whole time, so we still had a great time. It was a solid, challenging room with unique puzzles, and we look forward to their next room. Thanks for a fun Saturday night, Twisted Limits!"
