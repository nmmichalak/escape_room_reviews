"Escape room ""The Haunted Tomb"" by Portal Escape Rooms in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/portal-escape-rooms-the-tomb-of-the-gods,0,"We almost finished Tomb of the Gods last Saturday. This place is awesome and we had a blast. The rooms were cleverly put together, and the two brothers running it were fantastic. Good storyline, challenging, and flawlessly mysterious. Will be back!"
"Escape room ""The Haunted Tomb"" by Portal Escape Rooms in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/portal-escape-rooms-the-tomb-of-the-gods,1,We did The Tomb of the Gods adventure this evening and loved it! There were eight of us and that was a perfect sized group. We're looking forward to doing the rest of the rooms!
"Escape room ""The Haunted Tomb"" by Portal Escape Rooms in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/portal-escape-rooms-the-tomb-of-the-gods,2,"This was hands down the best escape room I’ve done. We completed the Temple of the Gods and it was a complete visual and auditory experience, unlike many escape rooms where you’re just in one small room with a few cheesy decorations. I really felt like I was really in a jungle temple! These guys have gone above and beyond to create an experience that feels real. Everything in the room is high tech and automated. These brothers created the sound scapes and designed all of the autimation and puzzles themselves. They even designed the interior and clues to be replicas of real ancient Aztec artifacts. I’m telling you, go to portlal escape rooms...you will not be disappointed! In fact, your mind will be blown!"
