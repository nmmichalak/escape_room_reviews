I highly recommend it, make sure you go w/ friends."
"Escape room ""Immersive Adventure VR"" by Virtual Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virtual-room-immersive-adventure,1,This place is an absolute gem. Been twice with friends and once with my son. Everyone was blown away at the fun. Great staff and easy to find location in Hollywood.  The games are complex enough to play multiple times yet simple enough to grasp quickly.  The first time was sensory overload in a good way. Need to get back and try the new modules.

Canâ€™t wait to do it again!!!"
