Save the Fleet was an awesome hook game. The fort game was my favorite game, the puzzles were a bit more involved and the final scene was something else!"

We did the Fort room. Historical as well as entertaining story/puzzle. Was difficult but we escaped! Blake was the best, his enthusiasm and knowledge set the tone for our experience. Would recommend this for anyone looking for something to do in St. Aug/Jax area."

We did the Castillo De Matanzas and enjoyed every minute of the puzzle. The tasks were very challenging but after some teamwork, we were able to complete the room. Definitely a must of you are in St. Augustine!"
