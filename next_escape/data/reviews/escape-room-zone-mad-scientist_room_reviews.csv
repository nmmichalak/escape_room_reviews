We found it to be very challenging yet solvable and fun, provoking team work during the process. The staff is great! Kyle and Javon were very helpful and gave subtle clues. I will definitely be returning to try the rest of the rooms!"

I would highly recommend giving it a try! So much fun and more difficult and well put together than I thought it would be! A special thanks to Sean for handling our booking! Can't wait to go back!
