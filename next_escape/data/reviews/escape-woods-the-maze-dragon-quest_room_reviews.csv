"Escape room ""The Maze: Dragon Quest"" by Escape Woods in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-woods-the-maze-dragon-quest,0,We had a great time doing the Amazing Dragon maze escape. It was cold and rainy but they still let us do it. It was a lot of fun. We will come back to try the other rooms.

We did the dragon quest maze. It was really challenging, even for us escape room veterans! Its just so different being outside and having so much more stuff to work with. We had a couple issues, like there was something above us we had to grab that we couldnt reach, but the woman in charge was really helpful. We didn't quite manage to win but we came really close! We had such a blast!!"
