"Escape room ""Alien Encounter"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-alien-encounter,0,"Alien Encounter is the only game that I played at Clue Chase, but I have played many other escape games before. This room was one of the largest I've ever been in. The hint system is really unique and the puzzles are definitely imaginative and tech forward. My biggest problem with the room was that the clues were sometimes really vague and the game flow was almost all linear. So while the room can physically fit 12 people, there aren't enough simultaneous activities to keep that many people engaged. It's probably best with a total of 4-6 players."

"Escape room ""Alien Encounter"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-alien-encounter,4,Awesome time! Five of us went and it seemed like a good number to solve the mystery with out too many arguments.  The Alien room is supposed to be the most difficult and it humbled us. Great event space for a group of friends.
"Escape room ""Alien Encounter"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-alien-encounter,5,Terrific experience trying to communicate with aliens at Clue Chase. I play lots of games when I travel and this game was top notch. I also play a lot of games solo and the team at Clue Chase went out of their way to let me experience this larger room on my own on my one day in NYC. Great customer service - all done in character as well. The staff helped me with all the puzzles that required more than one person despite being busy with other customers.The room itself was very innovative with significant tecn and gadgets and very little of the traditional open many locks of standard rooms. The theme was excellent and the room looked great. Definitely worth checking out - be ready for some cool tech and bring your A game!
