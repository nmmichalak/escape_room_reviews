Imagine Escape Games is the place to be! We did all three rooms in a row and truly enjoyed every detail. Challenging but not impossible.

The design  was seamless and the puZale were challenging but not impossible. Our team of four had two advanced players(70+ games), I am a novice(about 20 games) and we had a n00b(2nd game), yet the puzzles challenged all of us pretty equally. Loved the theme and execution . They are in a great location, I will be back to play another room very soon."
"Escape room ""reSEArch"" by Breakout's Imagine Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/imagine-escape-games-research,4,"My wife and I were privileged to be part of a beta test group for the newest room ReSEArch. This was not our first experience, and Imagine Escape Games blew the competition away! We were joined by a family of 5 (ages 10+) for a 7-person group. For a game still in the testing phase, the puzzles were clever and flowed flawlessly in almost every respect. I want to tell you more about some of the awesome stuff they have in there, but I don't want to spoil the experience. Find out for yourself! Having a seven-person group really helped, as we were able to work as a team to divide the puzzles and solve them as efficiently as possible, bringing us to escape with 15 minutes to spare. Beat that! :)"
