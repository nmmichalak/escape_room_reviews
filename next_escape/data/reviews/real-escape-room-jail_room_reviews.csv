I was suprised such a small space could hold such a great game. I have been to the one in San Jose before as well. Came here with a group of friends and we all had a blast. I don't want to give any details away but we all had a great time and want to do another one some time soon!The jail one was a great storyline, and the employees were helpful at times and very committed to staying in character.
