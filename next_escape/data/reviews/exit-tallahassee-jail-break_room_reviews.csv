"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by EXIT Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/exit-tallahassee-jail-break,0,We did the jail break room and got out with 2.5 minutes to spare. It was so much fun and more challenging than I thought it would be. Can't wait to go back and do the other room!
"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by EXIT Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/exit-tallahassee-jail-break,1,"I LOVE this place, the owner is so sweet and really appreciates feedback about how to make the rooms better but unfortunately I didn't have anything to tell her because they were perfect! I did the 407 room a few weeks ago and the Jail break one today and both were very intellectually challenging unlike most rooms I've been to across the country. I loved how realistic everything was and how helpful the staff was, I can't wait to come back when the new room comes out."
