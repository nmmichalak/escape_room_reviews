"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Newport News in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/breakout-games-newport-news-the-kidnapping,0,"Honestly best experience ever! My friends and I took on ""The Kidnapping"". A huge thank you to Matt, our Master of Games for being so patient with us and cheering us on. I've previously tried escape room down on South Beach and I do have to say this experience surpassed it by far. Though we didn't make it, we were close and I'll hold on to that as a win. Thank you!"

We did the kidnapping room and had a blast! We were nervous qt first about being handcuffed and blindfolded but the amazing staff made it easy and fun. We seriously recommend this for families or friends! We almost made it out! So close!

It is a lot harder then I would of imagined, however that's what made it so much fun. I can't wait to go again and attempt a different room. The staff was amazing. Noah was an awesome host. I loved hearing his voice come from the Heavens lol"

We had to wait a little bit before our game started but they had riddles for us until it was our time. Kidnapping was very exciting and we had a great time with that game. Can't wait to get everyone together to go again. By far the best escape room we have been to!"
