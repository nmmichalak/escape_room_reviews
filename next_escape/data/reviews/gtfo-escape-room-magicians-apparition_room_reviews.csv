"Escape room ""Magician's Apparition"" by GTFO Escape Room in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/gtfo-escape-room-magicians-apparition,1,"We had a blast in the Magician Apparition escape room! We went in overtime since it was just the two of us and the little one but we got out!!! The team was fantastic and offered hints when we were stuck! The room had a ton of puzzles to complete and definitely made you think, problem solve, and have to work together! This is a great activity for a bonding, family, friends, and team building experience! I highly recommend GTFO! Put down the video games and phones and go check this place out; it is more than worth the time and money! All custom unique rooms, a fantastic atmosphere, and so much to do in a single room!"
