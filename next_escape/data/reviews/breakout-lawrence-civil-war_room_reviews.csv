"Escape room ""Civil War"" by Breakout Lawrence in Lawrence",https://worldofescapes.com/lawrence/quests/breakout-lawrence-civil-war,0,"This was my first experience with an escape room, and it was beyond my expectations! First of all, the staff is incredible (looking at you Carrie), they are seriously half the fun! And the room? Wow. Do the Civil War Room - it will blow your mind! If you’re looking for an hour to kill and want to have a great time with friends - this is where it’s at. We did this with 3 people and the only part I’m bummed about is not being able to do it again with all of my friends!"

Breakout Lawrence has some of the best rooms that I have done, and ""Civil War"" is probably my favorite room yet. ""Basketball"" was very good too. I definitely want to do the other rooms. Great rooms, great staff, great fun."
