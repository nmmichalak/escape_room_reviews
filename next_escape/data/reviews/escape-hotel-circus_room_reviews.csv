"Escape room ""Circus"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-circus,0,"First experience with an escape room. My group did the ""Circus"" theme. From the second you walk in the door, this place is a 5 star. The ambiance is top notch. The decor is fantastic! The staff is very engaging and in costume. They seem to really enjoy what they do. The room itself was awesome! My group of 6 failed to beat it. Very challenging and incredibly fun. We can't wait to come back and try another room."

This place really does a great job and gives you a good bang for your buck. I loved it as soon as I walked in. The way everything is decorated, you're immediately in the ""zone"". I don't want to say too much and give anything away. Just grab some friends and do it!"

I hadn't expected to a) be allowed to attempt a room solo or b) there to be any rooms available when I was there. Sure enough, I could and there was. So, since I was there and was offered a discount by Danny, I took advantage. Sadly, I could not escape Carnival. If I ever get back to LA from the East Coast, I'm coming back for revenge! Decor and costuming was beautiful."
