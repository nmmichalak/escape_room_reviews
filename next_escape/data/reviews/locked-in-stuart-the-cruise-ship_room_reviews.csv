"Escape room ""The Cruise Ship"" by Locked In Stuart in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/locked-in-stuart-the-cruise-ship,0,Escaped the cruise room. Had 8 people. May have been a few too many when we realized the clues were sequential. Had a great time though. Would prefer if the staff did not come in the room to give clues. Over the intercom much more preferred!
"Escape room ""The Cruise Ship"" by Locked In Stuart in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/locked-in-stuart-the-cruise-ship,1,Had a great time. Did the CRUISE room. One of the things you need to do is very finicky. Won't give it away but we were doing for easily 5 min before employee came in and did something to get us next clue. They probably need to adjust it. All I'll say is you need a steady hand!
