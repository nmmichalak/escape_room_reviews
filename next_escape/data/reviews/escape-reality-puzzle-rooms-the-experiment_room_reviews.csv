"Escape room ""The Gridlock"" by Escape Reality Puzzle Rooms in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/escape-reality-puzzle-rooms-the-experiment,0,This place is an awesome thing to have in the Latrobe area. I came here once last year and did the Discovery. And today we returned to do the Gridlock. The rooms are well crafted and done so it makes it seem like your actually somewhere part of the story. The puzzles are very challenging and make you think very hard. All and all itâ€™s a fun time and I will definitely be back when the next new room opens up. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time with a group of friends or as a family.
