"Escape room ""Poe-Ranormal Activity"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-poe-ranormal-activity,0,"The room we had was the Poe-ranormal room. The decor and ambience is superb and immersing from the moment you walk in. Everything you see is meticulously designed to transport you to their world.Almost every puzzle made perfect sense, and the ones we didn't get, our host helped us with clues. Some of the puzzles are pretty hi tech which was great too.Our host was very friendly and stuck to the story very well. He was attentive as we made our way through the puzzles and his hints were crucial to us solving the room in time (with literally one second to spare).When we finished,  they had this really cool area with props and costumes where we could dress up and take pictures to remember this event by.We had a great time and will definitely go back and take friends when we do."

Yay! We went here to celebrate a birthday and had such a good time! Fun puzzles and amazing art design. Loved the challenging activities and teamwork! Very cool using these skills to work together to solve a problem without seeming too gimicky or lame. Would definitely go again. The host did a good job of setting the mood. We had the Poe room. I will not divulge anymore because I do not want to spoil your puzzles; so just go!!!!"
"Escape room ""Poe-Ranormal Activity"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-poe-ranormal-activity,2,"I went with a group of friends and we completed the Poe-ranormal room. Most of us had never done an escape room before and had no idea what to expect. We had a blast! The room was challenging and a ton of fun. Our room host explained the rules and chimed in with an occasional clarification via walkie-talkie as we bumbled our way through the clues and red herrings. We managed to get out with 9 minutes to spare. From the decor to the layout of the venue, they do a great job of setting the scene and getting guests into the mood while you wait for your challenge to begin. It was an utterly enjoyable event, from beginning to end."

We were in the Poe-anormal Activity Room, which is one of the more advanced rooms. The 45 minutes flew by as my girlfriend and I were in one part of the room solving various puzzles, and the family that was in our group was in the main room. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience! Hannah was an awesome guide / host! We will certainly try some of the other rooms soon!"
