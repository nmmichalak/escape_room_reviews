"Escape room ""Mystery of Dr. Frankenstein"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-mystery-of-dr-frankenstein,0,"One of the most beautiful escape rooms I've ever done! Various puzzles, cool hints (the mad doctor's voice was awesome!), and a wonderful Victorian Steampunk atmosphere. The room is really well made: the attention to the details is amazing. There was a puzzle I'd never seen before. I loved it and higly recommend it. "
