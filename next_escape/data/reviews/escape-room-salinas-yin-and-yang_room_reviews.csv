We enjoyed it so much that we went back the same day to try another room. Really fun and great way to work as a team. The owner was friendly and I would recommend this place for any occasion or just something to do. Even if youâ€™re not really a puzzle person this is still a lot of fun. We will be back to play again soon. ðŸ˜Š"
