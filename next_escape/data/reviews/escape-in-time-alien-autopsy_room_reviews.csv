"Escape room ""Alien Autopsy"" by Escape In Time in Madison",https://worldofescapes.com/madison/quests/escape-in-time-alien-autopsy,0,"I was a little disappointed in this room. Logistically, the room was just too small for the 6 of us to move around. Game construction-wise the second phase was just figuring out a bunch of numerical codes. The first part of the puzzle was at least science-y. The final step could only be solved by 1, maybe 2, people, and the rest of us had to just stand around for 15 minutes. Worth the experience, just wish it had been developed further. "

We had fun.  I'd recommend it.  In retrospect we should have reserved the entire room for our party, but we had a lot of fun and we escaped with 35 seconds left."

There were 10 of us and we did the Alien Autopsy. Although we failed (on the very last part), we were soooo close! Can't wait to try out the other rooms."

The entire experience was very well done with incredible attention to detail that made it feel remarkably realistic. It was definitely a hit with the boys, and I'd love to try one with adults another time."
