The clues were challenging and fun to try and decipher. The room had a fun creepy feel with cool props and effects. I can't give away any secrets, but I jumped pretty good with one of them! Haha! So fun! Can't wait to try all of the rooms. The staff there were so fun and friendly and really cared whether we had a great evening as well. Overall, this is THE place to go!"
