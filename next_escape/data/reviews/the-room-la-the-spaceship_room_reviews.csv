"Escape room ""The Spaceship"" by The Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-room-la-the-spaceship,1,WOW! Had the BEST time! Our first experience in an escape room and it was even more fun than we expected! We did the Spaceship experience and will be going back soon to do the Cabin.
"Escape room ""The Spaceship"" by The Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-room-la-the-spaceship,2,We had one hour to get out of a space module. Had to decipher many clues and riddles manually and electronically. Our family plus 2 got out with about 40 seconds to spare. We found life on planet Zoe and lived to tell about it! Easier to open locks would improve rating.

The storytelling was a little bit confusing though (hard to figure out what exactly the point of each puzzle was) and some of the props were really challenging to work with which cut into our time. But overall it was very fun, the woman who worked with us was so nice and professional and helpful, and we had a great time! And we escaped with 3 minutes to spare!"
