"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Clever Fox in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/clever-fox-outbreak,0,"We did the ""Outbreak"" room first. Great escape room for beginner-novice level groups. This room was a lot of fun, staff was great (Ed and his daughter), set design was great, puzzles were some-what challenging and went with the storyline. I would definitely recommend Outbreak for someone just starting out with escape rooms. More recently we did ""Forbidden Temple"" which was a little more our speed. Again the room was a blast, the staff was great (had the other owners this time around, Tom and Jennie), set design was beautiful and the puzzles were a little more challenging but went great with the story. Can't wait for them to open another room for us to try out."

The staff was very nice and accommodating--I ended up over booking by one person and they refunded me with no hassle. They provide lockers for your belongings and no phones allowed. The room is so cool...great attention to detail and ""studio effects"". I've been to a few other escape rooms in the Murrieta/Temecula area and this place is HANDS DOWN the best designed! It was so challenging and fun. I went with my teenage kids and nephew and they enjoyed it as well. It's a local small business and I highly recommend that you give them your support."

We had some good conversations with Tom Fox and a great experience in the game itself. Fun puzzles and good concept. If we had time to come back for the Lost Temple we definitely would! Hey Tom, if you need two more for Hex in Anaheim hit us up!"
