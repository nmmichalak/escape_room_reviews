"Escape room ""The Secret Chamber"" by 8D Room Escape & Board Games in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/8d-room-escape-the-secret-chamber,0,"We tried the Egyptian room and it was a challenge! Having been to many escape rooms, this one really proved to innovative, challenging, engaging and to be honest, really cerebral. The production value was awesome and I really liked that it was not too easy.The staff could not have been more friendly, patient and helpful. They also have a small meeting room and a plethora of puzzles and board games in the main entrance area. It was a great place to be before and after our reservation."

The puzzles are challenging and fun. Best experience I would suggest is 6-8 people. Besides, board games are included in the tickets. We had a great time there."

I did both themes they have in one afternoon with my friend. The Secret Chamber has lots of special effects. All puzzles are doable and interesting. Employees are very nice, especially Andrew. He selected board games for us, which were free since we've played the escape room, and taught us how to play. I will definitely ask my friends to come and be locked."
