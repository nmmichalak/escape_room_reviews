"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,0,This room had the perfect flow and was heavy puzzle-based. Soundtrack was awesome and as you progress through the room it just gets better and better. The last part was probably the best thing ever. It starts off with an FBI kind of vibe and turns into a detective like situation and then you walk into a scary movie right after that. The game master Curtis will give you candy!

The puzzles were hard but solvable. Not crazy scary but quite macabre which was great. Strongly recommended!!"
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,2,"These rooms are the real deal! Strongly recommended! The Culver City branch let my fiancee and I play their new ""Jack the Ripper"" room early, and good golly, it was amazing. A wide variety of clever puzzles that are integrated with a full, 3-Act narrative. No puzzles exist ""Just because"". They are all either literally riddles/challenges Jack left behind or direct metaphors for the investigative process. Not only are the puzzles thematically enthralling, they are entirely challenging and creative. Each of them is very different than the others while also containing different thought processes. Some are riddles that require abstract thought, whereas another puzzle may be a straight-forward scavenger hunt that requires a keen eye, curiosity, and thorough investigation. My fiancee and I work together well but also have very different thought processes. To this end, it felt entirely rewarding to split up and apply this, with my interpreting coded messages and her noticing the clues and items I would have never caught onto. So rewarding!As well, the room's hosts are beyond kind and generous. We were provided a walkie talkie that was intended to be used for a limited amount of clues, as well as emergencies.  I can't say enough nice things about this room. It's the real deal. Rooms like this are textbook examples of why Escape Rooms are big and what a unique experience they can provide.Please go try it as soon as you can!"
