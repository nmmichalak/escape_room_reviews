"Escape room ""The Informant"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-informant,0,"Fun room! We did the Informant room which had a fun spy theme. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the way they tied hints and emergency stuff into the story of the room so it kept the story alive. Very fun place, and one of my favorite staff interactions! The owner was very friendly and talked to us about games and other escape rooms. I canâ€™t wait to go back!"
