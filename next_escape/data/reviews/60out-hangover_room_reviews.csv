"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,0,We came to 60out for our yearly team building day and we had so much fun! We got the Hangover room and escaped. It was awesome! Our team consisted of five and none of us have ever done an escape room so we considered this a win! Highly recommend and Victoria was great!
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,1,The Hangover was my 38th room. This room was decorative and set the scene up for the story. It made me feel like I was immersed in the story quite well. The puzzles were actually fun to do and were quick and on a whim type of solving. No real scavenger hunt in here which was nice and towards the end waa my favorite part because of the props we had to use in order to get out. Loved all of it.

We had to do something physical in this room that we've never done before, which was super cool! It's a pretty tech-heavy room and uses almost all your senses. I don't think there were any traditional lock-key puzzles (though I could be wrong). The end is incredibly clever!"

It was lots of fun and we really enjoyed it.At first, I was a reluctant Escape Room virgin but I am so glad I gave this a try. The reason I was initially hesitant is because I don't like places where I can't get out, and I don't like being scared. Haunted houses and being mid row in any arena is my nightmare.These games are terrific because they help you work together as a team while tapping into out of the box thinking and communication skills. I look forward to an opportunity to try another escape room.My friends said this was one of the better ones they have been to in LA and Phoenix."
