"Escape room ""Escape San Quentin"" by Locked Up Bloomington in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/locked-up-bloomington-escape-san-quentin,0,"This place is awesome! Was in town for a couple days and did the San Quentin room on Friday. The staff was well trained and the business is clean and well taken care of. The lobby was like walking into a fancy cocktail bar, chandeliers and all! It was a blast and I highly recommend this to anyone in the Bloomington area!"
"Escape room ""Escape San Quentin"" by Locked Up Bloomington in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/locked-up-bloomington-escape-san-quentin,1,Fantastic time! Wonderful staff! This was a fun date night for my fianc√© and I. We had never had the experience of doing an Escape Room prior to this. We chose San Quentin for the first room! Very challenging room that keeps you thinking and problem-solving until the very end! I highly recommend this place!

We did the San Quentin jail cell and although we didn't escape we had a ball trying! WE WERE SO CLOSE!!! If you're looking for something different to do I'd recommend Locked Up in Bloomington. We'll be back!
