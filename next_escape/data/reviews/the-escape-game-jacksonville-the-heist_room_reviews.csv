"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-the-heist,0,"The facility was so meticulously maintained. So much fun for my daughter, grandson and I to use clues to solve a mystery. The employees were cordial and enthusiastic. If all other The Mystery Game facilities are as impressive I will look forward my next fun experience."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-the-heist,1,We had an amazing time!!! I highly recommend with family or friends! We were there with our family and my daughter’s boyfriend. They went above and beyond when I wrote them and email and told them it was my daughter’s 16th birthday! It was challenging but not frustrating as our guide helped us when we got pretty “close” on a few things! The best part is.... YOU PUT YOUR PHONES DOWN! It was nice to have that uninterrupted time with my family on my daughter’s birthday. We can’t wait to go back and my 12 year old son now wants to do this for his birthday! Thank you Escape Room!!!

The room itself was good, with an impressive design. The puzzles varied with some being interesting, some kind of easy and one in particular being a lot of trial and error. The game master, Gabe, was very helpful, though the store uses screens to communicate which I wasn't a huge fan of. Overall not bad."
