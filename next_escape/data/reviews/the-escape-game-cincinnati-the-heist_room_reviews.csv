"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-the-heist,0,"A friend and I decided last minute to do an escape room, and were able to book a reservation only about an hour in advance with no issues. We signed up for a room with 6 other strangers - and the family we got to work with in our escape room was wonderful. The two ladies helping us in the lobby area and during our game were wonderful. The clues that they gave us when we asked for help were great, and the room was a good difficulty. It was my first escape room experience, but Iâ€™d definitely recommend The Escape Game for your next escape room!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-the-heist,1,"The rooms here are heavily themed and immersive! We came today to do the Gold Rush room and it was amazing. We loved how detailed everything was, and the puzzles were fun to solve! We ended up having so much fun that we went and had lunch and came right back to do another room, The Heist! This room was also really cool and had a great theme. All of the staff we encountered were super nice, including our game masters Jeremy and Kita. We can't wait to come back and play the rest! I only wish there were an infinite number of rooms for us to play. This is definitely the best escape room facility in Cincinnati, and an awesome addition to The Banks!"

It was a surprise! I thought we were doing dinner (which we did later). It has been a while since I've had the kind of fun we had! The challenge was phenomenal! (we did ""The Heist"".) We cannot wait to do it again soon! We didn't escape, but we didn't care because it was BLAST!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-the-heist,3,"Eight of us did ""The Heist"" and we Almost Escaped - we literally had the last puzzle figured out as the time ran out!  Oh well...it was still totally amazing and fun.  It was a lot more exciting than I had imagined - with the time clock ticking away and so many clues to figure out - it was non-stop action!  The puzzles were so well thought out and difficult enough to feel like we accomplished something when we finally solved them.  The props and decor was so perfect - it felt like we were on a movie set.  We all had a great time and then went down the street to Condado Taco for dinner and then the SkyWheel.  Wonderful evening and we will be back soon."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-the-heist,4,"Simply the best. The Escape Game Cincinnati is my favorite company in the tri-state. The rooms are immaculate, immersive, creative, and beautiful. Every room offered is spectacular. However, The Heist is special for a few reasons. First, it offers endless surprise. Museums are expected to be stiff and boring. I expected challenging, but subdued, puzzles. The atmosphere when entering The Heist is sterile and just what you'd expect from an art museum, but by the time you break out, the room(s) are buzzing with excitement and intrigue! Second, puzzle design is awesome and varied. I am a seasoned escape room player and I couldn't help but grin at every new, neat idea the company employed to make this room stand out. Finally, you can extend the game experience from this room to home! TEG sells an at-home ""escape game"" extension from The Heist's storyline. It is short, but fun, and adds just another unique element to this room. Anyway, I highly recommend 10/10 and this room ties for best room with this company (with Gold Rush). The Heist will go down as one of my favorite escape games, ever!"
