The vault was wonderfully atmospheric and challenging; we really felt like we'd accomplished something wonderful when we escaped with minutes to spare! Chandler was a wonderful master of games and we all enjoyed his guidance and camera concealed presence! Many thanks and we hope to visit again soon!!"

The room looked great and had some awesome special effects. The puzzles were tricky but there were unlimited clues, so that was nice. I will definitely be back to try more rooms!"
