The host for the hunt was the right amount of helpful and efficient. It was definitely a harder challenge but it was also the first escape room I had ever done. I would definitely recommend this to a friend!

This was my first escape room experience, so I didn't really know what to expect. The room was definitely challenging- and a ton do fun for the whole group! Service was great- the facilitators were super nice and accommodating. Thanks, Great Escape Room!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-library-sherlocks-study,2,We did Sherlock's Library and had a really good time! It was actually quite a tough room. We were 10 seconds over the allotted 60 mins. Would definitely come again for another room.
