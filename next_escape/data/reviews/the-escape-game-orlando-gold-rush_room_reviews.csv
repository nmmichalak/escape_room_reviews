"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-game-orlando-gold-rush,0,"We went the other night as a group of four (42,14,11,9) and had so much fun! This was our first escape room, and we hope to do many more! We were pared with a group of three, and our teamwork was great! We started off kind of slow, but managed to finish Gold Rush with over 9 minutes left and one clue left! It is worth the fee, but if it was cheaper it would be good as well. Enjoyed it very much, and hope to do many more in the future! The staff was very nice and helpful."

From the moment we arrived, the employees shared an ""excited to see you"" attitude. It appeared as though everyone really enjoyed working there, which added to our positive experience. The game provided a variety of interesting, unique challenges that our eight member group worked together to solve. We all agreed that it was an hour well spent!!"

I have done many rooms and these were some of the best I've ever done. Would definitely recommend Gold Rush, as this was my favorite room we did. "
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-game-orlando-gold-rush,3,My friend and I went to Escape Game Orlando with our two grown daughters for a fun day out. It was far more than we expected. We did the Gold rush game and found it to be very challenging. A lot of creative thought went into this place. I would encourage anyone to go who wants a completely different experience and lots of fun to go. We are going back again soon to try our hand at a more difficult room. We are bringing some new people for the experience.

The Escape Game is a well-organized, family oriented, wonderful place to visit. Staff is friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend this for families and organizations interested in team building activities! Great fun!!!"
