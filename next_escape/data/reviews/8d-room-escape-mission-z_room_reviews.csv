The scenario, gadgets, and props were very creative; better than what I've seen elsewhere. One or two of the puzzles were kind of impossible to solve without using a hint, but overall they were satisfying to work through."

But all of us did have a great time and that's what really matters! I've been to about 6 or 7 different rooms and this definitely had the most puzzles. I recommend at least 4 people to do this room as three didn't really have enough brain power to make it through the long list of challenges.Some of the clues and mini puzzles were quite obtuse and I wonder if anyone's made it out without ANY hints. Regardless, it shows that they put a lot of time into designing a room that kept you busy."
