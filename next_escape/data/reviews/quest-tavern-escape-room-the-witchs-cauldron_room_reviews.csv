"Escape room ""The Witch's Cauldron"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-the-witchs-cauldron,1,We did the witch's cauldron. We had 6. I feel that was an appropriate team size for the room. It was fun. We escaped. We have done many escapes and we needed some hints. Don't be afraid to ask for hints. Jordan was our host. He was friendly and told a great story. Thanks for an awesome time!
