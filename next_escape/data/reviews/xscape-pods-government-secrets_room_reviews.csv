"Escape room ""Government Secrets"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-government-secrets,0,"So excited to have a new entertainment option in Chino Hills!  The owners were friendly and fun to chat with, the decor impressive and authentic, and the game was difficult but SO MUCH fun!  We managed to beat the Government Secrets room with just over a minute to spare.  This was my first escape room experience and it was a fantastic one!  I can't wait to go back when the other rooms are completed.  If you like escape rooms, I highly recommend trying this one!"

They did an awesome job with the decor and the room itself was well thought out and kept us interested! We were greeted by the owner and creator of the rooms! He was nice and welcoming. Overall the whole experience was great. Of the three rooms to choose from we did ""Government Secrets"" skill level was moderate lots of communication between participants is key! I would come back to this location to do the other two rooms and anymore in the future."
