My family (6 of us) did the Fun Time Game Show Challenge last night. The room was decorated in a really cool way: it was true to retro game shows. The puzzles were challenging and fun at the same time, and there was something for all of us to solve (kids' ages are 13-18). The gentlemen who were running the puzzle could not have been nicer, and only helped when we really needed it. The hour flew by! We can't wait to try the Timekeeper's Challenge next!"

We had an adult, a 17-year-old, a 15-year-old and two 13-year-olds and made it out of the Game Room with 5 minutes to spare! Our host was amazing! She didnâ€™t give too much information and ruin the fun. Been to many escape rooms and this is among our favorites! Thank you!"

The game show room was just fantastic. The girls divided and solved the tasks. Not over their heads but not easy. Need a few helpful moments from the moms. But overall it was a great experience.
