"Escape room ""Curse of Anubis"" by Escape On 13th in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/escape-on-13th-curse-of-anubis,0,"I haven't seen a room like this anywhere else in Salt Lake, and their price is super reasonable for the valley and what you get. We walked in and the staff was friendly, then they opened our entrance door into the awesomely themed room! We were able to escape, and let me say, 4 rooms in one escape game was SO FUN. Just kept exploring deeper into the pyramid. Cool effects. If you like Indiana Jones, this is for you. We've played all their games and had a blast. Then we left the game and they got a free souvenir picture for us that was very professional. Good times!"
