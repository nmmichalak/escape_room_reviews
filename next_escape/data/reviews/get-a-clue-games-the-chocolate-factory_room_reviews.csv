We had SO much fun, and got out with just 8 minutes to spare. We can't wait to go back and try our luck at the other rooms. We would recommend this to anyone for a date night! They also do parties and team building for those in the work force."

Dawn is so personable and is so welcoming! She helps you whenever you are in trouble. They are accommodating with children and even babies. I brought my 11-month-old daughter along and she made sure she was comfortable. We had a great time doing the Chocolate Factory even though we didn't escape. I can't wait to go back!!
