"Escape room ""Bogeyman"" by Trap Door Escape Room in Long Branch",https://worldofescapes.com/long-branch/quests/trap-door-escape-room-bogeyman,0,"Did the Bogeyman in Redbank. I have done over 40 something escape rooms, and this is one of my favorite rooms I have ever done. They mix fear with emotion and have unique puzzles that would normally be very easy to me, but the room made it so difficult because you become so immersed in the story, you can't think straight. You begin to feel for these families whose kids are taken by the Bogeyman. Masterfully done, I wish I could do it again. We had Anthony, he was so nice, we went into our room late, because of no fault but our own, we couldn't stop talking to him, because he was so friendly."
