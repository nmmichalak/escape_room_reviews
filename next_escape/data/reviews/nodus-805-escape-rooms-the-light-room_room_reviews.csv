"Escape room ""The Light Room"" by Nodus 805 Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/nodus-805-escape-rooms-the-light-room,0,"Wonderful experience! We did the Light Room and were impressed by the quality and intricacy of the puzzles. It was made to be solved by a group, so it allowed all eight of us to work together. No one was standing around bored. The puzzles felt cohesive and very carefully crafted. It was great to meet and talk with the designer, Alex, as well! So much fun!"
"Escape room ""The Light Room"" by Nodus 805 Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/nodus-805-escape-rooms-the-light-room,1,We did The Light Room and got out with 6 seconds to spare. It was great to work together and figure out the clues to successfully finish on our first try. Will definitely go back to try the other room and see if we can conquer that one as well.
"Escape room ""The Light Room"" by Nodus 805 Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/nodus-805-escape-rooms-the-light-room,2,First time at Nodus805 and went for the Light Room. Alex provided us with a great back story and was very helpful when we needed hints. The room itself was very interesting in the setup and how all the puzzles work together. Can't wait to go back and try the other room.
"Escape room ""The Light Room"" by Nodus 805 Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/nodus-805-escape-rooms-the-light-room,3,My coworkers and I (4 total) did the Lightroom. It was quite challenging and we used the whole hour but completed it! The puzzles were challenging but one or two hints in the right direction help A LOT. Alex at Nodus 805 is a great guy and has done a lot of work to balance the room and provides helpful clear hints if necessary.The ambiance is a little low BUT if there were too many false clues or distractions then it might be too difficult. This was my first escape room but my coworkers had done a few before. I recommend going with a team of more experienced people.

Cori at Nodus was great and explained everything clearly before putting us in the room - she also helped by providing 15 minutes updates as to the time remaining (yeah, there is a clock in the room but trust me it is the last thing you'll have time to be looking at).  We had a great time. Next stop - The Study!"
