It is a pretty easy room for experienced players, but still a good room. The second one we played is ""Masquerade"". This one is a hard one. The puzzles in this room are pretty well designed. Overall, great staff and great experience."

They set the bar for customer service and overall experience. I love the Masquerade Room! One of my favorite out of the 20-ish, I've done.I haven't been disappointed by an Exodus Escape Room yet! But it is the customer service that sets Exodus apart for me."

Masquerade Manor is such a fun game, with pleasing aesthetics and clever puzzles. The experience of playing is really great too because it's personalized! I won't mention how, you just gotta play the game and see. But really, it makes the experience so immersive and special. Shoutout to James for being one of the coolest people I've ever met who runs escape rooms! I can't wait to play more of their rooms!"

Escape rooms are so much fun and especially Exodus Escape Rooms! Over the weekend we played the new Masquerade Room which was challenging but a great experience. Really makes you think outside the box. The staff here was very passionate about what they are doing. The experience was top notch!!!"
