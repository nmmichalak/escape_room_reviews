"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-dig-az,0,"What an annoying time, the whole room was tired to the ability to solve a freaking slide puzzle.  Every thing else you can piece it together, but if none in your team can do it good luck. Highly disappointed and would not recommend this room just based on the slide puzzle.  I would give the other rooms a try."

"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-dig-az,2,"Very cool. Definitely a different way to spend a Saturday night! Our room was like an archeology, ""Indiana Jones""-type room. We spent the hour trying to decipher hieroglyphics and codes to try and find our way out but came up a few minutes short. Our Clue master was great and guided us well. We will definitely go back and try the other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-dig-az,3,"Came here with my wife and 8 friends for ""The Dig"" and had an absolute blast! The escape is challenging in that you all have to work as a team while receiving clues. While one person may interpret a clue one way, another person may have a different approach to things. If you want to get out within the allotted 60 minutes, you need to work as a team. Luckily, we got out in 58:59!"

It was super fun and we got out with 4 minutes to spare. It makes you ""dig"" deep (ha!), get creative and really look beyond the norm. I would definitely suggest it for a fun night!"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-dig-az,5,"I came here to celebrate my birthday with my co-workers and we had so much fun!!! Loved the Dig, I thought it was really kind of difficult and the whole thing was really intense. However, it was definitely a lot of fun and exciting every time we figured out a clue. We ended up getting out with two minutes to spare!! It's a bit pricey but I definitely want to come back to try the other rooms!!"
