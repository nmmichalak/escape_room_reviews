It was our first time doing an escape room and it made a great first impression on us.  The puzzles were all very creative and the dark, spooky ambiance set the mood perfectly when we did this right around Halloween last year.  Staff was great, setting was great, props were good, and difficulty was high (we were very close and got stuck on the same directional lock as reviewer Justin).  We all recommend this one very highly."

Had a great time. We did the Cabin in the Woods and the ambiance was awesome. However, we didnâ€™t know how to reset one of the locks. We wished that someone had helped through the intercom as we had the right combination, but had just never used a directional lock before. So that really prevented us advancing through the room. Really a bummer. But it was fun anyhow."

The game is played in the dark with a flashlight. I felt like the two they gave us were not enough for everyone to feel involved.The room itself was fun but really hard. Staff was super nice. We had a malfunction on one of the tasks but they helped us and then gave us extra time. So I enjoyed this even though we did not make it out.
