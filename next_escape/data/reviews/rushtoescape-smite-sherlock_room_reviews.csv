Dave was an outstanding host.  The rooms were perfectly set up.  It was challenging and intensely fun.  Everyone had a blast.   This was the 3rd escape room in Vegas i’ve been to, and by far — the Best.    thank you!  "

Played the Sherlock room with a group of six, and it was well worth the money. Everyone had something to do, and we also had to work together as a team. Already planning to book the Prison room and go back!"

With just the two of us playing, and it being our first time, it was definitely challenging and we had to ask for help a few times when we were stuck. But still it was so much fun!!!"
