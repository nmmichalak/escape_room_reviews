"Escape room ""Cursed Crypt"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-cursed-crypt,0,"Cursed Crypt, my 3rd room at Escape Hotel, is a solid showing from a severely under-rated location.  Formerly the Tomb Raider room which displaced Sanatorium, your group is given the challenge of finding the final piece to an ancient artifact.  You start in a mausoleum that could have been straight out of the film itself.  The transitions between rooms was a little odd; mausoleum to a study to a boat to a temple but the production of those ""roomscapes"" was up there with the best.  Blaring sirens, wind and rain, lightning and thunder, the hum of the boats engine, the whole experience was flooded with immersive lights and sounds.  There was moderate amount of scavenging and tasking but overall, the puzzles were engaging and well tied to the theme.  The hosts in the lobby were friendly and professional but this room in particular, though, suffers from a lack of support.  For as much as these rooms cost, there really is no excuse for inattentive GMs.  Hints were generally ""keep doing what you're doing"", ""look harder"", or for something we had already finished.  And we escaped into an empty corridor with no GM to greet us.  Combined with the poor quality walkie-talkies and loud sounds I mentioned earlier made communication that much more frustrating.  But hint system and GMs aside, Cursed Crypt still comes out strong and ranks 42nd out of 129 rooms I've done so far.  Highly recommended for fans of deeply immersive rooms!"

The first time I came, I walked in pleasantly surprised by just the lobby because of how it was decorated. It's meant to give you the creeps and they do a great job of doing that from the start. All of the employees are so funny too! You can tell they have a lot of fun with their job and they're not afraid to joke around with guests. I decided to bring some friends who were still pretty new to escape rooms and when they went to the restroom, someone went over the intercom whispering their names (and duh I loved that). Out of the rooms they have, I've done Cocaine, Circus, Escape Room Movie, Slaughtered, Cursed Crypt, and Espionage. All of them did a great job of making the group feel immersed and it was always a challenge. I'm absolutely coming back to try and finish the rest and whatever else they come out with!!"

Staff was in character from the moment we arrived which was entertaining. Did two rooms, ""Slaughter"" and ""Cursed Crypt"" and both were very well put together; from puzzles, engineering to room design. Wish we had time to do the others! Thanks for your help, Jose! You were awesome."
