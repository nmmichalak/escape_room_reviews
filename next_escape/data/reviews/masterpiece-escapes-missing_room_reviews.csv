"Escape room ""Missing"" by Masterpiece Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/masterpiece-escapes-missing,0,This was our first escape room experience. We took our daughter and friends for her 16th birthday. We loved it!! Staff was great! The 'Missing' Room was just challenging enough and spooky enough to show us a good time. I definitely recommend this place!
"Escape room ""Missing"" by Masterpiece Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/masterpiece-escapes-missing,1,This place is phenomenal! We did the Missing and our hearts were racing the whole time. Pure adrenaline rush and the owner puts so much into these rooms that you actually feel like the character and it’s a real life scenario. Best one I’ve been to thus far. Can’t wait to try all the rooms.

"Escape room ""Missing"" by Masterpiece Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/masterpiece-escapes-missing,3,"I'd highly recommend this place. The owners/staff really care about the experience of their guests, and their Missing room is hands down one of my favorite rooms in/around Charlotte so far (I've done around 15-20 with my hubby). No spoilers - Missing was well constructed and felt very immersive. It had a neat story, cool puzzles, and a couple of unexpected surprises. I look forward to going back and trying out their other rooms!"
