Thanks to our host John for answering our questions."

Went with a group for a friend's birthday to save the world from a nuclear annihilation and had loads of fun! If you like the fun of solving multiple kinds of puzzles, teamed a time limit urgency (you only have 1 hour), you definitely want to check the joint out."

The puzzles are just challenging enough, and the whole experience is very well put-together. Would highly recommend for a night out with friends that's different than the usual dinner/drinks/movie. It's fun to see how everyone approaches the puzzles differently, sees things from different perspectives, and work together to complete it."
