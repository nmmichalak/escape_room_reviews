"Escape room ""Pandemic Zero"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/omescape-san-jose-pandemic-zero,0,"My first time was the Pandemic Zero. Without spoiling anything, I have to say that this room was really fantastic. It has really awesome production value and you really feel like you are in the environment. The puzzles were the perfect amount of difficulty for my group. We escaped with a couple minutes to spare, but still felt the urgency at the end. It was the first time my friends were doing an escape room and it was the perfect intro into the world of escape rooms. They loved it. "

There were 6 of us total which fills up the max capacity.I have to admit that this escape room by far has the highest production value that I've experienced. Everything was fully functional and interactive. The room was quite challenging, so we were given an extra 10 minutes since we were so close, and finished only 3 minutes over! I have to admit, it was extremely kind of our host to give us the extra time and we left super satisfied.We will definitely be back again!"

All of these rooms were beautifully put together. The production value was high, the puzzles were interesting and well-integrated into the rooms such that they didn't just seem random and forced, and the entire experience is fun for both beginners and veterans alike.I highly recommend Omescape - they have never failed to provide an exciting time and impress the friends that I bring with me."
"Escape room ""Pandemic Zero"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/omescape-san-jose-pandemic-zero,3,I've done a lot of escape rooms and the one we did at OMescape was both challenging and had incredible technology to it. Really fun and difficult. I would recommend you do the easier rooms before working up to the harder ones as they are seriously difficult.

The production value of the two rooms I've tried were pretty amazing. It kind of felt like being in a movie! It averages at about 30 bucks a person, but trust me - it's worth it. Shout out to the staff for being so amazing as well. The first time my group was late (don't recommend showing up late to anyone though), but they still let us have a full hour. The guy also took the time to walk us through what we missed after not escaping! I can't wait to go back and try the third room. "
