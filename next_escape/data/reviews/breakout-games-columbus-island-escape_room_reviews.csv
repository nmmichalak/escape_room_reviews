My brother and I did the Island Escape.  Very nice decor and high-tech puzzles.  Electro-magnets, compressed air, special privacy filter glasses, etc.  We failed to escape but had a blast anyway!"

I was a bit hesitant at first because my group wasnt a full 8 so we had the chance of getting paired up with strangers. That did end up happening, but it was actually really fun. They ended up being helpful and it was really fun."

One team did the Island Escape and the other did Casino. We all had a great time. So close to escaping but fell short by a couple clues. Great staff! Great rooms!! We'll be back!!
