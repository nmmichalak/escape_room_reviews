"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-spellbound,1,"This is a cool place.  It is such a unique and creatively decorated space- the details really draw you in.  We arrived the 15 minutes early as you are supposed to and were greeted by the owner.  She was super friendly, energetic and you could tell that this place was a passion project for her and her husband.  She chatted us up about their business and we could tell that a lot of planning went into the whole thing.A few minutes later her husband and our game master walked us through our scenario for ""Spellbound"".   My hubby and I were the only two slotted for this spot.  That was a good thing since others were supposed to be with us and the room was a small space.  I am glad we didn't have other people in there or we would have been a bit crammed.  The room was neat.  It had a good combination of technology, quirkiness, puzzles and good old need for attention to details.  We have done about 10 escape rooms between us before this one and it was thoughtfully created and a good level of difficulty.  We made it out with 4 minutes to go too!  It is definitely worth the visit.  I can't wait to check out one of their other rooms next time we are in town!"

The staff is super friendly and funny as well! We went in to do Alice's Dream. Came with 3 others so we played with 4 total. It was big enough where we all could contribute and find clues. We absolutely loved it. So fun, some really good challenges! We loved it so much that when we went outside and got In the car we all decided we didn't want to leave. So we went back in and played Spell Bound. That one is very good as well! Very tricky. Over all we had SO much fun. Would definitely try their other location on our next trip."
