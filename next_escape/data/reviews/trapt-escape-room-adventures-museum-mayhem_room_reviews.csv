"Escape room ""Museum Mayhem"" by trap't Escape Room Adventures in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/trapt-escape-room-adventures-museum-mayhem,0,My friends and I had so much fun at Museum Mayhem! We've done six escape rooms before and this place is definitely the most challenging! What's great is that they offer unlimited clues which is so helpful! They even offered us a few extra minutes to escape which was so nice since we were struggling. Felt like they cared more about you having fun and solving the puzzles than just taking your money and sending you home after 60 minutes unlike other places I've been.The owners were wonderful - so friendly and very helpful with the hints. We stayed after for at least 15-20 minutes just chatting. But what amazed me even more was the husband Stuart invented and built the rooms! If that's not talent I don't know what is.My friends and I will be going back to do the other rooms and because Jill and Stuart were such great people! Definitely recommend to other people!

Ended up unexpectedly teamed up with friends from church. Did the Museum Room which was challenging, well laid out and lots of fun. And we ended up setting a record for completing it because we worked really well together! Staff was absolutely amazing. Can't wait to come back and try the new rooms once they are ready!"
