"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Burnsville in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escapology-burnsville-antidote,0,"Visited the Burnsville Minnesota location of Escapology. Had a wonderful time. This was the first time I had been to Escapology. My girl friend and I had chosen Antidote. Some of the clues were easy, and some of the them challenging. Megan was our Gamemaster, and she made the experience a lot of fun. She was very thorough in her explanation of Escapology. Planning on going back again. Hope to have Megan as our Gamemaster next time. What a Blast !!!"
