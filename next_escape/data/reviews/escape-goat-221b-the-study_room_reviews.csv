"Escape room ""221B The Study"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-221b-the-study,0,"This experience was a serious rush. I highly recommend the 221B experience. It was such an adrenaline rush for any fan of Sherlock or escape room junkie looking for a challenge. We certainly entered the world of our favorite detective, and I bow to those able to crack all the mental puzzles within the time allotted.Make sure your Mind Palace is prepared for this intense case!"
"Escape room ""221B The Study"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-221b-the-study,1,"As local Winter Garden/Ocoee residents our group is incredibly happy and lovingly welcome Escape Goat to the community. We did room 221b and it was brilliant- to say the least. Having only been to two other escape rooms, this was by far the best - and we loved the other two we did as well but this blew them out of the water. The puzzles in this room were inventive, fresh, different and thought-provoking. The owners are the loveliest of people and we can't wait to come back and visit them. Can't say enough good things. "
