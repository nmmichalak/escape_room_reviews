"Escape room ""Nautilus"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-nautilus,1,"Our family of 4 completed the Nautilus clue room with 30 seconds to spare. The staff is friendly, and the facilities clean and well-maintained. They want you to succeed. The puzzles are developed in-house, so you never have to worry about booking a room and then finding that you've done the same puzzle elsewhere. We had so much fun that we decided to do the next puzzle right then and there. Finished that one with 4 minutes left. Pay a visit to Clue Room, because it's really fun to be the smartest person in the room!"
