"Escape room ""Hollywood Premiere - Destination Los Angeles"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-hollywood-premiere-destination-los-angeles,0,"We recently tried the Mystery Room on a trip to visit family in Georgia, and it was so much fun! We honestly thought it was going to be super easy, and maybe a little hokey, but it was neither! It was really challenging, and not at all cheesy! We did the Royal room and Hollywood room, both were excellent! Make sure to come with your brain prepared to think outside the box! Definitely recommend, if we lived closer I would go back and try all of the other 4 rooms!"

We did both the Hollywood and sports room. The sports room should be done with at least six people. We have a 12 and 11 year old who enjoyed every minute of it and said can we do it again. The staff is very nice and knowledgeable. We loved it. It is worth a try.

Lots of fun in the Hollywood Room. Going again to try black ops room with friends this time.
