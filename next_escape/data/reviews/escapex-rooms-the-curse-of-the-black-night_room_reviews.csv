"Escape room ""The Curse of the Black Knight"" by EscapeX Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapex-rooms-the-curse-of-the-black-night,0,"Having done all of EscapeX's other rooms we were very excited to try out their new room, The Curse of the Black Knight.As with all their other rooms, they did not disappoint with the amount of detail and storytelling that is intricately and meticulously built into the rooms.  We were able to escape but the puzzles were definitely challenging and keep you on your toes.The tech in this room was fantastic and seamless, anytime something would be completed or unlocked the transitions were seamless and very well designed.Our game master, Anthony, did a fantastic job setting the stage and environment for the room.  That is the one thing I've always truly enjoyed about EscapeX is the effort they put not only in their rooms but the stories and introductions.Fantastic job as always, we can't wait for your next new room in the future!"
"Escape room ""The Curse of the Black Knight"" by EscapeX Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapex-rooms-the-curse-of-the-black-night,1,"This place is amazing! I tried the Mafia Heist room months ago, and had a blast. However, today I had the pleasure to help beta test the new Curse of the Black Knight room, and it exceeded every expectation I had. The attention to detail not only with the puzzles but also the immersion and decor was outstanding, and my friends and I felt a real sense of accomplishment after finishing each puzzle. Watch your step, keep your eyes open, and prepare for an adventure, because the rooms here pack a serious punch!"

Their newest game, the Cursed Knight is a perfect example of something new and innovative while still being approachable by newer player.  Definitely check this escape room out."
