"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-games-montgomery-mystery-mansion,0,"Had an awesome time at Breakout Games. The rooms were awesome! We've done three different rooms here, Kidnaping, Hostage and Mystery Mansion, all were challenging and so much fun. The guys at Breakout were awesome as well, celebrating with us like they had broken out too. If you are looking for a fun group activity, this is the place to go, I would recommend going on days when it won't be too busy, or having enough in your group to take up all the spots. Definitely well worth it though!"

Brought my dad and family for Father's Day and he really enjoyed it! He had never done anything like this before. We did the new Mystery Mansion room. It was a little hard, but fun nonetheless! I will bring him back to try another room."

Our game-master was first rate and made the experience challenging and still fun. We did the ""Mystery Mansion"" room and recommend it. Have fun!"
