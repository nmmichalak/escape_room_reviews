"Escape room ""Mayhem on the Menu"" by Mental Mansion in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/mental-mansion-mayhem-on-the-menu,0,"Went to Mental Mansion for a friend's birthday and somehow managed to complete this room. This was my first escape room experience outside of a video game. ""Mayhem"" is the perfect word for it. Had so much fun! Highly recommend!  "

We did the Mayhem on the Menu one and it was a good combo of challenging, active, and fun. Some really creative stuff in there, and you can tell that Casey cares about making a good escape room experience. Looking forward to trying out the other one!"
