"Escape room ""Dinner Party"" by Brainstorm Escape Room Bonita Springs in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/breakout-escape-room-bs-dinner-party,0,Our group of cousins gets together every once in a while to have some fun. This was by far the most fun-filled day ever! There were six of us in the group and they recommended the Dinner Mystery room for us. It was so much fun that the time flew by. We can't wait to go back and try out another room. The owners are so personably and friendly. We can't say enough about them or the experience. We highly recommend for everyone to try this.

We really had a blast. This is the nicest escape room I've ever been to. We did the Dinner Party room, had a little spooky touch. Even under pressure we really couldn't stop laughing. We had such a good time. The owner and staff are so down to earth, super welcoming, funny, and so nice. I'm already planning my next trip. Do yourself a favor and go, you won't regret it."

I was super excited and also kind of nervous. We had 3 girls in our group and made it out with about 5 minutes to spare! We did the Dinner Party room and I thought it was very well put together. It was so much fun! The clues were unique and helpful. I definitely want to come back and try the other rooms!"

The interaction with the hosts was hilarious. I was super impressed with the decor in the rooms, you really felt transported to the scene. The puzzles were interesting and really got your brain cranking to the utmost degree. The clues were super helpful and we got out just in time. The Dinner Party was our room and we can't wait to try all the rooms. Perfect for pre-dinner, post dinner, birthdays, team building, friends or ANY occasion. Love love love this place!"
