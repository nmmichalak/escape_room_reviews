"Escape room ""You Can't Handle the Truth"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-you-cant-handle-the-truth,0,"This was our first escape room ever.  And although we didn't make it out on time, we had a blast with only 3 people. Would recommend to anybody who wants to see how smart they really are. 5 out of 5 are going back to do another room. Keep it up guys!!!!"
"Escape room ""You Can't Handle the Truth"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-you-cant-handle-the-truth,1,I had a great time! I came here with my friend and participated in a 60-minute room. Prices are worth the experience - $29 each. Staff was super friendly and welcomed all questions. Challenge Accepted provides something new and refreshing (instead of a typical movie night).

Definitely  worth a visit, especially if you're already a fan of escape rooms. Not alienating for beginners, though."
