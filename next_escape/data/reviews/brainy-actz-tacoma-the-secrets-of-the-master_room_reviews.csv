"Escape room ""The Secrets of The Master"" by Brainy Actz Tacoma in Tacoma",https://worldofescapes.com/tacoma/quests/brainy-actz-tacoma-the-secrets-of-the-master,0,"I walked by this place while walking my puppy on Tacoma Ave. S. and I just walked in and was greeted by very welcoming staff who took the time to show me around even though they were busy with a company team building fun lazer tag event going on.  The person who greeted me showed me the escape rooms which are diverse and include all sorts of interesting and mind teasers to get you out of the room so fun but also a little bit testing on your friends to see who really knows their stuff! ;-)  Its all just for fun and they seem to be always coming up with new ideas.Wait, did I mention the view?  They are located just off of I-5 not far from the transit center, Tacoma Dome, museums, climbing wall, and about three or four breweries in walking distance.    With Mount Rainier for a nice view and I believe they do sip and paint but maybe that was me just pitching it to them."
