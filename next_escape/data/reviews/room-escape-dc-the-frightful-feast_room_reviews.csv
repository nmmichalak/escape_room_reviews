This place did not disappoint! It was adequately ranked with a higher difficulty level and the host, Kevin, did an awesome job in giving us (the allotted amount of) hints and prepping us prior to going in the room. I will definitely be doing this again!"

"Escape room ""The Frightful Feast"" by Room Escape DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/room-escape-dc-the-frightful-feast,3,"Coworkers and I participated in the Frightful Feast. We had to escape a poorly lit cell before being ""eaten by three monsters."" Like you would imagine from any escape room, there were numerous amounts of puzzles, riddles, and locks to solve. Solving everything can be difficult, but if your team needs help, you can use the walky talky provided to ask up to three hints.Overall, Room Escape DC provides exciting plots for their rooms with carefully thought out puzzles and riddles. There is no doubt that you will have a gerat time cooperating with your team to escape the room under-pressure."
