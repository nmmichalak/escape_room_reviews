"Escape room ""Year of the Roommate"" by The Hidden Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-hidden-escape-year-of-the-roommate,0,"This escape room is brand new on the west side of town, but we've already done ""Year of the Roommate"" and we loved it! We've done escape rooms all around Atlanta, and this one is up to par on the level of detail you would want at an Escape Room.Some rooms just build out existing infrastructure, but they've done theirs from scratch. Tall ceilings and adequate room space make this a win for those concerned about doing an escape room or feeling claustrophobic. I would recommend having at least 4 people on Year of the Roommate. Can't wait until ""Orion"" opens up. I've heard it's going to be incredible."

"Escape room ""Year of the Roommate"" by The Hidden Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-hidden-escape-year-of-the-roommate,2,"Absolutely loved my first visit to the Hidden Escape! We played ""The Year of the Roommate"" and it had the perfect ratio of challenging clues vs. those quick-to-get-it moments that keep your adrenaline rushing throughout the whole 60 minutes! You'll be talking with your friends about your experience for days! Also, the owners are simply first-class. You can tell they really love what they do just by their passion and excitement presenting you the room, and they obviously value your feedback at the end of your experience. You won't be disappointed! I can't wait to try their new room ""Orion""."
