Not only was the room fun and challenging, but it's easily the best production value of any escape room I've been to. I've been to some rooms where it looked like they bought all their props at a dollar store. That's not this! The quality of the sets & props are amazing and consistent with anything you see in high end haunted houses or escape room game shows like Hellevator.Can't wait to go back & take on another room!"

So many puzzles. One of the best escapes I've ever experienced. The story line was complete, the clues were easy to follow, and just the right amount of surprise and difficulty. Our group of 5 made it out with 4 minutes to spare! Wish we had time to do all the rooms!"
