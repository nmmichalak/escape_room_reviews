Challenging puzzles, but not difficult to the point of frustration. Seems like a good room for first-timers. And Victoria, the game master, was great!"
"Escape room ""Alice in Wonderland"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-alice-in-wonderland,3,"In terms of the theme, this one is probably my favorite out of all the ones that  I have done. I attempted this room as a group of 2 and I felt like we could have definitely used an extra brain or 2 for this room. Overall we had a blast doing this room as our game master was definitely helpful in pushing us in the right direction. The room was well made, with all the techy and non-techy parts of the room. Overall we had a great experience with this room."

This room is on the bottom floor and is accessed by their new lobby area. The room had great production value and is definitely the cutest, brightest, and most colorful room there. It is also challenging and has a variety of puzzles, good tech, and some playful challenges that might best be managed by a group of 4 people. We had one mechanical issue, but it didn't affect the flow of the game."
