We both loved it and would definitely come back again. It was open to all ages and was a good way to build up teamwork. The staff was extremely nice. I would definitely recommend this place.

We had sooo much fun! We did the study...the clues were hard but super fun to try and solve. This was my first escape game and def not my last. The staff was awesome and very helpful! Can't wait to try the laboratory! TeamDana!!!

I brought appetizers and drinks 30 minutes before the game so we could gather and strategize. The reception area was a great hangout while we waited for our game! Edward gave us a warm greeting and a thorough explanation of everything we needed to know before entering the game. The puzzles are difficult and we were able to keep all 14 players busy. I got to meet the owners, Greg and Shannon while I was there and they told me their newest game will be ready soon. I cannot WAIT! They really created an amazing place that surpasses other Escape Game I have enjoyed. This is a fantastic night out."
