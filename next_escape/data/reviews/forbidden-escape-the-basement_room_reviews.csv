"Escape room ""The Basement"" by Forbidden Escape in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/forbidden-escape-the-basement,0,It was great. We got out with minutes to spare. Some clues were easy and others had us thinking. We have done others in the past. We are addicted to these things. Can't wait till the next room is ready. We will be back.

"Escape room ""The Basement"" by Forbidden Escape in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/forbidden-escape-the-basement,4,"This was so much fun - but it is super scary if you're a wimp (like me). It's not that scary for most people but I admit I spent a lot of time hiding in a corner. The setup was really neat and it's super engaging, plus the puzzles were a lot of fun. And the clue delivery system they have in place is fantastic.It's probably even more fun if you do have a wimp in your group because I think I provided the Gamemasters as much entertainment as they provided us due to my total state of panic about everything!Will be back when the second room opens!"
