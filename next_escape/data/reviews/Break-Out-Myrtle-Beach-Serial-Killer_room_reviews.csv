A great event for teams or families. Fun time for all. Friendly staff treated us like old friends. Top notch. Highly recommended. We played the ""Serial Killer's House"" find the chainsaw.  Great game!"

There was only 2 of us--my husband and I--who did the Bust a Serial Killer room. It was slightly modified for us because it's made typically for larger groups. It still was challenging, and we needed a few clues when we got stuck, but we got out with minutes to spare. If you ever think of going, don't feel intimated if there's not much people in your party, although it will still be much more fun if you were with a larger group. Try it! Only about 15 min drive from the Myrtle Beach area."

The intense challenge was fantastic and finishing the room with 10 minutes to spare felt very rewarding! My friends and I will certainly be going back for another room very soon and plan to try every new room they create."
