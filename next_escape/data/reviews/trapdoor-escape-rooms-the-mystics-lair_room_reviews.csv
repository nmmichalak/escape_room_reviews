"Escape room ""The Mystic's Lair"" by Trapdoor Escape Rooms in Eugene",https://worldofescapes.com/eugene/quests/trapdoor-escape-rooms-the-mystics-lair,0,I've made it out of both the Mystics Lair and the Toymaker's revenge! Had a blast both times. These guys put so much thought into all of the puzzles. The rooms are clever and challenging and the owners are focused on ensuring it's fun for everyone. Talking it up to everyone I know.

Everything was well thought out, and well spaced. The way things went together was neat, clever; logical but not always obvious. James (the owner) was great and fun to talk with. Will definitely come back for more!"

Jamie and his team are excellent at crafting creative scenarios, concepts and illusions that make you dig deep into your own problem-solving skills & intuitive abilities. To escape the envious Madame Amgine teamwork & attention to detail will set you free!"
