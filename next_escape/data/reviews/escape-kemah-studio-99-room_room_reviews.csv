"Escape room ""Studio 99 Room"" by Escape Kemah in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-kemah-studio-99-room,0,We went with my friends and had such a fun time. The Studio 99 Room was so much fun. Every time we checked off a new thing we were so excited. We plan on going again with more friends. Lots of fun.

Sadly I’ve now done every room so I’ve got to wait and hope they get a new one eventually! I booked their studio 99 room for my birthday and I have to say it’s one of the most fun rooms I’ve ever done! (And I’ve done A LOT of escape rooms lol) The clues were themed incredibly well and they were all so much fun! It’s one of the more challenging rooms I’ve done, we made it out with 11 seconds to spare and probably would not have if we didn’t have as many people as we did. The people at Escape Kemah are amazing! Christina made my birthday really special and I really appreciated it!! If you’re new to escape rooms, I HIGHLY recommend the bomb room. It’s super fun but it’s an easier room and would be a great intro."
"Escape room ""Studio 99 Room"" by Escape Kemah in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-kemah-studio-99-room,2,My daughter had her 14th birthday party at Escape Kemah. The kids all had a fantastic time in the Studio 99 room and they finished it off with a Cool Cow Creamery ice cream sundae bar in the party room. Super easy party for me and my daughter loved it!
