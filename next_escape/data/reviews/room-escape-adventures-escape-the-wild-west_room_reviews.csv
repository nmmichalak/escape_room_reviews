"Escape room ""Escape the Wild West"" by Great Room Escape in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/room-escape-adventures-escape-the-wild-west,0,I had 6 people do the Wild West room and it was a lot of fun. The deputy was great and stayed in character the whole time. My group of outlaws busted our way out of jail. I will definitely be back the next time I am in Columbus.

This was only our second escape room. Mary did an excellent job as our drunk deputy. Excellent and funny staff too! Everything worked and kept us on our toes the whole time. Very exciting! I definitely will be going back to try the other rooms when I'm in the Columbus area again..Thanks for a great time!
