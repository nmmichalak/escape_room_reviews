"Escape room ""The Ventriloquist"" by The Box Escape Experience in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/the-box-escape-experience-ventriloquist,0,"Went on recommendations of others, and am glad we did. Both rooms were great! The Ventriloquist was my favorite, but Cold Case Killer really had a twist unlike I've done. They were my 81st and 82nd rooms, both wins! The entire building and decor were superb and Andy was an amazing host!"
"Escape room ""The Ventriloquist"" by The Box Escape Experience in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/the-box-escape-experience-ventriloquist,1,"I really loved both of their games and the GM/creator was phenomenal! I think my overall favorite was ""The Ventriloquist"" but ""Cold Case Killer"" left the deepest impression on me and had me questioning moralistic concepts several days later. I really think both games need to be played to truly understand the gravity of the other. Bravo for such attention to detail, it was not lost."
