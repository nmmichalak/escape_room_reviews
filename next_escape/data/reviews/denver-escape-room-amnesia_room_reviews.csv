"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Puzzle Effect Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/denver-escape-room-amnesia,2,"We (ages 55,31,26,23,18&18) went to the Denver Escape Room on the way to the airport after spending a week in Colorado. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff was amazing. Josh spent about 10 minutes after our time was up explaining how they set up the rooms etc. Even if you have no clue what an escape room is you should go, you’ll figure it out pretty quickly. I would recommend this place. Perfect for the day of a flight, only 29 minutes from DIA."
