It is truly so fun and you have to really work as a team. I would recommend this for everyone - get your friends and see if you can make it out!

This was our first time to try an escape room. We were not disappointed. We had an amazing time! I love the thought and creativity that is put into the puzzles and story line!

This is definitely going up as one of our favorites in the nation - and we've done 25+ rooms so far! My husband and I did La Famiglia and we can't wait to go back and try the Lost Dutchman's Mine! We love the owners and their enthusiasm for beautiful set design and creative plots.
