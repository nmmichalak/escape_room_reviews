The playground is not to be underestimated. Although, it's a different type of escape room, it is still very much a fun-filled experience for the entire family."

"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-playground,4,"This was my second time doing an escape room, and I was the only one in my party who’d done one before so I had an idea of what to do. We escaped with 3.40 minutes to spare. The game is fairly simple and they’ll give you a rundown on what your group should be looking for based on the theme. You’ll have 3 major hints that you can use throughout the game, and depending on location, you might have a screen to prompt occasional clues as time goes on or the attendant will be there for basic questions. You have the choice to rent out the whole room for your party or you can play with other bookers, which we did. All in all it was great fun! P.S. Always keep an eye out for the time and any hints!"
