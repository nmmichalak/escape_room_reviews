"Escape room ""The Study"" by Nodus 805 Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/nodus-805-escape-rooms-the-study,0,"I have been to probably about a dozen escape rooms so I was really excited to finally have one in Thousand Oaks! We did the Study Room and it did not disappoint. We definitely needed to use my sister for quite a few puzzles but between all us, we only needed one clue and we escaped - I think that's a win! At the end of the room, the theme definitely came full circle so I appreciated the attention to the detail and I would highly recommend this to anyone.However, it doesn't beat my favorite room of all time which is the Great Houdini Escape Room which is actually in San Francisco, so if you're ever in SF you definitely need to go there!"

The Study definitely hit it out of the park. There were some easier puzzles and some harder ones, and it was a clear flow. The guy working there was super friendly and I liked that the room had a story. Can't wait for the new one!"

We all thoroughly enjoyed the challenge and really pulled together to escape from the Study with only 37 seconds to spare. A great bonding exercise.

The puzzles are intelligent and challenging. Alex is amazing - smart, chill, with a real knack for terrific customer service. I love the fact that they built escape games right here in Thousand Oaks. We did The Study and we got out with only 4 minutes to spare! To me, that's perfect - when you think you might not make it because the puzzles are so challenging but you are still able to if you hustle and focus. This is a great room and I would definitely recommend it!"
