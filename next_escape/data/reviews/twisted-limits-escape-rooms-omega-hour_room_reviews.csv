Truly a fun and challenging escape. This was only our 2nd escape adventure, but we were thrilled to pull off another win (with less than 2 minutes left on the clock, on this one). Excited to be the 100th group through this escape room and the 24th to conquer it."

Super friendly staff, a challenging but not frustrating game, and cool game room and snacks to enjoy while you wait for your time. We will definitely be back to try the other room!"
