"Escape room ""Dinner for Two"" by Waco Escape Rooms in Waco",https://worldofescapes.com/waco/quests/waco-escape-rooms-dinner-for-two,0,"I enjoyed doing the Dinner for 2 room! The room was well done with a good price. Sadly, I didn't make it out of the room...maybe because there's more pressure with just 2 people or maybe we were having an off day. First escape room that we have not escaped from! I would like to go back and do another room with a larger group!"

Both were so fun! Didn't escape either time but it was fun working together and get excited when things would work! Totally recommend and we definitely want to go back!
