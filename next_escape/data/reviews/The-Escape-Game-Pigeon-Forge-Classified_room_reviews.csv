"Escape room ""Classified"" by The Escape Game Pigeon Forge in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Escape-Game-Pigeon-Forge-Classified,0,The Escape Game is so much fun and maybe a little stressful for some one us lol. There was 5 of us and we did the Classified Room which was challenging. We made it to the last room and had two clues left to escape. In the end we may had not escaped but we had lots of fun trying. I Can't wait to go back and try the other rooms.
