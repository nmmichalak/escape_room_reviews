By far a fun and unique experience. We had a group of 8 ranging from ages 7-48, the entire group participated and had a ball. This place is run extremely well, the staff is so helpful, intelligent, and eager to make your experience a great one. Shout out to Zach and Malik for making our experience top notch."
