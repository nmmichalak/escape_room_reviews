"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Tewksbury in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escapology-tewksbury-antidote,2,We went to the Tewksbury location as a work outing and it was so much fun. The staff there are very awesome and it was very clean. My team did the Antidote room and it was a lot of fun. We did not get out but want to go back and try again.
