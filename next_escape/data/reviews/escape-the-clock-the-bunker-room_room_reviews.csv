"Escape room ""The Bunker Room"" by Escape the cLock in Garden City",https://worldofescapes.com/garden-city/quests/escape-the-clock-the-bunker-room,2,Had a blast! One of my best friends of many years and I took a few of our teens with us as we were both celebrating our birthdays and we worked together to beat the clock. Great for working together and problem-solving. The hints were not too much but just enough to be helpful!! Nice props in the Bunker Room. Can't wait to go back and do another room!
