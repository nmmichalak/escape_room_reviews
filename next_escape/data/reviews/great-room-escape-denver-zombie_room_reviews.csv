They have to hurry and make more so we can do this every month!

I enjoy a good mystery and this puts your detective skills to the test! The venue was a little hard to find at first (remember, building C-2) but the room was well put-together, and the costuming and make-up was on point. The employees were professional, down-to-earth, and made the experience even better. Plus, I have never encountered a zombie before!I highly recommend this adventure and I hope another story/theme unfolds soon!"

It's hard to find something unique and fun to do as a family and we will definitely be coming back and trying another room.
"Escape room ""Zombie"" by Great Room Escape Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/great-room-escape-denver-zombie,5,"If you need something fun to do with a group of your friends or co-workers, I would highly recommend checking out the Great Room Escape. I booked it for my husband's birthday as a fun, quick -- we were there a little over an hour total - group activity and we were not disappointed. The way they set up the room itself was gave you all of the right thrills and trying to find the puzzles and then work them out was exciting and really fun! We are already planning the next birthday, so we can try the other room!"
"Escape room ""Zombie"" by Great Room Escape Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/great-room-escape-denver-zombie,6,Man was this place awesome!!! Just finished it about 2 hours ago and had my blood pumping the entire time. You're locked in a room with a bunch of people you may or may not have known before tonight and you must use teamwork to solve your way out!!! So many crazy puzzles to try and solve before the killer or zombie get you and only a limited time to do it in. Definitely recommend this to anyone!!! I seriously cant stop thinking about it
