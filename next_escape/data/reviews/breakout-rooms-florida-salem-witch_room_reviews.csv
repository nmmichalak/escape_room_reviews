"Escape room ""Salem witch"" by Storm Out in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/breakout-rooms-florida-salem-witch,0,"My boyfriend and I wanted to do an escape room on a Friday, we've done several before, and we found Code to Escape in Hallendale Beach. We had a great time doing the Salem Witch room on Friday with Game Master Oscar. We then decided on Saturday we wanted to try one of the other five rooms there. Oscar recommended our next room to be the Hangover room so that's what we decided to do. We had a great time doing that room as well. The room was very creative and fun. We can't wait to do the other rooms at this establishment. They were challenging rooms and kept us thinking throughout the entire time period."

Been to a handful of ""rooms"" before but this one added a couple new elements to the experience which I quite appreciated. Strong recommendation!"

The room was set up very well and kept us engaged. Got out with 15 minutes to spare by working together and solving many creative/exciting ""puzzles"". The staff was welcoming and runs a great game!"
