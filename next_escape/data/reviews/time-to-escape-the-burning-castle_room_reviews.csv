"Escape room ""The Burning Castle"" by Time to Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/time-to-escape-the-burning-castle,1,"Time to Escape offers games that use multiple rooms and stand out for their ability to transcend time through immersive design. The puzzles are challenging but not impossible to crack, they fit the theme well, and they keep you running back and forth between rooms for an active, engaging experience. When I played their time-traveling game""80's Flashback,"" I stepped into a bedroom with vintage teal and green carpet and realized we'd be using a boombox to play an actual cassette tape for a clue. It felt totally tubular to be sleuthing our way through the 80's. Time To Escape's other game transported me to 15th century Transylvania where I solved my way through the castle of Vlad the Impaler. This was the first time I'd ever used scent to solve a puzzle, or encountered props as authentic and unusual as a life size armor statue and historically accurate map of Romania."
