"Escape room ""The Treasure of Captain Lockjaw"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-puzzle-room-the-treasure-of-captain-lockjaw,0,"These rooms are fantastic. They are well thought out, challenging, and rewarding. Captain Lockjaw, Madame Lumina, and the Pearled Pachyderm are really great for first timers or experienced puzzle room fans. The Beta Lab room is simply challenging - no antics, no frills, just boxes, locks, and puzzles so I don't recommend it for people looking for the more engaging/ theatrical experience. All in all, we were thrilled with all of these rooms and would gladly revisit if and when a new room is created."
