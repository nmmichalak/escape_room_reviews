"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Escape Experience Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/escape-experience-chattanooga-the-Inheritance,0,"The Inheritance was an excellent challenge and so satisfying to solve. There were plenty of immersive and interactive puzzles as well as a tremendous twist I did not see coming! I've done many other escape rooms across the country and this one was among my favorite. Well done,"

I have to seriously applaud their ingenuity and creativity in the design. While we didn't 'escape,' the experience was so much fun. As a teacher, I see much educational value in these experiences for children and adults (problem solving, creative/critical thinking, etc.). I would whole heartedly recommend this experience to anyone who enjoys puzzles. Highly immersive and profoundly intricate, this is one of the best places for a great time in Chattanooga!"

We had lots of fun, bonded well in teaming, and were quite amazed at the successes we had --- we just needed a bit more time! 5 stars!"
