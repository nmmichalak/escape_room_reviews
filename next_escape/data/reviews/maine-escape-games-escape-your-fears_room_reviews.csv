My family (there were 6 of us) did the Escape Your Fears Room tonight, which is the hardest room. So glad that we chose to do this one! We had a great time and worked really well together. We were allowed to finish and we only went 3 minutes over the time limit. We will definitely be back to do other rooms! Thanks for an amazing experience!"
