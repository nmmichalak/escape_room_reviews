"Escape room ""The Geek Escape"" by Cipher Escape in Morrisville",https://worldofescapes.com/morrisville/quests/Cipher-Escape-The-Geek-Escape,0,"This was the perfect family activity this Christmas. Our family had so much fun working together to figure out the puzzles and ultimately get out of the room. It was the quickest hour, but has left us with days of laughs and memories and something we will talk about for many months to come. We will be back to try our hand at another room!  Thanks Cipher Escape!"

"Escape room ""The Geek Escape"" by Cipher Escape in Morrisville",https://worldofescapes.com/morrisville/quests/Cipher-Escape-The-Geek-Escape,2,"In lieu of Christmas presents this year, my siblings and I, along with our spouses, decided to do an afternoon activity out without our kids (in order to spend some quality time together). There were 6 of us total, so we decided to do the Geek Room. It was so much fun and we worked so well together. We were all able to use our skills to work toward a common goal (even if we didn't even come close to getting out of the room). It was a great bonding experience and we all walked out of there amazed about how much fun we had. Also, the facility was very nice and the staff was very friendly. We can't wait to go again sometime!"
