"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,0,"We've done many escape games and this is one of our favorites! We successfully completed Operation Sabotage. It was fun, surprising and challenging! It was clean and our host was very nice and helpful. One time, a key was shaken out of a lockbox and he reminded us 'you have to unlock the box to get the key,' so he was clearly watching what we were doing. (We weren't trying to cheat. Haha.) It was a great time and we will return to try another game!"

Train Escape has their rooms in train cars and was great for what we were looking for. We had a group of 9 total. The couple at Train Escape managed to have us split into two groups and use both rooms. After talking with them, they told us about a third room they were opening that we would definitely try to come back for."
"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,2,We had so much fun last night! We brought our kids and our niece and we came so close to breaking out of the Sabotage room. The owners were very friendly and made us feel right at home. Derrick even took extra time at the end to show our 4-year-old around the actual train. We are definitely coming back to do the other room!
"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,3,"My group of 4 absolutely loved Sabotage! It was somewhat linear while also leaving a lot of room for exploration of codes. The theme was awesome being smashed into a train car with everyone. It gave a real sense of urgency without having to do much to affect us mentally. There were enough red herrings to keep us going down a rabbit hole or two without overwhelming us with useless items and meaningless clues. It's so hard to gush about the room without giving away hints, but I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find something to dislike about Sabotage! Go try it!"
"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,4,"Sabotage is an excellent room fun, challenging puzzles. The theming was well done and the story was fun, with a logical flow, and some very cool twists. The idea of an escape room in a train is original, and provides a great atmosphere, as the train element is thoroughly executed throughout the game. I recommend for beginners and enthusiasts alike, and I can't wait to go back to play the other room!"
