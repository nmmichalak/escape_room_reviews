"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/breakout-atlanta-operation-casino,2,My husband and I went here for a date. We did the Casino and it was one of the best experiences we've had. Nolan was our game master and he was the best! He was friendly and helped us when we were stuck. Highly recommend this experience and Nolan!

The hosts were great and made us feel very welcome. We had a lunch catered in before the event, as well as drinks/desserts afterward. The rooms themselves were very challenging, and only 1 of our 4 groups was able to escape within the allotted hour. Each room has a host ""monitor"" watching your progress from another room, and offering hints when asked (subject to limits) or when the wheels are spinning. Very interesting to see how we all interact and operate outside of our ""normal"" work environment. We would highly recommend Breakout Games and plan to make this an annual event. "

I'd say the room was a somewhat too challenging for the time allotted and they should let folks keep going beyond the timer if no one else is waiting in line after you (maybe that was an option, but I'm not aware of it).Enjoyed the overall experience though! It was great fun. "
