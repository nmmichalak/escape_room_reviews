"Escape room ""Lunar Escape"" by Mission Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/mission-escapes-lunar-escape,0,"My friends and I love doing escape rooms in AZ so when I was visiting a best friend in Denver we absolutely had to do one with her family. We did the Lunar Escape room and escaped with 4 mins to spare! The puzzles were very clever, we had unlimited hints, and we had a blast! Our GM was very helpful and it'd be fun to go back and try the other escape room!"
