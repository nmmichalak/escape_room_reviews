"Escape room ""Temple of Tikal"" by Total Escape in Winston-Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/winston-salem/quests/total-escape-temple-of-tikal,0,This was my favorite escape I've tried out of 5 different locations in NC. Elaborate and a cool mix of thematic puzzles and effects.
"Escape room ""Temple of Tikal"" by Total Escape in Winston-Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/winston-salem/quests/total-escape-temple-of-tikal,1,"Excellent game. Good variety of puzzles. Challenging and fun. We had a great time! Itâ€™s challenging but in a good way. Doesnt require a large group but could accommodate one (doable with 4 people, only 1 had done escape rooms before). Friendly staff who are clearly passionate about escape rooms. "
