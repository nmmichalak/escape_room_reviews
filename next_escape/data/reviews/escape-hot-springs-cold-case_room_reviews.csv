Thanks to our hostess, we were able to find our way through all the clues, locks and mind benders to finally solve the case and escape the room with 7 seconds left! This is something everyone should try... so much fun! Teamwork and communication required. Take your friends to Escape Hot Springs to have a very unique and interesting time! "
