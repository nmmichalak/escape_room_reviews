"Escape room ""The Neighbor"" by TrappedKC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/trappedkc-the-neighbor,0,"The Neighbor room was good.  I was frustrated with the fact that they do not tell you, before you start, that if you don't get out, you will not be told what you missed.  Our worker told us we were about 3/4 the way finished.  If we would have known that we would not be told how to achieve the goal, we would've asked for more clues during the hour. Very frustrated with the ending experience."
"Escape room ""The Neighbor"" by TrappedKC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/trappedkc-the-neighbor,1,"Very disappointed with the experience my family and I had. We were given no background info about what we were trying to find in our room, The Neighbor. The room itself was tiny with paper thin walls. We could hear all the traffic in the waiting room/lobby.We felt it was just a room full of locks. Over ten locks with no rhyme or reason for each one. Just felt like a terrible array of puzzle after puzzle that led to nothing, just another lock with another clue for something new. Nothing was explained as to why each puzzle was there and the purpose. We had opened ALL the locks and still didnâ€™t know what we were trying to figure out.I really wanted to like this place knowing how awesome the prices were but the whole experience was disappointing. Poor staffing, lackluster puzzles and terrible room design. I have been to 5 different escape rooms in The KC-Metro area and this is by far the worst."
