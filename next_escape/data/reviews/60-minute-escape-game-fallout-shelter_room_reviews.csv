We had so much fun, and the owners were so nice. We are visiting from out of state, but we will make sure to make a special trip back to play their other room. They did a great job on interactive props and gameplay! Loved it!"

Great family activity, lots of fun. We didn't escape the first time, but we got it the 2nd. Hopefully, more rooms added soon so we can come back again!"

The room was decorated amazingly, it definitely added to the ambiance of the experience. The puzzles were very tricky and creative. I highly recommend this place to anyone. The bigger the group the better. Will definitely be back to try out the Pharoah room."

We had a 'blast', though unfortunately we were destroyed in the blast during the last puzzle! Definitely going to try again sometime! I will totally recommend this to others."
