"Escape room ""The Complex"" by Jackson Escape Rooms in Jackson",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksoj/quests/Jackson-Escape-Rooms-Detention,0,"I did The Complex: Part 1 with my two sons. As its name states, the room was very complex indeed! It was hands down the hardest escape room we have ever done, but we were successful with 3 minutes to spare. Waiting on Part 2 with baited breath. A fun family afternoon!"

Loved improvements and had a blast today! Super accommodating to our incredibly late family, and even let part of our group whose car had broken down on the way come back later in the day! Love this place and cannot wait to come try another room soon! Also, they were crazy awesome with scheduling our private booking, and very easy to work with!"
