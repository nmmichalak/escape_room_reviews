"Escape room ""Minervaâ€™s Return"" by Decode Detroit in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/decode-detroit-minervas-return,0,"This was our third escape room and it was incredibly fun. Two in our group had done Part 1, so we did Part 3 and it was no trouble even for those of us who hadn't done the beginning. There was something for everyone to do, including our 12-year-old, and the puzzles were challenging - it took a real team effort. I would definitely recommend this experience to anyone!"
