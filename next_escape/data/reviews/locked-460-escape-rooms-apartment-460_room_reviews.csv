It was so much fun!We had 5 in our group and everyone worked together to solve the Apartment Escape. We were told that this was the hardest room to solve.

My friends and I choose to try the hardest room available, Apartment 460, and we were not disappointed! Our game master was helpful but didn't hold our hand the whole time which allowed us to really use our detective skills. I would definitely suggest choosing Locked 460 if you desire a challenging but fun time!"
"Escape room ""Apartment 460"" by Locked 460 Escape Rooms in Grand Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-rapids/quests/locked-460-escape-rooms-apartment-460,4,I love doing escape rooms and Locked 460 did not disappoint! We ended up doing 2 rooms and they were both fantastic. Wanted had a great western atmosphere and Apartment 460 had the right amount of suspense and creepiness. Thanks Stevie and the management for making our first experience at Locked 460 an awesome one! We will definitely be back to try Infiltrate!
