It was tons of fun!!! Much harder than the rooms we've done before, but we still made it out and had a good time. Josh was an excellent games master! We'll definitely be back next time we're in town."

Even though we were so close we still had a blast. Love how our group in the beginning refuses to ask for clues but the game master kept giving it to is anyways lol. She said that she had to keep giving us clues even though we never asked for it lol. Also, love how its unlimited clues! Will have to try this again but with a different room!"
