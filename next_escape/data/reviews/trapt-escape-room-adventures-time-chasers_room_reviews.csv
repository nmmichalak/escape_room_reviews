"Escape room ""Time Chasers: Race for the Cure"" by trap't Escape Room Adventures in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/trapt-escape-room-adventures-time-chasers,0,"Our group of eight recently took on the most difficult room at Trap't and had a blast. The room design was pretty amazing, really transporting you, and all the puzzles were very clever, and lots of fun! This was our second trip here and it did not disappoint. The staff here are also wonderful - very helpful, friendly, etc. Overall great experience."
