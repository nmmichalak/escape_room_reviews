"Escape room ""DaVinci's Office"" by Southern Pines Escape in Southern Pines",https://worldofescapes.com/southern-pines/quests/southern-pines-escape-davinchis-office,0,"My husband and I really enjoyed Southern Pines Escape. The owners are super nice and the decor of the place is wonderful. We played DaVinci's Office. The puzzles were all very unique and challenging. We didn't make it out, but we had a great time trying! We will definitely be back to attempt their other rooms!"
"Escape room ""DaVinci's Office"" by Southern Pines Escape in Southern Pines",https://worldofescapes.com/southern-pines/quests/southern-pines-escape-davinchis-office,1,We absolutely had a BLAST doing the DaVinci Room. Had a group of 7 and each and everyone of us played an important part in getting as far as we did. First time for all of us but definitely not our last time. The owners were wonderful and made our experience even that much better. Can't say enough great things about the Southern Pines Escape.
