We were extremely engaged, entertained and challenged throughout our hour of fun. My kids have been begging to go back for more!The second visit I made to the Word Mania room was with a group of friends for a ""date night."" We set out to complete the advanced version. Our group enjoyed many laughs and an abundance of suspense. Our money and time was well spent."
