"Escape room ""The Interrogation Room"" by Cold War Escape Room in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/cold-war-escape-room-the-interrogation-room,0,"We did Interrogation Room and never having done an escape room had no idea what to expect. We had so much fun and it was such a challenge. The owner was nice and so helpful. As a former Army vet - he knows all about the Cold War although he is young. You will definitely be challenged but have loads of fun. If we return to area, we will return here to try another room."
