William (Will. I. Am.) was an awesome guide, very entertaining.We did The Epicurean, the easiest room. There was a ton to do for our team of eight. It was a very creative room, less of an escape and more a treasure hunt, which is a neat difference.One of the things we love about this type of entertainment is the interactivity. Your group is often paired with people you don't know so you get to meet new people. It makes for a unique experience."

It's a very nice facility. The employees are very friendly and knowledgeable. They make sure you are set up for success! I did the Epicurean with my husband and brother and sister-in-law. We would have benefited from having another pair or two, but we did just fine by pairing up and tackling the game."

They walk you through the escape room process and it was a great brain teasing process. The management was very professional and knowledgeable. We all had a great time and appreciate the above and beyond service we received.
