"Escape room ""The Attic of Abigail Falkirk"" by The Conundrum in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/The-Conundrum-The-Attic-of-Abigail-Falkirk,0,"So far the best room in Asheville. The puzzles were great, but the most impressive thing was the atmosphere. More than any other escape room, this one made you feel like you were actually in a real place as opposed to just a made up room. When the guide was in character, something that no place else I've been to yet has."

Abigail's Attic was a perfectly planned haunted theme room! The staff at Conundrum is wonderful and we just couldn't get over the detail and atmosphere. Everything about our experience was top-notch! Can't wait to go again and take a group of family and friends!

The puzzles were many and varied and the theme was really well portrayed, including our great host ""Ambrose"" who kept us on point. Highly recommend escaping with the Conundrum! Thank you!"

The room and atmosphere were awesome. The puzzles really made you and your group think. I would love to try the brewery next time I'm in town. We did manage to escape with 8mins left, but it was well worth it!!!"
