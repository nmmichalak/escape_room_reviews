"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Escape Games PDX in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escape-games-pdx-amnesia,1,I've done the Amnesia room and today our group from work did this again. I did Portlandia this time. This is a lot of fun and is great for team building. The staff is very friendly and professional. I highly recommend this for everyone and hope we get to do this again in the future.
