"Escape room ""Bad Moon Rising!"" by Saginaw Escape in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/saginaw-escape-bad-moon-rising,0,"It was fun! Detailed and challenging, but not too challenging that it took the fun away from the game. We made it out with a few seconds to spare, my family had such a good time. We are going back for the other rooms"
