I have almost never had so much fun! We had to do the next two rooms right then and there, and spent the rest of the afternoon having a blast.The staff was courteous, the scenarios and equipment-use creative, and our Game Master seemed to be having as much fun as we were.I can't say enough great things about our experience at Escapology!!!"

Offering us water multiple times. The Budapest room was hard but so much fun! Would definitely recommend! Can't wait to come back and do another.

During my trip to San Diego, this was one of my favorite escape rooms. The attention to detail and immersion was outstanding. More importantly, the staff here delivers some of the best customer service in the industry. The games are great and the puzzles are clearly tied to the theme. If you are a beginner, novice, or expert, this is the place to go for your escape room adventure."

First time that we'd tried something like this and I surprised my bf for his bday by taking him to do the Budapest Express. The game master was helpful and we can't wait to go back and try the other storylines.

Started out with Antidote and game master Augustus was extremely helpful to my group of rookies. We loved his sense of humor and his desire to see us succeed. We enjoyed him and the game so much that we immediately signed up to do Budapest Express. Having just completed Antidote we knew exactly what was necessary to tackle Budapest and we executed our plan flawlessly. We finished that escape with 9 minutes to spare. The ""who done it"" feel of Budapest was very exciting. I would recommend this to all of my friends and family."
