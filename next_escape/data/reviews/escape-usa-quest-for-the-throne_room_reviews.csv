"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Escape USA in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-usa-quest-for-the-throne,0,"This was a last minute choice to enjoy some quality time with some freinds...and it was GREAT! We chose to do the ""Quest for the Throne"" room. It was VERY challenging, but all four of us contributed and managed to get out with 12 minutes left on the one hour clock. The game was very exciting, adrenaline pumping and a great ""bang for your buck"". I HIGHLY recommend this place."

The staff is friendly and very helpful. Iâ€™ve done other escape rooms, but was pleasantly surprised to find one located in Douglasville. We did the Quest for the Throne. It was challenging and a lot of fun. We did escape, but we cannot wait to go back to try the other rooms."

Loved both of them! While I only escaped once both rooms were a ton of fun and kept you thinking through the whole 60 minutes! I highly recommend!"
