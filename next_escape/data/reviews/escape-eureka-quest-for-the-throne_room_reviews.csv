The room was pretty challenging; our group of 6 didn't quite make it in one hour. It was super fun and I'd love to go back and try their other room options!

"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Escape Eureka in Eureka",https://worldofescapes.com/eureka/quests/escape-eureka-quest-for-the-throne,2,"Highly recommend! It was so much fun. My friends and I tried the Throne room, all the puzzles were very well thought out and some of them definitely took some time to think through. We will definitely be back to try the other room and hope that more rooms will open up in the future. "
