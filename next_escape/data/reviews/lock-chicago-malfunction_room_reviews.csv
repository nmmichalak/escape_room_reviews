"Escape room ""Malfunction"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-malfunction,0,"My wife and I are enthusiasts and have done about 30 rooms throughout Chicago so we figured we'd explore Evanston and some of the outlying suburbs. Lock Chicago did not disappoint! The puzzles and theme were spot on and the employees working were very helpful and friendly. We liked how Malfunction had two different options to ""win"" and while we didn't complete the entire room we did just enough to get on their wall of champions! Thanks Lock Chicago for a fun time and definitely recommend checking these guys out for anyone in the area. Close proximity to Northwestern and the public transit so was easy for us to find their facility. "
"Escape room ""Malfunction"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-malfunction,1,One of our favorite escape rooms in the Chicago area! We actually went and did Malfunction in Lock Chicago's original space when they first opened in Evanston and were amazed at the new changes they made to update it. The staff and owners were kind enough to invite us in and give us a tour of the new facility. My family and I are Escape Room fanatics and look forward to doing their newest room soon!

We did the Malfunction room - it was really challenging for us to even get started).The staff are kind, the space is clean - I especially appreciated the jellybean dispenser in the front.I'm going to take off one star entirely for aesthetics of the room - it is very rustic looking as if a high school group had built it for a fundraiser.But other than that - I'd go back in a heartbeat because of the pure mental challenge provided."

It was surprisingly different compared to their Sunburn escape room and great for team building.
