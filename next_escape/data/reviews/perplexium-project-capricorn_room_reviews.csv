"Escape room ""Project Capricorn"" by Perplexium in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/perplexium-project-capricorn,0,"Took the whole family (my wife, our 10-yr-old and I) and we had a great time. Very well thought out and very cool use of technology. All three of us were able to solve puzzles and the overall effect was super cool."
"Escape room ""Project Capricorn"" by Perplexium in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/perplexium-project-capricorn,1,"Perplexium is where our puzzle room addiction originates. We've beat both Rogue AI and Project Capricorn. I'd definitely recommend having more players for Rogue AI, but we did fine with just three players for Project Capricorn. Next up, we're planning on going for the record in the Spy room!"
