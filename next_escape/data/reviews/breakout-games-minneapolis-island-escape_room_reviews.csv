They have a wide selection of rooms and we their island scenario. Our Game Master was Lizzy and she did an excellent job on hints and technical help that did just enough to keep us moving while still letting us control the pace.The phrase escape room can be a bit misleading as the event we did was a series of a puzzles not directly related to an escape. Still required thinking and teamwork, just be clear what you looking for.We had a lot of fun. If I was in Minneapolis for more than two days I'd definitely go through all of their rooms."
