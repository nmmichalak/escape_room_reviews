I have been to other escape based venues in the Orlando area and this superseded by far. We were greeted by the owner, Lee and he gave us the background of escape games which I found very interesting. The rooms are too notch, challenging and very fun. We had so much fun yesterday, we are patiently waiting for them to open to go back again today! This is a definite must do!!!"

When we first walked in the tiny little room, I couldn't believe we were supposed to find a huge diamond in such a small room.
