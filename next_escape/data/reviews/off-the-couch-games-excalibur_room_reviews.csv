"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Off The Couch Games in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/off-the-couch-games-excalibur,0,"A friend and I recently visited the Excalibur room and also sampled the VR experience at Off The Couch. We had an absolutely phenomenal time. I've done a few escape rooms in the past, and this one by far had the highest attention to detail and innovative puzzles. Additionally this was the first ""extended"" room I've done and it really felt like a complete experience. I would recommend this room to groups of any size."
"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Off The Couch Games in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/off-the-couch-games-excalibur,1,STAFF WAS SO NICE AND EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!!! Remember to check in for a free drink too! There were so many things to do in the lobby we never got bored! Excited to go do the rest of the rooms. We did Excalibur and it was so fun and different compared to the rest of the other escape rooms I've done!

I have done over 15 escape rooms, mostly in the Bay Area, but also in Los Angeles, and the Excalibur room here is one of the best I have experienced anywhere. Amazingy immersive, the hosts are great, and the puzzles are truly integrated into the environment. It was an awesome experience, highly recommended."
