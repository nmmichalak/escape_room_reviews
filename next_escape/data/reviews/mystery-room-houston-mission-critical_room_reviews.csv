"Escape room ""Mission Critical"" by Mystery Room Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/mystery-room-houston-mission-critical,1,"This was a first-time adventure for my husband and me, as we figured what better way to celebrate our wedding anniversary than to test our patience with one another. We initially booked Helter Skelter, but due to unanticipated circumstances (unrelated to the business or employees), we were offered the option to switch to Mission Critical. We loved every minute of it! The staff here is incredibly friendly, welcoming, and genuinely invested in customer satisfaction and enjoyment. We couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience! We thoroughly enjoyed every minute and cannot wait to travel back to Houston and take another stab at Helter Skelter with some of our friends. Thank you Mystery Room Staff for the awesome time! Youâ€™ve definitely helped us find a new hobby! ðŸ˜Š"

We did the Mission Critical (intermediate) and it was very challenging. Will definitely be returning for the other challenges.
