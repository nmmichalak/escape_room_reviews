We did the hardest room, and almost beat it! We were running a little late but they were really understanding about it. I highly recommend this place for anyone who likes these kinds of games and wants to try it in real life."
"Escape room ""Framed"" by Cipher Seeker Room Escape Challenge in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/cipher-seeker-framed,1,My fianc√© and I just finished the Framed room. It was amazing! Dave was so nice and did an awesome job with the room set up. It made us feel completely submerged in the experience. If I was able to give this 10 stars I would! We can't wait to go back and try the other rooms soon.
