"Escape room ""In a Galaxy Far Away"" by Great Escape Delaware in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/great-escape-delaware-in-a-galaxy-far-away,4,"We took my son and three of his friends today for his 8th birthday celebration and of course did the Star Wars room. Knowing how difficult the rooms can be, we warned the boys that we probably wouldn't solve the puzzle in time. But our game master Joey was amazing! They adjusted the room for the kids and he gave us an insane amount of clues anytime the boys asked or he could see we were stuck. We all know there is no way that we would have unlocked the door without all of his help. Needless to say, I have a very happy birthday boy who cannot wait to go back and try another room! Thank you Joey for an amazing adventure! We will be back!"
