"Escape room ""The List"" by Expedition Escape in Montgomeryville",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomeryville/quests/expedition-escape-the-list,0,"I went with one of my friends and we had a great time! We both have never done this kind of thing before, but this will certainly not be our last. Emily was such an amazing guide. She was so nice and friendly, and provided clues when needed without being overbearing. I would definitely recommend The List room for everyone, even those with kids. I look forward to trying more rooms!"
