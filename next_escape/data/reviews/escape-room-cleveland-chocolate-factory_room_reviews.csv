"Escape room ""Chocolate Factory"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-chocolate-factory,0,"8 of us tried to escape the Chocolate Factory Room. We were so close but did not make it out. We had a blast and all of us keep saying while we rehash the defeat (we aren't taking it well, haha), ""the next time we go...[insert strategy here]."" We can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!The chocolate factory room had so many fun puzzles that many people could help with. The only issue we had was that there were a few times we had solved the clue but didn't hear/see that the next step had opened. We wish there was a sound to let us know something happened because we wasted time thinking we were wrong. So, if you're doing the chocolate factory, when you go to try a solution to the clue, everyone be quiet and listen for something to happen. Overall, awesome time. We will be back!"

We all agreed we would go back in the near future to try the room again!! Check it out ... you wont be disappointed !!
