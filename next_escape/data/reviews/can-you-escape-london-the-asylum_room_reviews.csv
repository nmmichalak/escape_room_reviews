"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Can You Escape in London",https://worldofescapes.com/london/quests/can-you-escape-london-the-asylum,0,"This was my third escape game but first time to this location. We did the Asylum, by far, the absolute best one I've been to and can not wait to go back! We took my mom for her 51st birthday and it was her first time to any escape room, she absolutely loved it! And letâ€™s not forget the staff! Nicest and most personable place you will go and get the best experience hands down!"
