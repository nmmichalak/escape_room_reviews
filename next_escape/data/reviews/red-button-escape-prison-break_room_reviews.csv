"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Button Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/red-button-escape-prison-break,0,"After doing 40+ escape rooms, I can honestly say the rooms at Red Button are easily in my top three favorites from the complexity and variety of the puzzles to the build-outs and vibe of each room! They definitely made the decor as important as the puzzles! I highly recommend!! Can’t wait till Mayan opens!"

They’re so well thought and I’m still impressed and think everyone needs to try it. It’s very fun, especially for teens. We escaped with 11 minutes left. Cancel all your plans next weekend and book a room with your family or friends because you won’t regret it."
