"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-conspiracy,0,We did this room with 7 people. Two were strangers and 3 were newbie. We escaped with 28min left. This is not as challenging as indicated. It is very linear. We enjoyed it but it was a bit easy for us.

It was super fun, but I think eight is much too many people. I'd recommend a group of four max, two for a challenge."

The decorations for the conspiracy theme were on point and enhanced the puzzles in clever ways. The puzzles themselves were also unique enough.
