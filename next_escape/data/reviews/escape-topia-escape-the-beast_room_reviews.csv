"Escape room ""Escape the Beast"" by Escape-topia in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-topia-escape-the-beast,0,SO much fun!! Nobody in our group of 4 has ever done an escape room before. We loved it and had a blast! Kraig was awesome and made it a really great experience for us! Highly recommend. We did the Beast room.
"Escape room ""Escape the Beast"" by Escape-topia in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-topia-escape-the-beast,1,Kraig was the best host ever! We had a group of 10 and escaped the Beast (barely!) family fun but great for all!

Right when you walk in you are immersed in the feel of a spooky hotel and it's so well designed and decorated. The warm-up puzzles and the puzzles in the room were very challenging and it was satisfying when you could figure them out! Unfortunately, we couldn't Escape the Beast but we will return to Escape some Zombies!"
"Escape room ""Escape the Beast"" by Escape-topia in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-topia-escape-the-beast,3,Very cool room and interesting puzzles! I love the whole haunted/spooky hotel room theme from the Escape the Beast room. One of the best escape rooms I've done so far! Very detailed and challenging. Friendly staff and nice decorations. Will be back to do the zombies!!!
