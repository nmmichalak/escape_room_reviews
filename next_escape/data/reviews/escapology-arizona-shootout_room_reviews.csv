Was made to feel welcomed as soon as we arrived.  We did the Arizona shootout, it was so much fun. I love the team building aspect and the interaction. Can't wait to return for another game. It's a must when in Vegas."
"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-arizona-shootout,1,I was in Vegas for a business trip and we attended Escapology as a team building activity. We did the Arizona shoot-out room. This is my second escape room and it a lot of fun. We were a 5 person team and I think that was perfect for the room. We escaped with 12 minutes left on the clock.I would highly recommend Escapology and I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas. Check it out. You won't be disappointed.
