"Escape room ""The Uptown Murder"" by The Escape Tulsa in Tulsa",https://worldofescapes.com/tulsa/quests/The-Escape-Tulsa-The-Uptown-Murder,0,We had a great time. 3 adults and 3 kids ages 9-13. We selected Uptown Murder room since it was our first escape room experience. It was great that the younger kids still got to productively participate. We finished with 25 minutes left. I would definitely recommend this room if you have children with you.
