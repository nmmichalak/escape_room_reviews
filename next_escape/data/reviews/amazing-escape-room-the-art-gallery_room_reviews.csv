"Escape room ""The Art Gallery"" by Amazing Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-art-gallery,0,"What a great concept for those who are looking for an activity that not only challenges the mind, but also your ability to work with others. While, my party consisted of 8 individuals, there were more than enough clues to keep everyone busy and contribute to the main goal of escaping within 60 minutes. We did the Art Gallery room. The clues were challenging enough to warrant players to think outside the box, yet streamlined in such a way that keeps the player pigeonholed in the right direction. You are allowed three hints if you are stuck, but not to worry because if you ever need more, the game master requires the party to ""pay up"" in song or dance or other laughable acts. Overall the environment or the game room is active and fun. Would love to try out the other two options."

We weren't able to make it out of the room, but we had a really good time. I would come back if I could. My only complaint is that some of the colors for a certain puzzle were off, but that was the one puzzle. I recommend going here if you like puzzles and math and wanna have a good time with friends."
