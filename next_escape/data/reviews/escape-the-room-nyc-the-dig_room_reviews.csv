We didn't make it out but had a ball and we are already planning our next visit. Lastly, the staff was friendly and very accommodating!"

But everyone not only enjoyed themselves, we couldn't stop talking about it! I recommend you try this at least once, I am sure you'll be back to try another themed room, like we are!"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-the-dig,4,"Overall fun, but I need to dock rating on 2 big points.We got stuck 20 minutes on a broken electric switch puzzle. We actually solved this correctly but a light was broken and not giving us a light bulb response for completion.The room was also missing an important puzzle piece in the setup! We had 2 copies of one piece of paper rather than an answer key and another paper to decipher it.When the guide came in explain he blew off the broken puzzle and missing paper (although he tested and did confirm that the electric switch puzzle was broken and that we should have found the paper in an empty spot that was opened)."
