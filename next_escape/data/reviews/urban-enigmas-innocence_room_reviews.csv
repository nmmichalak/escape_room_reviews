"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,1,That was the best hour ever! We opted not to prove our innocence and escape as fugitives.

It was so fun and well-thought out. The room was challenging but still solvable and we had a great time doing it! Even when we were waiting to go, the employees had us playing games that were hilarious and time flew by! So creative and would highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,3,I've been here twice and both times it was a lot of fun! I did Innocence with one other person and Dorm Room Daze with a group and both times were great. I would recommend it to anyone! The rooms are very complex and we were all impressed with the amount of detail put into them. The owner/ employees were very nice as well!

We have done about a dozen other escape rooms, and this one is one of the best if not the best we've ever done.The puzzles were challenging enough to flex your creative problem solving and logical thinking skills, without being overly difficult. They've really succeeded in creating a fun atmosphere and story that you can jump into for an hour.We stayed to chat with the owner, AJ, for a while after we finished the room, and he was super friendly.This is absolutely worth every penny and we will be back soon to do their other rooms!"
