"Escape room ""Code Back Slash"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-code-back-slash,0,I've been to most if not all of the escape rooms in DFW and this is one of the best ones yet! There's a professional look to the place as you go in. The room I did (Code Back Slash) had a great story and was original. They have a hidden challenge which allows you to win a free go at another room which is a touch of genius I have not seen before! Can't wait to do the next room!
"Escape room ""Code Back Slash"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-code-back-slash,1,Excellent experience. Had a blast with a group of four (ages 13-33). We did the hacker-themed room. Our game master was extremely friendly and helpful. She didn't give anything away but was able to nudge us in the right direction if we needed it. Will be visiting again soon!

I've done two rooms so far, Code Back Slash and Nuclear Shuttle, and we got out of both with time to spare. The staff is great, very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend this escape room!"

My wife and I took our 24-year-old, 12-year-old, and 10-year-old daughters to do the Code Backslash room and we all had a blast! Everyone got involved and really loved the experience! We were worried that the little ones might not enjoy it, but they were big contributors to the group. Awesome fun for all age groups!"
