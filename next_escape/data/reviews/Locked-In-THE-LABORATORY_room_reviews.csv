"Escape room ""The Laboratory"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-LABORATORY,0,I love escape rooms I've done tons in Los Angeles and came here with my family in Alabama. It's worth it! The puzzles for the lab are challenging and the people are great!
"Escape room ""The Laboratory"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-LABORATORY,1,"Really enjoyed our game. We did the Laboratory and while we were close, we didn't make it out. Game was fun, and really challenging. Would recommend the Warehouse first then work your way up through the tougher difficulties. We will be back to finish the other two rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Laboratory"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-LABORATORY,2,We were in town for a gymnastics competition and decided to try this. There were 4 adults and 4 teenage girls in our group. We had a blast. So much fun. We did the laboratory room. We escaped with 2 minutes and 10 seconds left!

We did the lab which has a 33% success rate. The timer started and we all went in different directions, each working on something different but ending up helping each other through problems. Finished with 14:41 to spare. It was challenging but totally fun. Can't wait to do the other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Laboratory"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-LABORATORY,4,"Oh, so close!Visiting from Pennsylvania, and our hosts made reservations for the Laboratory. I'm thinking, ""there's an hour of my life I'll never get back."" Boy, was I wrong!This was SO much fun! It was a challenge both to get the clues, but also to work cooperatively! Academic intelligence isn't necessarily a necessity to make it through in time, but being able to converse is essential!I'm looking forward to returning and trying to make it out of another room."
