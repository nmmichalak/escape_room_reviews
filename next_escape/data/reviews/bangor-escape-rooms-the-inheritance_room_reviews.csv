"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Bangor Escape Rooms in Bangor",https://worldofescapes.com/bangor/quests/bangor-escape-rooms-the-inheritance,0,Our group of 5 did The Inheritance room. Highly recommended for a team building experience. James was very accommodating opening on his day off for us. We escaped with a few seconds to spare.

My wife and I went with 6 of our friends, and the room had so many clues that we all were able to be involved. The Inheritance Room was challenging, but with teamwork, we made it through. The price is affordable, the staff is friendly, and we will definitely be back!"
