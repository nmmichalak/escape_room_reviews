"Escape room ""Hang ‘Em High"" by Try-N-Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/try-n-escape-hang-em-high,0,"We had an amazing experience yesterday. We did the Hang 'em High room. It was challenging, fun and full of surprises! The four of us escaped just in time and cannot wait to go back to try Sara's Got a Secret. Jason was a fantastic host and made us feel welcome. Thank you!"
"Escape room ""Hang ‘Em High"" by Try-N-Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/try-n-escape-hang-em-high,1,I have been to several escape rooms in the past few months with my family. We have been enjoying each and every escape room. This room 'hang em high' was very challenging. Jason explained the instructions to us and set our 60 minutes. We were off. This was one of the best rooms ever. Really had to put on our thinking caps. We finished with 16 minutes on the clock. It was awesome. Can't wait to go back for the next challenging room. Thanks Jason!!

We did the Hang em High room and ALMOST got out in time. We should have brought more people for brain power. This place is a must if you're in Boca Raton.
