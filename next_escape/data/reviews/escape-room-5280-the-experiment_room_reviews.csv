"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Escape Room 5280 in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-room-5280-the-experiment,0,"This was my first escape room experience, so I don't know how Room 5280 compares to the area's other escape rooms, but I had a lot of fun. I went with a few of my co-workers as a team building event and did ""The Experiment"" room. It was challenging but not enough to make the experiencing too frustrating. We had 7 people in the group and there were times where some of us did not have anything to do because we were stuck on one particular locks, but in general we had to collaborate on most of the locks. You had to go through a lot of different mediums and equipment, which made the experience stimulating. Definitely something I'd like to try again."

We are glad we did, the owner was super friendly and the room, ""Experiment"" was a total blast. Sometimes in other escape rooms it feels like it's a stretch to figure out the clues or puzzles, but not here. The puzzles were fun and challenging. Long story short we a had a very good time and all 6 of us would easily recommend room 5280 in Raleigh, to anyone."

We had so much fun. I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms. We did The Experiment and laughed at ourselves a lot. One piece of advice...don't overthink it.
