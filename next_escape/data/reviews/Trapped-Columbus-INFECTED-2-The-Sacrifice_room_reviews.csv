"Escape room ""CAMPED! The Hairy Truth"" by Trapped Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/Trapped-Columbus-INFECTED-2-The-Sacrifice,0,"Went here with my work crew--12 of us total. It was awesome. We didn't win (we were sooooo close). Everyone in my group raved about how fun it was.The clues were challenging, but doable. Different people on my team worked together at different times to solve clues, and it was a great team building experience.We did have a zombie in the room; he added a TON of pressure, but we really enjoyed it."
