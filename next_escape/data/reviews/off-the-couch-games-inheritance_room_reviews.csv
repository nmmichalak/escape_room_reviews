"Escape room ""Inheritance: Tesla's Secret"" by Off The Couch Games in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/off-the-couch-games-inheritance,0,"We had a really great time at Off The Couch! We did Inheritance and that was just the right level for our group. The setup and clues were challenging and fun! I highly recommend going with the story mode to ease the stress of escaping. Thanks to the ""Off The Couch"" crew for there cool fun vibe!"

Everyone in our group had done escape rooms, but none of us felt competent. We decided to do the inheritance and they assured us that we would be ok.  They were right. It was so fun, relying on each other to solve clues. It really revealed how clever my friends are. Ha ha ha...we finished in 51 minutes. We will be back!!"
"Escape room ""Inheritance: Tesla's Secret"" by Off The Couch Games in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/off-the-couch-games-inheritance,2,"While not as technologically oriented as escape rooms from omescape, this room is very well themed and the finale was extraordinarily creative. Some of the puzzles are a little straightforward in terms of what you're supposed to do but not in actually solving them. There is a lot of construction in the lobby but it's easily overlooked. "
