"Escape room ""Ehrlich's Manor"" by Amazing Escape Room Cherry Hill in Collingswood",https://worldofescapes.com/collingswood/quests/amazing-escape-room-ch-ehrlichs-manor,0,"Been wanting to do this room for awhile, and now I have.No lie, this room was definitely done in the dark the entire time. Although the room was dark, it wasn’t as scary as I thought it would be. But all that said, it was a great experience along with my group.We escaped with 2 minutes to spare. The room and clues were extremely  challenging but our guide Matt was excellent at giving hints.The only negative comment I have on this room is no air conditioning. But other than that, I recommend trying this room if you’re up for a challenge."
