"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,0,"Just had a great time escaping the Alice in Wonderland room. By far the best escape room I've done so far. The owner was super nice and friendly. We trusted other reviews for this specific place and it was fun. The decor was excellent and all the features worked, nothing was broken or not working as it should. We were able to really get lost in the game and dice into it. Definitely recommend this place and the Alice room"
"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,1,We booked our Escape Room experience this afternoon; we chose Alice's Dream. We had so much fun! I love the setup in each room - super cute! Totally Alice in Wonderland theme. We find the puzzles & riddles challenging. You don't have to know anything about Alice in Wonderland to solve the puzzles. Christina was super nice & friendly;she gave us clues to help us move along & not get stuck.  She said she does not penalize us if we ask for help; what matters is we have fun. We would come back here again & try out other escape rooms. And their restrooms are super clean which is important to me & what I always like in a business.
"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,2,I brought my family here for my parents' and little sister's first time doing an escape room and we all had an incredible time! I was always worried my parents might get frustrated or not really understand what's going on but Alice's Dream is really family friendly and great for all levels. Barry and his wife did such an amazing job into the production of the escape room - it really felt like we were in Alice's dream from Alice in Wonderland! I will say that nothing is actually frightening but I did scream multiple times when things would open up but that's just me being me LOL I would 100% recommend this place to everyone!
