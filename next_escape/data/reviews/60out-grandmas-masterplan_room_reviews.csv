"Escape room ""Grandma's Masterplan"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-grandmas-masterplan,0,"60Out Escape rooms are A1! Very immersive, clever puzzles and the staff are super accommodating - specially VICTORIA! She was a dope game master! All the rooms in this location are really fun but Grandma's Master Plan was my favorite! 6/5!"
"Escape room ""Grandma's Masterplan"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-grandmas-masterplan,1,"This is in my top five rooms. It is a 75-minute room because there is quite a lot to do. Unless you are a seasoned vet of escape rooms, this is a room you need a bigger group for, for sure, because there's just way too much stuff to do for two people. I went with a group of five and had an excellent time. The items you find might not be useful right when you find them but everything has a place in the story, I promise! They put a lot of thought into the storyline and the room definitely corresponds with the narrative they give. I found myself thinking, ""Granny is such a hoot!"" The end of this room is really fun."

It was very challenging, but so much fun. They did a really good job with making you feel like you were PART of the story."
"Escape room ""Grandma's Masterplan"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-grandmas-masterplan,3,I just recently went here with coworkers (6 of us total) and we successfully escaped Grandma's Master Plan although it was very challenging! Two of us had done escape rooms before but the rest were all new. Everyone LOVED the experience and we are already talking about doing another one. The puzzles went well with the theme and the decor was great.

They are a little expensive compared to some of the other rooms in LA but absolutely worth it, no question. The spaces are nice, just make sure you arrive early to find parking. The people that assist you are also all friendly and helpful. "
