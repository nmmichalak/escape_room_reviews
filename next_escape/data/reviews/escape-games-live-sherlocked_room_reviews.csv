"Escape room ""Sherlock's Office"" by Escape Games Live in York",https://worldofescapes.com/york/quests/escape-games-live-sherlocked,0,"This was our family's first time and we loved it! We did the Sherlock Holmes escape room which was the perfect challenge for our family. Our host Andrew was amazing, knowledgeable, a lot of fun, and very helpful. As a parent with four teenagers in the house, this was the perfect family activity that not only involved every member, but utilized each and every family member strengths and abilities. No one felt left out, and everyone left having a great experience. We will certainly be back!"
