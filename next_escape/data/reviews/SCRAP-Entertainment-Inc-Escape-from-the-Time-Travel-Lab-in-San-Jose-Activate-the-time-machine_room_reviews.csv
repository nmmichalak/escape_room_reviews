We weren't sure what to expect and our group of 6 adults, 3 teen girls and a 10 year old boy had a great time figuring out what to next.  Everyone enjoyed this activity.  This is a very manual room and an ""intern"" stays in the room with you, but there are lots of puzzles so definitely good for large groups.  We were close, probably about 3-5 minutes more and we would have solved it completely.  We've already got plans to do several more this year, but this one is great for large groups and first timers!"

I just played my fourth game with friends and family and for the first time, we completed it!! These games would be excellent team-building events for employees because the only way to win is to use the diverse strengths among the team. The games put on by SCRAP Entertainment are flawless and very professionally done. Go do this, you won't regret it!"

We ended up being in it with a great group of strangers, which was awesome!"

It really is so much fun! The puzzles are very clever, kind of in the style of a Professor Layton game though obviously it's in the real word. I think this adds to the excitement as you're physically moving around and manipulating objects with the other players. One thing I was a little worried about was we were in a time slot with one other group. This ended up being really fun though, as the game is well set up for collaboration. I'd say the difficulty is just about perfect, as we really were ""SO CLOSE!"" Also, the staff are delightful. I can't wait to try another Real Escape Game!"

They're super well organised, and have amazing puzzles. Every time I'm visiting from Australia I make sure to come by - can't wait for the prison break one to start! Yesterday I did the Time Travel Lab with a group of people I didn't know, because all my local friends had already completed that room - it was fine even though I only knew myself, so if you can't find anyone to go with, just book in with some randos!"

Our group missed it by about five minutes; more hints should be shouted by the staff or the fox. Fifteen percent is too low a number. It means they are too hard, especially if those in the room haven't done any game like this before. Would love to see a children's one happen, maybe based on (non brand name) Minecraft or Greek mythology. The history of the game in Japan and Hungary are fascinating. Will recommend to friends."

I want to do it again with the new room. A little pricey, but still worth it."
