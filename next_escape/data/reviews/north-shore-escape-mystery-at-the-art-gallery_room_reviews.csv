The mystery did unveil itself as we solved each puzzle. The game is challenging, yet solvable with team efforts. Sol, the game master, was super friendly. He made the entire experience so much more fun."

I had never done an escape room before, but now I feel like I'm addicted to them and plan to attend the rest in the area. A really fun idea if you're trying to think of a team-building event with your staff!"

I brought 5 friends who have never been to an escape room. We all had a great time. Very impressed with the puzzles and the integration with the story. We will be back to try the next room when it's ready.
