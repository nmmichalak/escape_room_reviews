"Escape room ""Thomas Edison"" by Storm Out in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/breakout-rooms-florida-thomas-edison-the-last-Invention,0,My group of 6 had an amazing time. The Edison room had a few tricks up its sleeve but we were able to escape in the nick of time. Highly recommend taking up the challenge at Code to Escape.

We escaped with 4 minutes to spare. I can't wait to come back and do the other rooms. Staff is super friendly as well! Best part for us was we didn't have to share the room with another group it was just our party!! 5 stars all around."
