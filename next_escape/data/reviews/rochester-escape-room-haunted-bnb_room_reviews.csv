"Escape room ""Haunted B&B"" by Rochester Escape Rooms in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/rochester-escape-room-haunted-bnb,0,"Our group of 6 loved Haunted B&B! The room was decorated very well, and there was a good variety of puzzles to solve. The staff was helpful, but they keep their distance so that you don't get distracted from the theme. Really well done!"

This was my 20th room (yes, I'm addicted) and we came with one absolutely new player as well as family members who have done over a dozen rooms. Everyone had a great time! All of the puzzles made sense, were challenging and fair, and had a spark of creativity we don't always see. The owners were wonderful hosts and obviously put a lot of time and effort into their games. Will definitely be back to play their other room."
