"Escape room ""Rameses Revenge"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston,0,Loved this one.  Felt like I was in an Indiana Jones Movie. The decor and props were well done.  The clues required the entire group to participate.  It was great as other rooms I have played left 2 smart people figuring everything out and the rest of group just standing around.  Highly recommend this one!

The Ramses Revenge challenge is really a lot of fun and it's designed so well. I can't wait to go back! Worth every penny!

This one was sorta easy but kinda not so easy. I'd recommend it though. We highly enjoyed ourselves and I our host Dakota and the rest of the staff was awesome!!"
"Escape room ""Rameses Revenge"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston,4,The experience here exceeded my expectations! We had Rameses Revenge and the room was very authentic and the details were right on. The puzzles weren't too hard or too easy. The group I was with offered up a different piece to solve the puzzle! We made it out with a few minutes to spare!! Definitely going back for the Titanic room!!! Highly recommend for anyone who likes to solves puzzles!
