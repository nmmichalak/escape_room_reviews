"Escape room ""Jailbreak"" by Myrtle Beach Room Escape in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/myrtle-beach-room-escape-jailbreak,0,"This was our first escape room and we loved it. Mike was the guy at the counter and really cool to deal with. It was a bit pricey but hey, it's vacation and everything is expensive. We did the prison break and got stumped more than a few times. Help and hints was always just a call away. We'll be back."

We combined with another group of people and split into two teams. We only had to ask for assistance 3 times out of the hour escape room. The people that listened to our walkie talkie were very helpful.  The workers were very respectful and made bonds with you right away so you trusted them. Being helpful with the clues we needed was very reassuring to our teams. Not to mention, we escaped!! We would recommend this escape room place because it was challenging but not impossible. People with any skill level or experience would have fun at this attraction and it is very funny to solve. Anything you find is useful to the puzzle and it's very amusing to do. The jail escape was definitely the best escape room for us!"

We made it through the Jail and got out with a minute to spare. Would totally recommend if you are up for a challenge. Thanks Mike, will be back!!"
