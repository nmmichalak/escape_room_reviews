"Escape room ""Time To Die"" by Break Out! in Cedar Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/cedar-rapids/quests/break-out-time-to-die,1,We have done two rooms for a team-building event. Taken was a cool room and very tame with the decorations. Just did Time to Die today - it was awesome! Just being told one person had to be handcuffed to the wall and we all had to go in with blindfolds on made it that much more intense! And we broke out! Definitely would recommend.
