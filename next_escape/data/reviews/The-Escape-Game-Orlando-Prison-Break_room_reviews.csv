"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Escape-Game-Orlando-Prison-Break,1,We had so much fun doing this. We escaped the Prison Break and it's really all about communication. There was 5 of us and it was tons of fun. You need to be able to work well with your team mates in order to escape.

Maybe not for little kids. But a great place to go with your family or friends to really build your relationship with them. I would greatly recommend this. I went once and had to go again the very next day. Can't wait to come back and and do another escape.

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Escape-Game-Orlando-Prison-Break,6,"The Escape Game Orlando is the fourth escape-room company I've visited, and after my first experience there yesterday, it's absolutely vying for the top position. We had an amazing time doing the Prison Break room. It's hard to write a review of such a place, because it's absolutely vital that it remain spoiler-free, so that everyone has a chance to have such a great experience. I can tell you that there were several features of the room that were completely unique, not found in any of the other escape rooms I've visited so far. Each of these was a complete surprise, and added immeasurably to the overall experience. We had a team of 5, and it was one of the few rooms I've played that I think we really needed a good sized group. Usually my girlfriend and I do these rooms just the two of us, but this time, I don't think we could have solved it without at least 2 other teammates. The clues and devices were well hidden throughout the game, and the mechanisms for obtaining some of them were simultaneously logical and innovative. There was, quite literally, a surprise around every corner, and every victory led to more and more puzzles to solve, right up to the very end. We had an absolutely fantastic time, and I can't wait to go back and experience the other rooms at The Escape Game Orlando."
