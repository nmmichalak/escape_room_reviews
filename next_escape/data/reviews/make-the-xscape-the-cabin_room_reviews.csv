"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Make The Xscape in Statesville",https://worldofescapes.com/statesville/quests/make-the-xscape-the-cabin,0,"The place is new and the plot is similar to other places I’ve seen.  A few tech puzzles but they didn’t work so owner had to visit room a couple times.  But there was a good amount of puzzles.  Ultimately we solved with time to spare but room- though new- had really battered furnishings, was dirty and no novel puzzles.  It’s a fun play but not a wow.  Owner is super nice"
