"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Orange - Beach in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/breakout-orange-beach-hostage,0,The Breakout Games franchise in Gulf Shores met the same expectations of quality and fun as the St. Louis location. The staff was great and the Hostage Room (which was on our list for our next visit in St. Louis) was a blast!
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Orange - Beach in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/breakout-orange-beach-hostage,1,We played Hostage last night while on vacation and had an awesome time. It was definitely challenging and we almost made it out of the room! Customer service was excellent. I would definitely recommend doing this to a group of people looking for something different and fun to do besides the normal Mini Gulf/Go-Cart scene. Thanks for the great time!
