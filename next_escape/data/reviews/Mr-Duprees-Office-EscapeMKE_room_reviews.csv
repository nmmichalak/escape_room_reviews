"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree's Office"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Mr-Duprees-Office-EscapeMKE,6,"Went with my family of 4 as a Christmas present, and it was a great evening! The scenario was very well-organized and run, and the puzzles was challenging enough that it kept everyone occupied for the whole hour. The room was a little crowded with 10 people, but everyone always felt like they had something to do to help the team escape. Good for people of all ages, though kids younger than high school may have a tougher time."
