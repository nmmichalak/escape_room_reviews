"Escape room ""The Gallery"" by Project Panic Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/project-panic-houston-the-gallery,0,This was one of the most well thought out escape rooms that I've tried! We had a group of 8 in the Art Gallery and everyone had a role in solving the puzzles. This room in particular requires teamwork and communication to complete each puzzle. I highly recommend this place for team building events or if you just enjoy a challenge.

I have played 150+ rooms and while Project Panic doesn't have quite the immersion level of The Escape Game or 13th Gate in Baton Rouge, it more than makes up for any of that with enjoyable puzzles.   Me and my friend escaped with about 5 minutes left.    The game master Ryan was so wonderful and kind.  He was a joy to deal with and we both appreciated his passion for his escape room.    Would absolutely recommend.   We're about to go in and play the cabin fever in just a min!"

We did the Gallery room and just managed to escape (we did cave and make use of the hints though). The escape required plenty of collaboration, plus the room was spacious enough for everyone to spread out and have something to work on. It's clear a lot of creativity and originality went into the puzzles - there were fun surprises and ""aha"" moments at every turn. All in all a fantastic group activity."
