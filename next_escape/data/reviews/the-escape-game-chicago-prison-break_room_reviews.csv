"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-prison-break,0,The wife and I tend to try an escape room or two where ever we go on holiday. This is by far the most fun room we have played. Two teams must work together to escape. So we'll themes and reasonably hard to escape. Really immersive environment. Everything flows very well and pretty logical. Keep your clues till the end....you'll need it.

We participated in the Prison Break and I must say that it was difficult. I loved how you absolutely had to work as a team in order to escape. Our group almost escaped and were only 2 moves away. If for not the clues, we definitely would have still been stuck in the cell lol. Overall just great. Definitely would go again!"

It was so much fun. We almost made it out. It's definitely a challenge but we both loved it. Can't wait to try another room.
