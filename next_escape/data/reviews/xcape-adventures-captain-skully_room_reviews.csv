"Escape room ""Captain Skully"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-captain-skully,0,"We had a private group of 9 for Captain Skully's adventure. We escaped with less than 10 seconds to spare (the failure recording was starting just as we opened the door). This was by far the most imaginative and interesting escape room anyone in our group had been to, and between us, we've been to quite a few places in Dallas and elsewhere. They also told us this was their easiest room! Will definitely be back to try the other adventures, and it also seems like they change up the rooms regularly so you can keep coming back."
"Escape room ""Captain Skully"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-captain-skully,1,Highly recommend this escape room. We've done a few escape rooms and this one is easily among the best I've done. We did the Pirate one and I believe I'm not giving anything away by suggesting that the clues are quite interesting and solvable.It's a family-owned business and the owners/managers obviously love what they do and some of the artifacts in the other rooms (we got a tour) are deliciously quirky and quaint! We are definitely gonna be back to check out the other rooms.

"Escape room ""Captain Skully"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-captain-skully,3,We were trying to decide on going to a haunted house or try this. Glad we chose XCape. So much more fun. The hour does go by fast!!! We did the Scully room and it was pretty cool. We are planning another adventure soon. The staff was unbelievably awesome and down to earth people. You gotta try this and you will love it.
