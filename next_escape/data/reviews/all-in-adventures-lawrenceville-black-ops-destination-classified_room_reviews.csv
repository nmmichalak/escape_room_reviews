"Escape room ""Black Ops - Destination Classified"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-black-ops-destination-classified,0,We did the Black Ops room. Definitely do the practice locks in the front lobby. This will help you know how to open the different type of locks. This room is great for beginners.
"Escape room ""Black Ops - Destination Classified"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-black-ops-destination-classified,1,I came with a group of friends from out of town. We were looking for something new and different. We enjoyed ourselves in the black ops room. We even came back the next day for the sherlock room. The staff was extremely friendly and cane to check up on us as promised. The Mgr was very pleasant always with a smile. We enjoyed our experience and like the location recommended to anyone who wants something different to do.
"Escape room ""Black Ops - Destination Classified"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-black-ops-destination-classified,2,"The manager was very good at explaining how things worked and getting us started. We did the Black Ops room, where we had to find and defuse a bomb. We started off slowly but then moved through the puzzles quickly. We ended up failing due to an unexpected surprise at the end (we didn't understand how the last puzzle worked), but we had a lot of fun nonetheless. We will definitely come back to try a harder room next time."
