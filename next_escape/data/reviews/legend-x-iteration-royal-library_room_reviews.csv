"Escape room ""The Dynasty - Royal Library"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-iteration-royal-library,0," This is my first escape room and it was fun! I came here in a group of 6 and we tried the Royal Library room (first room). Everything there had a purpose and required us to be very resourceful! We could work on multiple puzzles at once so if we couldn't figure one out right away, we could always focus on the other. We barely got frustrated/stuck for a long time and used 2 hints in the first room. There are also some pretty cool tech things/mechanics and some things could be deceiving! Also, I really like how the rooms have some sort of storyline - I think it becomes more interesting.Solving the first room led us to the Alley (second room) and we used our remaining time from the 1 hour time limit to explore/solve things. I think the transition from the library to alley was the most frustrating part because only 2 people could work on the puzzle (very clever but took too long and I had nothing to do) to get us all into the second room. But that second room was actually really pretty. I actually came back with a different group of friends to try the 2nd room, but I thought the first room's puzzles were better (2nd room was also crowded).I would suggest using up all your remaining hints to get as far as you can on your second room because we wouldn't have completed the second room given the amount of time we had left - but perhaps we could've gotten farther. Also, don't play with the pocketwatch they lend you because I accidentally stopped it and couldn't tell how much time I had left OOPS :P Finally, a huge thanks to the guy working there. He's super nice and helpful! He also explained the hints really well (and straight to the point so that we didn't waste time) when we needed help. We even got a photo printed at the end for completing the room, hurrah!"

This is my first time at an escape room. I had never even heard of the concept before this. My husband and I had so much fun playing the Royal Library. We were the only ones who reserved the 5pm timeslot on Friday evening and we got done solving everything before time ran out. You get 1 hour which is a good amount of time. There were a lot of interesting things to find and the puzzles were really tricky and fun to solve. I loved the special effects and the super powers you need to use to unlock hidden objects to reveal the clues. Cool use of technology! I would highly recommend trying it out. I really appreciate getting a printed team photo at the end. What a cool souvenir to remember the experience by! The staff is super friendly, helpful, and nice!"
