"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,0,"Room Omega is not so hard (though we still failed to escape), but the Penitentiary is way harder and has more traps and information that try to mislead you. Really enjoyed my experience in Omescape today!"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,1,"Omgosh!! It was my first time playing a real-life escape game!! I have played a number of online ""escape the room"" games a long time ago, but nothing beats bringing something from the virtual world to REAL LIFE! It was so amazing and so much fun. Once you are inside the room, it was like an escape from reality and became one of those characters inside the computer game. The execution is great and the props are well set-up! I highly recommend coming here with a group of friends because it is such a great bonding experience and it is all about teamwork as well. We came as a party of 7 today to celebrate our friend's birthday. We played the Omega Room, which is suppose to be the easier room from the Penitentiary, with a escape success rate of 33%. It was so tense and exciting and we were mind blown when we solved each puzzle. I'm guilty to say that I was getting scared from the music haha. The staff who worked here tonight was super nice and helped us out a bit when we were stuck :)!! We didn't managed to escape within 60 minutes though... dang it! but the staff still let us finish the game! We then proceeded to take numerous pictures in front of their big wall drop with funny props.It was a great experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for The Penitentiary Room!! which currently has a escape success rate of 11%.A MUST TRY. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NOT, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. :)"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,2,"Really quite fun. If you like scouring the room for clues and then figuring out the riddles to access a new room to scour for clues... this is the game for you! Having now completed Omega (less than a minute to spare) and the Forgotten Treasure (couldn't get the last clue in time), nothing was impossible but having (at least 6) people has worked well for us. When someone just doesn't understand how to solve a problem, at least one person will stumble upon how to solve it. It's frustrating in the good way! Occasionally something mundane like finding a loose object among 4 rooms will stop you, which is genuinely frustrating. For the most part, people can collaborate on the puzzles however there are a couple of choke points (particularly hard last puzzle of FT) that really don't lend themselves to having more than 1 or 2 people work on the puzzle.The staff is nice and give you one Hint to help you get through if you get stuck. If you just think it doesn't make sense, I recommend radioing in not for a Hint but asking if you understand it correctly, because sometimes you are just missing something and you won't finish even if you think it over for 30 minutes. If they say the answer is a Hint, then you can reconsider if you really want to ask.The FT had some clever new puzzles that I liked but I think the Omega room was generally more fun. They had a groupon that was going that cut the cost in half (only for Omega) that I would highly recommend doing.Omega had a 39% success rate and Penitentiary and Forgotten Treasure were both half as much (was it 13% or 19%?). We were amped up after completion (successful or not) and it's really quite exciting and strenuous (again, in a good way)! The themes are a bit silly but overall tie it together well and it's just darned fun!!"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,3,"This was the first escape room experience for my friends and me and we had a blast. It took a bit of convincing to get everyone to go to Richmond and the discounted deal we purchased definitely helped. Once we got to Omescape, we all became focused on solving the puzzles. There were 7 in our group and we tried the easiest room, ""Omega,"" which has a time travel theme.We found the clues to be very clever and exciting. There was a glitch at the start in which we were actually let into the second room before we solved the puzzles to get to that stage. We quickly backtracked and found the proper way to get into that room. It would have been nice if the staff had checked the rooms before we entered.We got stuck on one clue in the second room and we used our one ""lifeline"" there. Once we got past that point, we quickly figured out the remaining clues and rushed out of the room in 55 minutes.It was so much fun that I would have loved to do another room on the spot but we had another appointment to go to and we were terribly hungry and that will have to wait until next time."
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,4,"Let me just get it out there that I'm a recent ""escape game addict"". Our group of 6 tried OMESCAPE - OMEGA ROOM the other day and had a lot of fun. This was the 7th room I've ever done. Six was the perfect # of people for that room. We escaped in 50 minutes and did need 1 hint.Here's my rank from best to worst in terms of escape game rooms:1. ESCAPESF - ANTIQUE ROOM!!! So sophisticated. 2. PANIQ ROOM - PRISON BREAK3. OMESCAPE - OMEGA4. THE BASEMENT (in LA) - THE BASEMENT5. ESCAPESF - ALCATRAZ6. PANIQ ROOM - SICKO7. PANIQ ROOM - GEEKComing back in a couple of weeks to try the Penitentiary and Forgotten Treasure!"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,5,"Super awesome!!!! I've been telling everyone in Los Angeles (where I live) that they have to drive up to Northern California and DO IT!!! I went alone and got out of one room, but not the second one I played though. (I've done 40 escape games, so I am an addict. I would recommend taking people with you!)Room design, puzzles, themes are all great. Staff is nice!"
