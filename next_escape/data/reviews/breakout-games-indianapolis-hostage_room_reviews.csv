A great mix of puzzles and our team of three were able to make our way through them with a little help from our excellent Game Master, Drew. As usual, Hostage lived up to the quality I've come to expect from Breakout Games. Thank you for a great evening."
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-hostage,3,We were bored on a Tuesday afternoon and wanted something fun and challenging to do. Breakout were able to get us a spot! We had so much fun here with Mitchell! He was fun and helpful when we needed it. Even though it was just my fianc√© and myself but we still had a blast! We will definitely be back again.
