"Escape room ""Mystery Manor"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-mystery-manor,1,If you are into riddles and mind puzzles this is the place.The story line is mind challenging and entertaining. This is no video game. My wife and I did well together and completed 80% of the puzzle. We would have beat the clock if we had more people. Best for two or more couples.
"Escape room ""Mystery Manor"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-mystery-manor,2,"I have played all of 60 to Escape's rooms (Containment, Bomb Room, Museum, Blast from the Past, Mystery Manor), and I've loved every single one. They are challenging, but fun, and the game masters always know when to chime in to make sure the team keeps moving and enjoying themselves. What really sets 60 to Escape's rooms apart, in my opinion, are the effects and production value. My family played Mystery Manor this weekend, and OMG, it was SO WELL DONE. The effects were very cool and so immersive that it actually felt like you were in a spooky mansion. I'm so happy to see 60 to Escape expanding, and I hope they have continued success so I can keep playing their rooms. A+"
