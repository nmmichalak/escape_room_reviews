"Escape room ""Bustin’ Out of the Eighties"" by Whole Brain Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/whole-brain-escape-burstin-out-of-the-eighties,2,"My husband, four of our friends, and I had the amazing opportunity to visit Whole Brain Escape and escape from the 80s. We all had a wonderful time! I love puzzles and games and am very competitive so this was a great way to spend the afternoon.  Some of the puzzles are tricky, but as first timers it was still easy enough to figure out.  I can't wait to go back and do the Supervillain room."
