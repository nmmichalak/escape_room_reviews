"Escape room ""The Genie’s Lamp"" by Vault Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/vault-escape-the-genies-lamp,0,Totally new to escape rooms. This was my first one and I had a great time. It wasn't too difficult that we needed a ton of clues but definitely needed a clue or two here and there. Lots of surprises and fun things to interact with. Highly recommended!

Mike greeted us and explained what we had to do. Mike also helped us with clues when we were stuck. Unfortunately we didn't escape. You get 60 minutes, but time flies by. I would come back to try different senerio."

It was a great team-building experience, and very challenging. Highly recommend it!"
