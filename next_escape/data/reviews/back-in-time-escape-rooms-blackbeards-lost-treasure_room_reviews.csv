"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Lost Treasure"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-blackbeards-lost-treasure,0,"I totally thought they were manually controlling the locks in the back while they laughed at our attempts, but the lady insisted that the locks are all player-controlled. Hm... if so, that's amazing because I was like...how did it know we got it right? I was with 3 other people that never did an escape room before so we had unlimited clues. w00t! I'd recommend this place. It's so much fun."

Booking is easy and quick to do online. Just pick a date, location, and which room you want to do. They tell you the size of the room and difficulty level. The staff is so friendly, welcoming, and entertaining!So far I've tried 2 of the rooms and they were both AWESOME! Great themes with a lot of creativity, detailed puzzles and sets/props, and a good level of difficulty to challenge you while keeping it fun! They allow you a certain number of hints during the game, too. (They were even very generous to offer a few extra ones for us - they want you to succeed!) Definitely recommend this place and can't wait to try escaping another room!"
