"Escape room ""Vacancy"" by The Room VB in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/the-room-vb-vacancy,1,We had a great time! We were told Vacancy was the hardest room and they normally don't allow two people to book this room. But we were only two clues away from escaping! Loved the challenges and the room in and of itself! If me and my friend come back to Virginia Beach we definitely will be trying another one of their rooms!
