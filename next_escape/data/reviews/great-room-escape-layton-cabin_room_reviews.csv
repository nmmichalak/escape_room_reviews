"Escape room ""Cabin"" by Great Room Escape in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/great-room-escape-layton-cabin,0,Very good experience. We did the Cabin room and it was scary but in a good tolerable way. The actors that are a part of these rooms do a very good job at giving you hints when needed but making you still think when they do help. Best escape room in Utah.

We went as a group of 6 and although we weren't able to get out, we were so close and had so much fun trying! The puzzles were so well thought out and the whole thing was brilliant! Must do!"
