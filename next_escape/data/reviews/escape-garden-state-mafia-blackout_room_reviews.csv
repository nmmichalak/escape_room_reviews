"Escape room ""Mafia Blackout"" by Escape Garden State in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-garden-state-mafia-blackout,0,"I've done all three rooms at this place, and I have to say they are some of my favorites. The Mafia Blackout room is especially fun, easily the best room I've ever done. Very challenging, and I loved the Sopranos theme as well as the decoration. All 3 rooms were different and challenging in their own way. Booking was easy and reasonably priced (unlike some room escapes in NYC, you really get your money's worth). The employee helping us was always professional and provided hints at a good pace, not too much, not too little. I would highly recommend this room escape for anyone who enjoys a challenge! Looking forward to what they come up with in the future."

I booked the blackout mafia for my boyfriends surprise birthday. And it was an amazing time. It’s fun, it’s exciting, and it’s a great way to challenge your mind while having a great time! Overall al my friends including myself and boyfriend had a fabulous time and can’t wait to do another one!"

We picked the most challenging one ""Mafia Blackout"" and although we did not breakout, we had a blast trying to figure it out!"
