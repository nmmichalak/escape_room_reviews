The puzzle makers thought of everything. We did the Atlantis room which was difficult but a lot of fun. I don't want to reveal too much but just when you think you made it back to the surface safely, think again.Everyone working there was very nice and a lot of fun.Thank you for creating something so immersive and interesting!!"
