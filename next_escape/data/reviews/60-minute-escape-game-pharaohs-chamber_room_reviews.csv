"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Chamber"" by 60 Minute Escape Game in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/60-minute-escape-game-pharaohs-chamber,0,"Anther out of the park room from this company!  The quality and attention to detail rival those in Nashville. The puzzles are a breath of fresh air as they rarely use combo locks in favor of pressure sensors and other unique unlockables.  When going from room to room, you really feel like your exploring a tomb.  We loved this from the first puzzle to the last. Highly recommenced! "
"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Chamber"" by 60 Minute Escape Game in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/60-minute-escape-game-pharaohs-chamber,1,"Visited last night as a team building experience. Our group played in the Egyptian room. The escape was very challenging, well designed, and so much fun! We escaped with very little time left and had a great time. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a way to build camaraderie, sharpen their wits, and have a great time doing it."

I have been to multiple escape games in Nashville, Franklin, and Knoxville. ""Pharaohs Chamber"" is my 2nd favorite out of the 8 I've done so far! What makes the place better than the others is the time our guide took to explain the mechanics of the different aspects of the game after our team had finished. Plus, it's always cool to find a ""local"" place instead of a ""chain"". Thanks for a great time, keep up the good work!"
