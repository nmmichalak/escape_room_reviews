"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-gold-rush,0,The clues were easy enough to find but sometimes difficult to understand. The teenagers were instrumental in our success. Guide was excellent.
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-gold-rush,1,"I have done over 30 escape games in the Cincinnati area. I know I'm obsessed! My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. We did the gold rush room which they allowed us to book for just the two of us! After they let us pick out two free T-shirt's and gave me a $25 Starbucks gift card. They then send if we do another room right then it's 50% off. We had such a realistic first-class experience with the first room so we did the museum heist next! Another INCREDIBLE experience. I have taken groups back to do the other two rooms since that night and again, they were out of this world. By far my favorite escape room yet! These people are first class and treat you as such!!"
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-gold-rush,2,One of the most immersive escape room experiences in town. The puzzles are intricate and challenging. The Gold Rush room has some unique game mechanics that I have not seen in other escape rooms. Will definitely be back.

Our guide was great and helpful.  The assistant manager, Jeremy is a true delight and professional. The rooms are clean and very detailed.  This is great for team building, a friends night out, or family.  I recommend The Escape Game 5 times over!!"
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/the-escape-game-cincinnati-gold-rush,4,"Truly my favorite escape room experience to date (and I've done about 30, with various companies in various locations). The Escape Game Cincinnati is the best company in the tri-state. The rooms are immaculate, immersive, creative, and beautiful. Every room offered is spectacular. When you walk into Gold Rush, you are greeted with the night sky, trees, and a quaint log cabin that couldn't be more realistic without plopping you in a field someplace in rural West Virginia. I am pretty sure they were even piping in pine tree scent to make it even more immersive. HOW COOL. Aesthetics were the best I've ever seen. Also, puzzle design is awesome and varied. A lot of times, there is a kink, even in the best of rooms where everyone in the group gets stuck and either needs a clue or is just anxious to move on to the next thing, and that never happened here. Smooth, intuitive, but still challenging game play. Each puzzle was as good or better than the last. I am a seasoned escape room player and I couldn't help but grin at every new, neat idea the company employed to make this room stand out.  I highly recommend overall (10/10) and this room ties for best room with this company (with The Heist). Gold Rush will go down as one of my favorite escape games, ever!"
