"Escape room ""Rules of Basketball"" by Breakout Lawrence in Lawrence",https://worldofescapes.com/lawrence/quests/breakout-lawrence-rules-of-basketball,0,"I've done 9 escape rooms now, 2 at Breakout Lawrence. Breakout Lawrence has some of the best rooms that I have done, and ""Civil War"" is probably my favorite room yet. ""Basketball"" was very good too. I definitely want to do the other rooms. Great rooms, great staff, great fun."

So cool to see all of that memorabilia and learn about the history of it. When they found out a piece of the puzzle wasnâ€™t working, they helped us past it. We broke out with seconds left on the clock. So much fun!"
