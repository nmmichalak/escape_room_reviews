"Escape room ""Cartman's Escape Room"" by Escape the Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-the-room-la-cartmans-escape-room,1,"My wife and I experienced the South Park and Jurassic-themed rooms, both of which had incredible production value. While we agreed that Cartman's room had the more interesting puzzles, both games were top notch. Staff was friendly, hints were helpful and plentiful, and we will likely return to experiences their two other rooms."
