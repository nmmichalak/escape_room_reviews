"Escape room ""Secret Society"" by Escape Artists in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-artists-orlando-secret-society,0,"We did the Secret Society and it was our favorite room so far. The details were so spot on, and it really made us think. We have done a lot of escape rooms in the past and this just stood out from the rest. We did the previous three rooms offered there and the only one we didn't get out of was the Rest Easy Motel (we were new to escape rooms at the time). All the rooms are very well themed and they are a lot of fun!"

"Escape room ""Secret Society"" by Escape Artists in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-artists-orlando-secret-society,2,"My wife and I have done 100 escape rooms all throughout the east coast. And I would say this venue is top 5. 100 percent immersion and you really feel like you are in a movie. The puzzles and a mixed search and find, simple mind Bender’s, and electronic. We did secret society room and it was great. I have passed the place up for Orlando several times because I didn’t think Sanford you be at the same level as I Drive. I was definitely wrong and the o my regret I have to not finding this place earlier"
