"Escape room ""The Sherlock Room"" by Escape Now Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-now-houston-the-sherlock-room,3,"I honestly did not know what to expect when my mother-in-law gave us this opportunity as a family to participate in the Sherlock Escape room. I had heard of escape rooms, but had no idea what was involved and it is actually fun not knowing what to expect. So, I won't fill you in on details, but I will tell you that the experience was great and it is a wonderful brain challenge. It was great fun working as a team and trying to understand clues and solve them together. And, we got so close to finding the key to escape and we could not have made it as far as we did had we not asked for a few hints along the way. I highly recommend this crazy fun and challenging activity and I do plan to go back and try a different escape room in the near future and another one after that. This is a very well run business and the owners are great as well! "
