"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Bolt NWA in Bentonville",https://worldofescapes.com/bentonville/quests/bolt-nwa-grandmas-attic,0,"My 4 grandkids ages 9-14 and myself enjoyed our visit to Bolt NWA. This was our first time to do an escape room. It was so much fun watching all of us working together to solve the mysteries.We 1st booked Grandma's Attic. We had such a great time, we decided to do Locked also! I loved that each one of us solved clues. I highly recommend Bolt NWA for families. We made wonderful memories and all of us agree, we are going back soon!"
