We did two rooms, the Game of Stones and Blackbeard's Brig.  Great puzzles, no padlocks, electronics to a new level.  Owners were welcoming and helpful and the lobby was so cool.  Highly recommend.  Can't wait to try out their Jungle room.  Will be back!!"

Having done a few before entering the business I was impressed with the decor and attention to detail.  I thought they were a franchise however family owned business.  My family of 8 entering the Game of Stones was very impressed to the medieval theme.  Very intricate puzzles and we all needed to work together.  We did not escape in time but the memories were well worth it.  Will visit again.

Tried many escape rooms and from beginning to end it was an amazing experience.  Owners and staff provided excellent service.  The room was walking into a medieval castle and theme with technology was one we had not yet experienced with other escape rooms.  A must do for all!  Will be going back next month with our ladies night out to experience the Jungle.  Recommended to all!
