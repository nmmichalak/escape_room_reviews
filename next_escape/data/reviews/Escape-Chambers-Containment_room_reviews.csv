"Escape room ""Containment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-Containment,3,We had an enjoyable time. I'd agree with others room size is too small for a large group. We'll certainly return for another round.
"Escape room ""Containment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-Containment,4,Great experience! The staff who walked us through the scenario and interacted with us was amazing. He made the escape room that much better. Would for sure do this again.
"Escape room ""Containment"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-Containment,5,"I had a blast for my girlfriends bday and personally contributed a lot to getting us to the final door. I didn't like how large the group was. Too many strangers in the way not contributing anything to the group, hogging the flash lights, too much time was wasted having to jump over n over again for clues cus one girl woundnt actually jump n wave her arms at the camera. Everyone should get a flashlight. Or the group's should be smaller. I feel if those 3 girls weren't in the way we would have escaped. Overall experience was amazing n I loved it. Great concept. A lil pricy in my opinion. Drop it To $20 instead of $30 n you'll put your competitors out of business. Groupon was a genius idea. It'll prove my theory that you'll get way more business when you lower your cost to play."

We had a blast because it was a great ""out-of-the-box"" activity for my brother's 20th bday. We had a group of 6 in a scenario meant for 8 so it was a great amount of participation. The theme was really fun and creative! They do tell you on their website that it does challenge your mind and that ""gamers"" would be good at it. It's true! Strategy and critical thinking are important! We will definitely be going again to try other rooms! Thank you to the funny and friendly staff for making our experience great! We escaped and hearing that only about 20% do so actually made us more proud, not mad that it was hard..."
