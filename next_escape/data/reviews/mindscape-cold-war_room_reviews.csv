"Escape room ""Cold War: Spring of Life"" by Mindscape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mindscape-cold-war,2,My husband and I have done almost 40 escape rooms. We decided to check out Mindscape and I’m so glad we did. The facilities were nice and I LOVED the room we played. It was called Cold War Spring of Life. It was a well thought out room with a lot of fun puzzles. I definitely want to go back and try the other room!!!
