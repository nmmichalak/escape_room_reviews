"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-the-kidnapping,0,"Kidnapping was my least favorite room offered by Breakout Games Cincinnati. The biggest complaint by my large group was that the room is physically very small and simply cannot contain the maximum number of people it advertises. It is too cramped to move and solve puzzles effectively. So, if you go, I'd recommend 4 people max. The room got incredibly hot and miserable. The idea is good. Ambiance is better than average (at first). But the experience is limited to one small, sparsely decorated room with very little interaction. Fairly straightforward puzzles, but on-theme. The ""handcuffed"" thing is kind of trope-y for the seasoned escape game enthusiast. Anyway, I recommend this room overall (6/10) but rank it as the worst offering from Breakout Games Cincinnati. Play this game last (or not at all, if claustrophobia/heat/lack of design immersion is not your thing) when visiting Breakout Games Cincinnati."

We did Casino for a bachelor party last year and Kidnapping for another one this year. Both were pretty challenging and we got out with just a few minutes left. Weâ€™re already planning on coming back to try out the other rooms, and I hope they add more soon!"

We should have asked for a hint 5 minutes sooner and we may have broken out in time. Clues were tricky and challenging but not impossible. Lots of trial and error. Next time we will need to put one person in charge even. Some red herring clues wasted some time for us but we all had a great time and would love to do it again!
