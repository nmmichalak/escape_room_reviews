"Escape room ""Doctor Frankenstein"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-doctor-frankenstein,0,"We came with two other friends to do Frankenstein escape the room. This is my second experience at Komnata Quest. I was very impressed with the Sherlock room so we were intrigued to try another experience.I must say, the level of details, thought process and interior design were well designed. I found it fascinating how they employed a bit of old school method into this room. I don't want to divulge too many details but it is certainly worth the trek to Greenpoint. The level of difficulty is medium high. We managed to escape this room and had a fantastic time.Our friends loved the experience and booked another room in the city - same company."

We broke up into 4 groups and played Dr Frankenstein, Room 1409, The Bank Robbery, and murder mystery! I personally played murder mystery which was lots of fun! It was creepy and I was even a little scared at some points but it was GREATLY done! We may have even broken a record making it out in 25 minutes!! Just wanted to thank the staff, especially David, the night couldn't have went more smoothly! Can't wait to come back! Dying to try the bank robbery after listening to my family and friends laughing about it!"
