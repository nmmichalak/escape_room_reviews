I've wanted to do this for quite a while but wanted to do it with people I knew. Finally I just decided to take a date and go with whoever showed up. The other group was awesome and I am actually glad I went not knowing everyone. When we got led into the room my first thought was, ""$30 for this? Umm, okay."" But it just keep getting better and better as time went on. Left feeling very glad I went and would recommend it to anyone."
