"Escape room ""Mystery of the Black Dahlia"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-mystery-of-the-black-dahlia,0,"I had a long drive in Florida and was looking for a game to do along the way, I stopped my search at Escape Cocoa Beach. The owners were awesome. I could tell before I started the room it would be a good one (I can usually tell based on the attitude of the person that greets me).      At this point I've done around 40 rooms and I always think I'm going to crush it.... and I am always wrong. The owner Ryan put some real thought into his puzzles and when a puzzle is solved you feel rewarded instead of frustrated. I love when I ask for a hint and it isn't something ridiculous, instead it was a cleverly place clue that I overlooked.    What was really amazing was the actually scenario. All four of his rooms follow an actual historic event. I did the Black Dahlia and I was impressed that the story, puzzles, props and atmosphere all blended together. Nothing was off.  I would definitely love to go back to Cocoa beach to do their other rooms. Once I reached the 20 room mark I stopped trying to rush through them for the best time and started to enjoy the immersion and scenario. This is why Escape Coca Beach is getting 5 - stars from me. The moment you enter the room you can see the passion and hard work that went into creating an amazing event."
