"Escape room ""Escape the Mad Hatter"" by Ryptic Room Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/ryptic-room-escape-escape-the-mad-hatter,0,"This is a ""revolving-door"" style escape room. Your team gets five minutes in a small room with a single puzzle. After five minutes, you're moved to another room regardless of whether you've solved your puzzle or not. There are four rooms total, and you get two chances to solve each room. That means you have a total of ten minutes in each room. If you fail to solve a room after your second try, you'll be unable to escape.The revolving door style lets it boast an impressive player count (24 players?), because different teams can use different rooms in parallel without having to see each other. But it's extremely jarring to be moved from one room to another before you've solved a puzzle, to be moved back into a room that you've half-completed after solving three other unrelated puzzles, or to have solved three out of four puzzles and have nothing to do because the schedule constrains you.And since there's only one puzzle per room, your potentially 6-person team is all crowding around a single task at any given time. Part of the fun of an escape room is the way your group divides to solve different tasks and rejoins to share what they've learned, but that's impossible here since you always have exactly one puzzle in front of you.The puzzles are fairly simple but fun, the decor is amateurish but flavorful. I'm sure there are many worse rooms in the SJ area, but I know there are many rooms that are much much better."

We escaped the Mad Hatter with 30 seconds left to spare! Our game master was fantastic - he gave us helpful hints but never gave it away. The game was stimulating and challenging enough for us that we need help. I highly recommend this place!
