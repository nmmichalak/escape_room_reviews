"Escape room ""Temple of Room"" by Tic Toc Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/tic-toc-escapes-temple-of-room,0,Three of us did the Temple of Room and it was a lot of fun! The puzzles were tricky but not impossible and we were given guidance when we got stuck or overlooked something. We definitely needed teamwork so I'm glad we worked well together. Of course the best part is we escaped! We will definitely be back to do the other rooms. Thanks Tic Toc!

We rented out the temple room, we had one adult, 13y, 12y, 9yr.  We ended up using 5 hints and took a bit over a hr.  They let us finish it.  Puzzles were fun, all kids were engaged and felt like they all contributed.Thanks for the great time!"

Totally different than just doing a dinner and a movie. We had the chance to truly work together in the ""Temple Of Room"" and we were the only two people in there which made it better."
