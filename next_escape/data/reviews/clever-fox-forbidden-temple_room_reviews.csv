"Escape room ""Forbidden Temple"" by Clever Fox in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/clever-fox-forbidden-temple,0,This place is great for everyone! We did the temple room and it was awsome. The puzzels are very high quality. The room was very immersive with great design and set. The rooms have something for everyone along with puzzels that appeal to adults and kids. And the staff is kind and welcoming. I highly recomend this place.

We've done over 40 escape rooms, and we were pleasantly surprised with the variety and complexity of the clues in the Forbidden Temple.  The set was great, and the immersion was top notch!  We'll be back for Outbreak in a few weeks. Can't wait!"
