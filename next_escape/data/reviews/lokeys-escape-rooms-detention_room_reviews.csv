"Escape room ""Detention"" by Lokey's Escape Rooms in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/lokeys-escape-rooms-detention,0,I experienced my first escape room at Lokey’s with my daughter. We had a great time escaping detention. Can’t wait to go back in July with the whole family. Richard is a very talented story writer and gave great clues.

We played the Detention Room over the weekend and absolutely loved it. The owner, Richard, really brings the room’s story to life in a way that we’ve never experienced before. The level of detail is fantastic. This was a pretty challenging room for 2 people. We didn’t make it out in time, but still had a ton of fun. Can’t wait to go back and try the new “Press Start” room!"

From the very beginning it was great fun and very challenging. One of the girls in our group took the lead which really helped with our progress but even she was stumped at times. We will definitely try the other rooms in the future. The owners provided great support and kept in character with the theme of the room. I would highly recommend!!"
