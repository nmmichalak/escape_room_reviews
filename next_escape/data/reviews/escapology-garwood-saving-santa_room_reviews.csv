What a pristine and gorgeous facility! I went with my husband and my 8,6, and 5 year olds! We had so much fun bonding and working as a team to solve puzzles! It was seriously the best escape room experience I have ever had and I was with my kids! Canâ€™t wait to try out the other rooms with my adult friends! 100% recommend!"

Beautiful place with such an inviting atmosphere immediately when you walk in.  Staff was so nice and friendly.  Michael and John (who is a long time Fanwoodian) welcomed us immediately.  We had a blast with the kids and we ""Saved Santa"" with 12 minutes to spare!  So much fun! Highly recommend checking it out.  Thanks for a great night out with the kids!"
