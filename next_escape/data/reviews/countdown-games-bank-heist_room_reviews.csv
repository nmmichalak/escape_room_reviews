"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-bank-heist,0,"Bank Heist was AMAZING. It was so challenging and had so many awesome clues and puzzles throughout the room. I'm a little sad I can't go back and do it again because it was that amazing!! We had less than 7 minutes to go and I didn't think we were anywhere near getting out, and then we did with less than 2 minutes to spare!"
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-bank-heist,1,"Bigger, better, and cheaper than the competition! Played here twice in the same week, both times the environment was highly detailed and spacious. I loved that there were different amounts of money to steal in the bank heist. Lots of moving parts and doors to keep things interesting and the decorations are so realistic. Lots of variety in game play, not just keys and locks like other places."
