The room was completely immersive and interactive. The puzzles were unique, challenging, fun and completely different from any other escape room I’ve been in. The building is beautiful and the staff was excellent. The game master was in character the entire time which definitely added to the experience.If you’re looking for an escape room to try, definitely choose this one!"
