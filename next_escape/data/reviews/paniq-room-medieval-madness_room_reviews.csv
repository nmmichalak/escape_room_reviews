"Escape room ""Medieval Madness"" by PanIQ Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/paniq-room-medieval-madness,0,"My friends and I visited 2 escape rooms here- Wizard & Medieval. We had a great time as Wizards and enjoyed all the activities in this room. The room has a little wear and tear so some items give themselves away pretty easily but we had a great time! The Medieval room was another story. They do say it is scary and I found that to be very true. But it was more macabre (dead severed heads, creepy sound effects, and torture devices). If that's your thing- enjoy. That room was hard though- so hustle!"
