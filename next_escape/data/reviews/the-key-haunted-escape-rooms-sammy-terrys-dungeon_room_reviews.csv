"Escape room ""The Seance"" by The Key Haunted Escape Rooms in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-key-haunted-escape-rooms-sammy-terrys-dungeon,0,You should get your group out to the Key Haunted Escape Rooms and enjoy a great night with all your fiends ugh I mean friends. Highly recommended. The owner and the staff are super nice. I had a fiendish time tonight. Also it is home to Sammy Terry's Dungeon. and his escape room. I was also part of the Jan 19th live event. Hats off to Sammy Terry and his crew and to all the great people at the Indy Key Haunted Escape Rooms. I want to go back and do a Seance Room.
