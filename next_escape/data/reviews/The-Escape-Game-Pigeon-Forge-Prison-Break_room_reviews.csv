The associates were all incredibly friendly, helpful and engaging, and we were paired with wonderful people, which made it that much better. Prison Break was so much fun, and we can't wait to try the other games. If you're in Pigeon Forge and looking for a fun family activity or a great team builder, there's no place I could recommend to you more than The Escape Game - we'll definitely be back!"
