"Escape room ""Z51"" by Can You Escape? LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/can-you-escape-li-z51,2,I did the new Z51A room and really loved the gameplay! There were a couple of small hitches...nothing serious at all. But it was a blast! The puzzles were very clever and we really got into solving them!!! Definitely worth it!!! Erika was our game master and really made the experience so much more exciting!!!!
