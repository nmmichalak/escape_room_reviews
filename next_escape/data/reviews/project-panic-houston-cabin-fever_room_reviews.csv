"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by Project Panic Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/project-panic-houston-cabin-fever,0,"One of the best designed panic rooms I've ever been to. Did the Cabin Fever room with 9 other people and got out with 5 minutes to spare - definitely not easy, but just challenging enough! The puzzles involved were unlike any other panic room I've been to. They were unique and very much so outside the box. If you're in the area and want to have some fun, this place is a must-go!"

Had an incredible time in the cabin fever room. Overall, I was especially impressed with the creativeness that went into the tech pieces of this scenario. It definitely made for a topic of conversation after we escaped!Having participated in a few escape rooms in the past, I would say cabin fever would be most appropriate for smaller groups or those looking for an intermediate level of difficulty.This was such a fun memorable experience with friends, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to liven up their Houston weekend!"

The 9 of us were able to escape from the Cabin Fever room with time to spare. While the puzzles were challenging, everyone from my 12-year-old brother to our parents was able to participate and have fun. I appreciated how interactive (and clean!) the room was, with lots of different kinds of clues, puzzles, and locks to solve.This was a great experience that I would recommend to anyone looking for something to do in Houston! Bring your family and friends and family friends."
