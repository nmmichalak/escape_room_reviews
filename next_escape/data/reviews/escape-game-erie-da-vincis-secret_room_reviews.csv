"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by Escape Game Erie in Erie",https://worldofescapes.com/erie/quests/escape-game-erie-da-vincis-secret,0,"This was a blast! We did the Da Vinci themed escape room as a date night, and it was so much more fun than a run of the mill night out!

"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by Escape Game Erie in Erie",https://worldofescapes.com/erie/quests/escape-game-erie-da-vincis-secret,1,We were looking for something to do and decided to give this a try. We saved DaVinci's paintings with 15 seconds left and had a really great time! It was quite a challenge. And thanks to our host Tera for the guidance when bumbling around with the clues. We can't wait to try out the other rooms!
