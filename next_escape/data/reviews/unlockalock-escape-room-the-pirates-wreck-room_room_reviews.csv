It was very challenging but not impossible. We did not escape but still had a blast. We did the Pirate room and are planning on going back to do the throne room. Great night out for your group.

We did the Pirate Room and really enjoyed it. The people running the room owned the place and cleared really cared about us having a great time. The room was very challenging and clever! We saw things we hadn't seen anywhere else. Highly recommend.
