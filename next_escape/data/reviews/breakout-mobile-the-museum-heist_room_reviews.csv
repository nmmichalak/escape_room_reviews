We did the Museum Heist, a very fun and brain-teasing room. The Breakout crew was super and the facilities were set-up very well. We made it out at 48:56 and will be back to do another room."

The 9 year old may have been a bit young and therefore, frustrated because he couldn't figure out clues, but the others (11, 12, 13) had a blast and really got into it. We had a great time working together on how to break out of the museum heist. "
