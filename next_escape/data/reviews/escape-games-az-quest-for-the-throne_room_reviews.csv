"Escape room ""Quest for the Throne"" by Escape Games AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-games-az-quest-for-the-throne,0,It was very fun! We really enjoyed the experience. The only thing I would change is the rooms need something else like background music or something to add more pressure to it besides the timer. But we will be back to try the other rooms! We did the quest for the throne.

It was well thought out and had very and had very unique puzzles to work through. Great job

The hints were helpful and timely. For the Groupon price, this room experience was a steal! Thanks for a fun family night out! We will definitely be back!"
