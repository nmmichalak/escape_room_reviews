"Escape room ""Brain Freeze"" by Holmes Escape Games in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/holmes-escape-games-brain-freeze,0,Me and my friends had a really fun time playing the escape game here. It was our first time and the owners explained every thing very well and were very friendly. We did the Brain freeze game and it was indeed challenging. But we did manage to nail it just in the brink of time with the help of few hints. Overall had a great time and highly recommended!

The owner was really cool and easy going. The establishment was very clean and well maintained. I will definitely go back to do another room. "
