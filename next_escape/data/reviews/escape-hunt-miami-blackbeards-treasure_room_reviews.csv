"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Treasure"" by Escape Hunt in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-hunt-miami-blackbeards-treasure,0,"Based on the legend of Blackbeard the pirate, you are scurrying around an old, abandoned ship searching for…treasure!We loved the atmosphere in this room–we felt like we were trapped on the infamous Queen Anne. Production design was good and the room had some extremely clever ways for activating circuits and opening doors and boxes that had both of us oohing and aahing. Currently clues are asked for through a walkie-talkie, though they are working to upgrade the clue system in that room (which is good because they walkie-talkie did seem to keep picking up someone else’s transmission!).But. We didn’t always feel like we knew what we were supposed to be doing. The flow of the puzzles was a bit scattered and the storyline unclear. It’s wasn’t always clear to us what we were solving or why were solving it that way. Or even how we actually got out of the room. The game seemed to just stop. When talking to Noel and Stephan afterward, they explained the actual escape scenario. We looked at each other and realized…we hadn’t actually done that!They are also very open to feedback–possibly more so than any other company we’ve been to. They sat us down with more tea and biscuits (of course) and had a conversation with us about what we liked, what could be improved, and our general sense of the room. So we feel very confident that this place will continue to improve based on their openness."

Fun and challenging at the same time. Certainly the best indoor activity in Miami. We will certainly be back to try another room!

It was very challenging but fun. The attention to detail and how some of the clues were triggered were completely new to me, which was refreshing and exciting!The owner is amazing and was very hospitable. The place itself is GORGEOUS. The decoration in the lobby was so impressive we thought we have already stepped inside an escape room! We will definitely be returning to complete the other two themes."
