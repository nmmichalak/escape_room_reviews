"Escape room ""CIA Task Force"" by Lockbox Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/lockbox-escape-room-cia-task-force,0,"My husband, niece, daughter and I escaped the CIA Task Force - The Gamer room! Puzzles were very creative and well done. We got the harder ones without hints, but had to get a couple of hints on the easier ones - overthinking it a bit! Henry and Darren were helpful and friendly! We will play another room soon."

So awesome to work together as a family and the boys both solved puzzles on their own. Shaina helped us when needed and we made it out with a little time to spare. Will be back for Timeline!"

I have done 6 escape rooms around town and this room had some of the coolest tech ""gadgets"" involved in the clues. The room was well thought out. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the room. Highly recommend Lockbox Escape Room to all of my friends."

CIA Taskforce was well above and beyond the expectations of even my skeptical team mates. The puzzle was clever and I was impressed by the technology used. We laughed, we cheered, we high-fived and hugged. Of course, we made it out with 10 minutes to spare but, even so, wonderful experience. Shoutout to Charlie who was very patient as we shifted things around because of a potential hurricane. He also coordinated catering for us. Awesome!"
