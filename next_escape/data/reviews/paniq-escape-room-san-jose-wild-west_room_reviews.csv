"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room San Jose in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paniq-escape-room-san-jose-wild-west,0,"I had the complete opposite experience from Amy. The staff did not seem to care at all that we were struggling.  The Wild West rooms were too dark for 3/4 of our group to see the clues/puzzles. Did not get the sense that they were watching our progress and were willing to help us.   The staff members were like robots in and out of the room.  Didn't adjust their words at all to have a conversation with us/make us feel welcome/seem like they cared about our experience.  One of the clues was not reset properly, wasting our time (we solved a puzzle to open something, and there was nothing there. The ""hidden"" object was sitting out in the open the whole time. The rooms were dirty and we were looking for clues in amongst dust/hair. I had a much better experience at a smaller business that really seemed to care about our enjoyment of the room and was watching us closely and ready to suggest that we use a clue so we'd finish in time. It would have been lovely if this game master had turned up the lights or allowed us to use our phones' flashlights so that we could see better and have a chance of completing the room.  We also did not know how many rooms the puzzle involved, so we thought we were on track to finish and then discovered there was a whole other larger room with the majority of the work in it.  This room is advertised as good for beginnners, but you need a large group with young eyes to complete this room if you are beginners. Our group was obviously not ready for this room, but I really think that there were issues with our experience separate from our insufficient puzzle-solving abilities. "

The rooms had high production value, and they were well decorated to fit the themes. Rooms were very spacious and had cool automated puzzles. If you do a same day sign up for another room you get 30% off that second room."

We did the western themed room. The host was cool and nice. The room is no joke! They had real props that worked and it took us out of reality for a while. It was nice to see our team worked together to get through the room. You guys should check it out!

There were seven of us. The room had many reasonable puzzles. Some were definitely more challenging than other ones, but that's part of the fun!Jonathan, our guide, was quite friendly and helpful during our time inside the room. His hints were great in that we still had the opportunity to figure the puzzle out on our own (i.e. he did not outright give us the answers)."

This theme amazed me, It really feels like you're in a western movie. It's not too hard but still challenging, recommended for everyone. The staff is awesome, they really know if you need help or not. Don't miss it if you are in San Jose!"

The Paniq team did an amazing job, you actually feel like you're back in the 1800s. Also the puzzles are extremely well thought out! Having done more than 30 rooms myself, I've barely seen any of those puzzles anywhere else.10/10"
