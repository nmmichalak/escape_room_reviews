There were enough of us to split into two groups and compete in escaping high school detention. We had a blast. Will definitely visit in the future.

The detention room was super challenging, but still very fun. Matt enhanced our overall experience with his humor and upbeat attitude. I would definitely recommend this place to others. I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""High School Detention"" by House of Hints in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/house-of-hints-high-school-detention,2,Pretty good room with some fun twists. I would recommend it to anyone and would give it a 7/10 based on the rooms I’ve completed. My main downside was that I thought the main story didn’t necessarily flow throughout the entire game but still fun and unique puzzles.
