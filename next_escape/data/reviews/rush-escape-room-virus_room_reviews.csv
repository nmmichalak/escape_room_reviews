"Escape room ""Biohazard"" by Amazing Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/rush-escape-room-virus,0,Talk about an adrenaline rush! We did the Virus Room and got out with 7 secs to spare. Make sure you take your logically inclined friends lol. I went with a group of 4 and there was another group of 4 and a kid with us but the host reminded us that we were a team. I'm ready to go back and do another one!
"Escape room ""Biohazard"" by Amazing Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/rush-escape-room-virus,1, took my son and two of his friends to escape the VIRUS room. They had a blast and I truly enjoyed just watching the dynamics of the group as they worked together frantically but made it out with 32 seconds left on the clock. What a great time and friendly staff. We will be going back for the new CABIN experience.

This was my first escape room experience and it was awesome! We did the virus room. I got the voucher for 8 and it was so much better, in my opinion, with more people. The staff was friendly and fun! I would definitely go back again! Definitely worth the money and it is something different to do."
