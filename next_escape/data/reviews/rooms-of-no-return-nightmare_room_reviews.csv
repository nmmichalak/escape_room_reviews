"Escape room ""The Long Lost Pharaoh"" by Rooms of No Return in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/rooms-of-no-return-nightmare,1,"The decor of the room was fantastic. The actors were also great. The theme we did, Nightmare, was wonderful. We felt like the clues weren't very sequential and we spent a majority of the time just searching for items. The front desk ladies were also nice."

The staff were super nice people. My impression was that is would be one room, but we actually had 3 rooms to traverse. You have to solve one part to get to the next part, and so on. It was worth it! We had the room to ourselves with our family. The kids really enjoyed the challenge as well. Just make sure you ask if it's kid friendly if you plan on bringing your kids."
