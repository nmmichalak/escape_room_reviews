"Escape room ""Rush Hour"" by Escape Zone in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-zone-rush-hour,0,I am a big fan of escape rooms. Did the Rush Hour room with just my boyfriend and I and it was a good mix of simple and complex. I felt that this helped the game progress at a good pace without being discouraging or obvious. The staff was AMAZING and SUPER polite.I am picky about my escape rooms and I can say that this one passed my expectation. Worth every dollar!
"Escape room ""Rush Hour"" by Escape Zone in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-zone-rush-hour,1,"We did the Rush hour room. I did like how it's not linear, meaning you can be working on different things at different times. There were 3 of us in the room and I think that was enough. It is a small room, but it's meant to be on a train. They had screens that showed the city of Tempe passing by like you were on the light rail. Very nice touch. We all enjoyed the escape room and made it out with 10 minutes to spare and didn't even use all our clues!! WOOHOO!!Can't wait to try the other rooms there.Well decorated room and the staff was friendly and fun."

We did the Rush hour room and it was a lot of fun! We didn't make it out in time but we got pretty close! Great location in downtown Tempe near ASU!

The lady running the game was really nice. She spent time explaining things we had questions about and she answered our questions about upcoming rooms. The room was really fun and it had a lot of unique puzzles. Though we enjoyed the room and I recommend trying it, I would not recommend the room to beginners. We have done around 25 rooms, and this one was pretty tricky. We will definitely be back for their other rooms!"
