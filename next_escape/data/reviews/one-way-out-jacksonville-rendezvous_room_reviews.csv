"Escape room ""Rendezvous"" by One Way Out Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/one-way-out-jacksonville-rendezvous,0,"We have done all but two of the rooms at One Way Out. We have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Our favorite was the Rendezvous room. The staff there are wonderful and and each room is exciting and thought provoking. This is a great family, friend, and team-building activity."
"Escape room ""Rendezvous"" by One Way Out Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/one-way-out-jacksonville-rendezvous,1,"This is only the second escape room I've done and I'll definitely be back for more. My family and I did the ""Rendezvous"" room and it was an absolute blast for all of us. Well thought out, well designed, and highly immersive. The staff did an excellent job at getting us situated (each room is a chapter in a whole story, so if starting out of order they make sure you're up to speed) and made it challenging, but it's supposed to be! I'm already looking to come back with friends, coworkers and anyone else who's up for a good time. You won't be disappointed with your visit!"

We ended up at One Way Out because they were the only place open at such a late hour. The Rendezvous room wasn’t our first choice, but it was the only available room (again, we got there about 10:45 pm). I cannot even begin to tell you how much fun we had!!! We didn’t even complete the room, but we still had an unbelievable time! It was like being on the set of an action movie! It’s a little more difficult than other escape rooms I’ve heard about, but the experience is totally worth it! I can’t wait to go back!"
