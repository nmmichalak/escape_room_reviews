My family and I did the Live or Die challenge and we lived! We had two adults and two young teens. We would recommend this location!
"Escape room ""Live or Die 2: Killer's Revenge"" by Louisville Escape in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/louisville-escape-live-or-die,2,"I was in a group of 6 people and we did the “Live or Die 2” room. We had so much fun and were able to escape with just 50 seconds to spare! We were also handcuffed and never found the key for cuffs! The puzzles were fun to figure out and I was very impressed with the set up the room. The staff was very nice, accommodating and professional. This is definitely an escape room to check out if you’re in Louisville."

We all had a great time. I was a little worried that the 8-year-olds might get scared. But they obviously had a blast, especially when we broke out! The staff Rob is very nice and helpful."
"Escape room ""Live or Die 2: Killer's Revenge"" by Louisville Escape in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/louisville-escape-live-or-die,4,"We had heard about this place from a few friends so we had to try it. We had a group of 7. First time we have done something like this. Our room was Live or Die 2. From start to finish was awesome and kept us on our toes. We all worked together to get to the end. You definitely have to use critical thinking. We recommend this and will be back for the Bank Caper! Hats off to our GameMaster Kelly, she really helped when we needed."
