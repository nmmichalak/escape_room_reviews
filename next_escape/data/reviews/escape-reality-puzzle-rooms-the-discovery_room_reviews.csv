"Escape room ""The Discovery"" by Escape Reality Puzzle Rooms in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/escape-reality-puzzle-rooms-the-discovery,0,"Had a great time in the discovery room this afternoon. Somehow we ended up skipping some steps and they were very helpful getting us back on track without giving too much away. It was challenging, fun and a fantastic experience. We escaped, and can not wait to come back and try the other room!"

It rained on my birthday, so we opted for indoor adventures. My friends and I did The Discovery and got stuck on the very last clue! The staff/clues were really helpful, though one did lead us to what we think was a dead end. The tricks in the room were really cool! Can't wait until they get their new room up and running!"
