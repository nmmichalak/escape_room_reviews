We did both VR experiences, and the second experience was ALL thanks to her for really making us feel like family.The entire staff was very accommodating, helpful, and maintained a positive and professional attitude despite the large amount of groups that flooded their doors. Huge kudos to the team last night.Thanks to them we ended up buying more rounds than expected and joined their loyalty program. We'll be coming back for sure!"

We had a party of 4. We did the VR The Lost Pyramid, VR Beyond Medusa's Gate and The Time Machine rooms. All were really fun!The staff was friendly and very helpful. Our Game Masters Michelle and Chris were superb! They were very nice. During the Time Machine, Michelle gave hints as we needed and suggested certain things. We were told The Time Machine episode was the hardest. They were able to move our time to a little earlier since the room was available. We will definitely be back for more episodes.The facility was clean and the props were well done. Everything worked as it should.Don't forget to sign up for the Loyalty Club as there are discounts for each visit."
