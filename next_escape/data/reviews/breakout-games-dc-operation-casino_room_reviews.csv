"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-operation-casino,4,"Booked online and ahead of time for Casino Heist for 7 teen boys. The process was easy. The clues in the room were difficult since we did not know much of Casino, but it was fun. Staff was helpful and provided clues when asked.
