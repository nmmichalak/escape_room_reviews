"Escape room ""The Orphanage"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-the-orphanage,0,This was our first escape room experience we planned as a girls night fun for something new and exciting. And I must admit we were impressed!!! The puzzles kept us challenged without losing the idea of just having fun. The gamemaster was awesome and the elements of their room was very impressive and on point. All I can say is... we... will... be... back!

One of the best escape rooms I've ever done (roughly 50 escape rooms give or take). The atmosphere was perfectly creepy and kind of kept you on your toes, very different and fun puzzles, great game master (we only knew him as our Dark Lord) and just a great time overall. I can't recommend this game enough!"

To start off the staff is very nice and informative if it is your first time, but we didn't need any explaining, so they asked us about our previous experiences doing escape rooms. The puzzles were well thought out and some were elaborate especially from the very beginning, you have to use your head and pay attention to all clues around you. We did use 3 clues to only find out we were already on the right track we just needed reassurance. We escaped with 15 minutes to spare ! They do have one other room at this location called Nautical (remember I'm talking about the one on western). The location might be a little hard to find at first but the sign is on their door. Street parking only, they have meters, or you can park down the side street during certain times around the corner. Highly recommend for a small birthday party, company outing for 6 employees, or even something to do when bored or looking for more things to do in LA aside from the common tourist things ."
