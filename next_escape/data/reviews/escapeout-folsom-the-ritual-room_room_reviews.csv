"Escape room ""The Ritual Room"" by EscapeOut Folsom in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escapeout-folsom-the-ritual-room,0,"My daughter and friends did ""The Ritual Room"" for her 12th birthday. They had so much fun! Pete was a great host, super accommodating and helpful when they needed help. Especially liked that he walked them through the final steps when they didn't ""escape"". They couldn't stop talking about it all the way home and are already planning when they can go back. Thanks for a great time!"
