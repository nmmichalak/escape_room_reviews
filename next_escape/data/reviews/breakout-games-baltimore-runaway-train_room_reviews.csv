"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-runaway-train,0,"We did Runaway Train at Breakout Games in Timonium, MD and had a great time. It was a little heavy on the math and being the only person not terrified of math, that was a lot of work on me. Thankfully we still got through it - with only about a minute and a half to spare, but it would have been nice for a little more variety in puzzles to make it easier on the group."

Runaway Train in Timonium was the challenge. Finished in 57:38. My sons did all the work. Mike was our game master and he was awesome. Will definitely be back.

We participated in “The Runaway Train” and “The Kidnapping”! Both rooms featured realistic sets, immersive puzzles and a lot of fun! Would highly recommend any escape room fanatic to come give Breakout Games a try! I’m sure you’ll be very pleased with your experience!"
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-runaway-train,4,"Well constructed escape room. Countdown clock is in the room. Contrary to the difficulty rating on this site, this is the most difficult room at the site. The puzzles are quite difficult and arriving at the answer isn't always straight forward. Mostly linear puzzle progression, and the room(s) is small. So a large group will have bored players standing around waiting to do something. "
