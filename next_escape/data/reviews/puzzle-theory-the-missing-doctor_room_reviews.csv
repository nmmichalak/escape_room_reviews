Our puzzle room, The Missing Doctor, had multiple rooms and was challenging. We had fun and finished with a few minutes to spare. Would recommend to friends."

We did the Missing Doctor room and it was really tough. The clues weren't nearly as easy as I thought they would be, you really had to think hard about each one and the fact that multiple clues were broken up into pieces made it that much more difficult. Great time by all. Definitely recommend!"

So we came back for Missing Doctor - and it was amazing!!!! Nick is so friendly, the puzzles are intense and extensive, and the story has great humor running throughout. Truly a great time!"

Can't wait to try The Interview and The Experiment in future!

We will definitely be coming back as they add new ones.Four of us did the Missing Doctor room. The room itself was not as interesting of a setting as other puzzle rooms we've done, but the puzzles were better and more challenging. They required thought and there was enough things going on that you could all be doing something different and not crawling on top of each other. Because of this I enjoyed this place more then the others we have gone to."
