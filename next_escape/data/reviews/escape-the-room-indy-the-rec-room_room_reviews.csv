"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-the-room-indy-the-rec-room,0,"I took seven 14-year-olds here for my daughter's birthday, and they all said it was ""super fun."" They tried to escape the ""Rec Room"" - an 80s-themed room - but failed. While they had a great time, I particularly wanted to share that Richard on their staff was outstanding. He helped me navigate some scheduling difficulties and it was incredibly appreciated."
"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-the-room-indy-the-rec-room,1,We did the 1980s rec room and it was a blast! We liked that it was linear in that one clue led to another. Definitely made you think and had fun puzzles to solve! Jacob was wonderful and gave us some guiding tips without making anything too obvious. Fun experience and nice facility!
"Escape room ""The Rec Room"" by Escape the Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-the-room-indy-the-rec-room,2,It was myself (lived the 80's) and my group of 4 teens on spring break in the Rec Room. The teens didn't know the 80's to help answer some clues but the room monitor person was really nice and helped us along the way when we got stuck. Kids loved it and want to go back when we have a special occasion or something in the future. Staff was very friendly and nice.
