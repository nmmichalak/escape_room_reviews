"Escape room ""The A.I."" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Exit-Game-The-A-I,0,"Love the escape rooms at this location and AI does not disappoint.  Highest technology I have seen, the room was incredibly fun and exciting to play with nice decor and hidden secrets that unwrapped the story as we played.  We got lucky and got the harder ending (staff told us there were two endings possible).  Go try it if you havent already!"
