"Escape room ""The Illuminati Box"" by UFO VIDEO in Gainesville",https://worldofescapes.com/gainesville/quests/mystery-bros-escape-rooms-the-illuminati-box,1,This place is awesome! I highly recommend it. We did the Illuminati Box scenario and it was a ton of fun. This was my 5th escape/puzzle room and it was by far the most unique. There was a computer glitch with our reservation and Will completely understood and created a time slot just for us so we could play before leaving town. I wish we were around for the Video Store scenario. It sounds awesome!
