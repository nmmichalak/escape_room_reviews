"Escape room ""Evans & Sontag Jail Cell Escape"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-jail-cell-escape,1,This was my family's first time doing an escape room.  The host couldn't have been much nicer.  He was friendly and inviting.  The ambiance was warm.  They have lockers so you can store your personal belongings while you are in the escape room.  Puzzle are fun.  Even the easier riddles/puzzles can be challenging when out under pressure.  You are given an hour to escape the room.  Definitely coming back to try the other themed rooms.
