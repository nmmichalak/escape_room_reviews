"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,0,"This is a challenging but enjoyable room. I took my son and a bunch of his friends for his 13th birthday, which happened to be on Friday the 13th. It was just the right amount of spooky and strange to go with the theme of the day. The clues are very challenging but extremely creative and with just a tad bit more time, we probably would have solved it. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a challenging, fun, group experience."
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,1,This was the first escape room I've ever attempted but it was so fun! It is a little difficult to find but there is lots of parking. The asylum theme brought the whole room to life. (I got scared not going to lie). And the puzzles were challenging and very well thought out. I had a great experience.

We had so much fun and enjoyed the group challenge. Lots of laughs, a few scares, and a lot of brain-busting clues to solve! Can't wait to come back again. Highly recommended for fun and for groups!"
