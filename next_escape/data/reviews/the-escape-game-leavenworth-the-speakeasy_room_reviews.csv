"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by The Escape Game Leavenworth in Leavenworth",https://worldofescapes.com/leavenworth/quests/the-escape-game-leavenworth-the-speakeasy,0,"The speakeasy room was a blast. We took both our sons and their family for a treat to the escape room and it was well worth the time. Great story line and kid friendly. I had my youngest grandson there at the age of 6 and a niece age 10, they were able to assist with several of the clues and very involved. Staff was very helpful with explaining the story line and the tour to the underground was great. Highly recommend the tour to see the old store fronts underground and the speakeasy area that still exists. Fantastic place for family fun and bonding for an afternoon think tank.  Thanks for having us we have already made plans in the future to return to the other rooms and look forward to the expansion you have in the future. Thanks the “ M Team”"

It is small, and the clues are very difficult to read if not falling apart.  We have our escape room assistant come in the room twice to fix clues.....  Everyone is friendly but honestly don’t waste your time.  You get a quick tour of some historic tunnels, but I didn’t come to an escape game for a history tour...."
"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by The Escape Game Leavenworth in Leavenworth",https://worldofescapes.com/leavenworth/quests/the-escape-game-leavenworth-the-speakeasy,2,"No. Just no.We've been to many an escape room across the country, but this one in Leavenworth is by far - the worst.I'm hesitant to submit a review as I like to support small and local businesses. However. At over $20 a pop (for one hour) - this escape room is not worth your time.The room is entirely too small. We were only three people and were cramped. I can't imagine having the max of 8 people jammed into this tiny space (equivalent to a large walk-in closet). Some of the clues were old (falling apart, torn, hard to read, even though this was not part of the story-line).Many clues were broken and unreadable.And a few did not work at all (which warranted the employee to enter our locked room (while the clock was ticking away) to unjam or fix the broken clue.Employees should not have to return to your room numerous times to ""fix"" their clues. This is not part of the escape room process. One clue involves numbers written with sharpies on cheap plastic gold coins. Except - half of the numbers were smudged off and the employee had to enter our room just to help clarify what should already be easily readable to an escape guest. One should not have to ask for clue clarification due to malfunctioning and decrepit clues. (Seriously???)We were all hugely underwhelmed. The establishment itself was untidy and unorganized. We were originally led downstairs to dark tunnels and asked to retrieve flashlights - but no information explaining why we were walking downstairs. We thought this is where the escape rooms must be located. Nope. You go on a history tour of the tunnels beneath the space (which is cool to see!) but it was littered with garbage, debris, and cluttered along the way with filth. I mean - whaaaaat???? It was only when we came back upstairs....confused....and we asked - Are we going BACK downstairs? Why did we just see the neat historic tunnels? That we were told - ""No...that was just a tour of the tunnel"". Then. The employee (who was actually very kind) apparently didn't correctly capture payment for one person in our party as the owner called my cell phone AFTER business hours to collect.Huh?C'mon now.....have the business acumen to call someone for payment per YOUR mistake - during normal business hours. Not after. An absolute total waste of time. I felt bad for my guests who also had a poor time and felt largely the same (without having discussed any of this with them). I was embarrassed I brought them with me to this facility. Save yourself the time and trouble and visit the escape rooms elsewhere (we've been to a few in KC that were really good) and let this business reorganize their story lines, clues, management, and cleanliness first, before you spend over $20 for an abysmal waste of time. We would have asked for a refund but the fact that you get to walk in little-known underground tunnels...dating back to the late 1800s - was pretty neat and justified the price of admission, so to speak. Have low expectations and you'll be fine."
