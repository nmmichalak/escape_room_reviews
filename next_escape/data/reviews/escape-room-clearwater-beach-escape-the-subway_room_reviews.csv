"Escape room ""Escape the Subway"" by Escape Room Clearwater Beach in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-clearwater-beach-escape-the-subway,0,This escape game was amazing. There are TVs mounted in the walls that look like windows as the escape subway goes barreling down the tracks. All of the clues and puzzles were incredible as they activate mechanisms and lead you to the next clue. 5 stars!

We had a group of 8 people, including 3 teens. Everyone had a blast, but it only took us 22 minutes to complete it. It would be better if it had a few more puzzles to stretch the time to be closer to an hour."

We did the Subway room and I loved how immersive this was.If you have done an escape room before; you will absolutely respect the production value of this one. This is also a heck of a way to break into this awesome niche of entertainment.Drew was our game controller and he's as fun and as professional of a man I've met. He will ensure you have the tools to enter, and an experience you'll talk about to friends and family afterwards!Enjoy and good luck making it out!"
