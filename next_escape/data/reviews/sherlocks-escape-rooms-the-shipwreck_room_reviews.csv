Definitely will be back for another challenge..."

Most of us were first timers and had no idea what to expect. The experience was so great. Everything is appropriately challenging and well done. Our staff member, Grace, was an absolute rock star. I know for all of us today, we are looking forward to trying the rest of the rooms. Highest recommendation for entertainment in the Florence area."
