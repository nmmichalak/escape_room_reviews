"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Museum-Heist,0,"Thoroughly enjoyed the escape room today. This was our first try at an escape room. We had a group of 7 which included 3 adults, 2 teens, a 12 and 9-year-old. We did the Museum Heist room. The difficulty was hard for the 9-year-old to contribute much. While some of the props may have looked a little on the fragile side, they were fine and worked exactly as they should. The puzzles were challenging and everyone was able to contribute to at least one puzzle. We escaped with 9 minutes to spare and everyone wants to return to try another room. Definitely recommend giving it a try."
