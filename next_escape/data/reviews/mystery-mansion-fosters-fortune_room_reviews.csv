"Escape room ""Foster's Fortune"" by Mystery Mansion in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/mystery-mansion-fosters-fortune,0,"We did the beautiful Foster's Fortune room today. We found out some highly interesting information about Arkansas leading up to the room and then began the ""most challenging"" room in the Mansion. There was a LOT to do in the room, and that's about all I can say without giving away too much information. At the end, we didn't quite finish in time but we were allowed to go slightly over the allotted 60 minutes and complete it. I recommend definitely giving this place a try if you want a fun way to work your brain for an hour!"

We did the Foster Fortune room and it had tons of challenging riddles and clues that eventually led us to find hidden and ""illegal"" coins as well as the key to escape! A moderator watched on camera and gently nudged us in the right direction when we were struggling with the riddle or locks. My team finished in 1 hour and 2 minutes, the best time yet!"
