"Escape room ""Room X"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omescape-room-x,0,"As the first team that conquered the ""Room X"" within an hour, we considered ourselves lucky.  Soon after the game begun, you would realize not only the challenging puzzles but also the time and anxiety prevented you from escaping the chambers filled with secrets.  Boyz n gals, team work is the key but at the same time you do need to rely on individual's strength and weakness to work on specific tasks, so the more diverse a time is the merrier~ Great fun, staffs are very helpful, special thanks to Cindy. ""The incredible 8"" will soon come back to challenge the impregnable ""The penitentiary"".""At first, I was afraid, I was petrified.Kept thinkin' I could never EscapeWithout you by my side,But then I spent so many timeThinkin' how I did wrong.And I grew strongAnd I learned how to get along."""
"Escape room ""Room X"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omescape-room-x,1,"I have been here twice. I first played room x and then lab of bio hazard. My friend and I had sooooooo much fun! The puzzles need logics but not too hard to solve. There are a lot of high tech machines that we can play with. I had some other escape games experience before but i think this one is the BEST!!!! I recommend it to any one who is interested in solving puzzles and playing escape games. Besides, this place is also good for birthday party and you can also play board game in the second floor!!! THIS IS A MUST GO PLACE!!!!!!!"
"Escape room ""Room X"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omescape-room-x,2,"The place is amazing! I have played the Room X and the Lab on the sewerage system!! Both of them are  good story-telling game. I had truly REAL experience and the tech was beyond my expectation!  I ve been to many room escape games back in BJ, but nothing was like this! I really recommend this place for my friends!  Also, I heard the other game Prison can include 10+ people at the same time and needs cooperations and team spirit.It should be a great option to have team-buildings!  BTW The gamemaster was so cute~ LOl~"
