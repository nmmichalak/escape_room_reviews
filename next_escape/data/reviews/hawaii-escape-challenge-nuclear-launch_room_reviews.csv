"Escape room ""Nuclear Launch"" by Hawaii Escape Challenge in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/hawaii-escape-challenge-nuclear-launch,0,We had a great time at Hawaii Escape Challenge! We chose the Nuclear Launch theme and the room was very fun and the clues were tricky but easy at the same time. We highly recommended coming here!

That's how fun it was! The first time we did the Nuclear Launch and the second time we did the Cellar. We failed both times but it was so fun we'll definitely come back to retry them. Game Master Hailey was there both times we went and she is very friendly and super detailed about what the rules are. The rooms are so realistic, like you're actually trapped! It's great."
