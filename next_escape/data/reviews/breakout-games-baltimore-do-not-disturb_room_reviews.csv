I’ve done Do Not Disturb, Casino, and The Kidnapping and I’ve successfully made it out each time with our group! The staff is awesome and the rooms are challenging. I can’t wait to complete the rest of the rooms. Highly recommend for groups of 4+! Perfect rainy day activity and sometimes you can catch a good deal on Groupon!! Everyone must try an escape room at least once, they’re a lot of fun even if you aren’t great at puzzle solving!"
