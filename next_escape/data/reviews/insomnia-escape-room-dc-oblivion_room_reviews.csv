"Escape room ""Oblivion"" by Insomnia Escape Room DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/insomnia-escape-room-dc-oblivion,0,"Oblivion was pretty terrible. It took us less than 25 minutes to complete it and it was the first escape room for our group. Way too easy and not enough puzzles for the price. Plus, the puzzles werenâ€™t even interesting or challenging. Disappointed."

Very accommodating and patient with our large and raucous group. We had a great time and I can't wait to try the other rooms!"
