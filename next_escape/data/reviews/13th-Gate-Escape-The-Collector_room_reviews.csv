Although it involved a lot of yelling and frustration it was so much fun, and we did get to the last room! I'd definitely recommend it and I can't wait to do the others!"
"Escape room ""The Collector"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-Gate-Escape-The-Collector,2,This escape room was amazing. I drove an hour to play after playing the ones in my city. The environment was incredibly realistic and ever changing. I was with a team who had all played a game before and definitely challenged ourselves. The hosts are great and the sound quality from the Game Master is audible in each room. This was my first escape game with truly multiple rooms and must say I think I may be spoiled for other locations.

The tickets for the 13th gate were a little pricey but we're well worth it!!!! This haunted house is packed full of screams around every corner, each area based on a recognizable movie or theme, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The other part in the graveyard was even scarier, you have to do both!!! This was truly the best haunted house I've ever been to!"
