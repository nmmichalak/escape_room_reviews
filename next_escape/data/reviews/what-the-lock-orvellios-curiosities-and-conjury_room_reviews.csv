"Escape room ""Orvellio's: Curiosities and Conjury"" by What The Lock? in Manitowoc",https://worldofescapes.com/manitowoc/quests/what-the-lock-orvellios-curiosities-and-conjury,0,Six of us did the Orvellios room. It was the first time any of us had done an escape room before. It was incredible to watch how our minds worked as we all pulled together to solve all the clues. Definitely teamwork involved! I so want to go back to try and solve one of the other rooms!
