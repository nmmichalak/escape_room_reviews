I was the only one who hadn't done one of these before and absolutely loved it!! I was there with a friend of mine, another set of 2 ladies were there, and lastly a trio of people. It was very cool working with people you've never met nor know anything about to work together and try to make it out. Very well thought out puzzles some were easier and some really made you think. Highly recommend and plan on coming back again. Check it out you won't be disappointed! Don't worry if you don't have a full group half the fun is working with strangers."

Unlike any other escape room that I've done before. Very innovative and unique; a ""must play"" for any escape-roomer especially for those who lived (and remember) the '80's!!!"
