"Escape room ""PROstate Farm"" by Solve Who, LLC in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/solve-who-prostate-farm,0,"Absolutely fantastic! This is similar to an escape room game, but instead, you solve a murder. There are clues you have to find like blood, fingerprints, and a murder weapon. There are small details all over the place and it was actually funny as hell. The owners worked with actual detectives, forensic scientists, and the people who do autopsies! After you make your judgement and give your “verdict”, they go over how the murder transpired. It is split into 3 portions. First you investigate the crime scene, then you go over 3 interrogations with the 3 suspects, then you get all the evidence you found - back from the “lab” and an autopsy report. A really cool aspect, was that you report the evidence you find, so if you miss a clue, it won’t be turned back into you when you piece the mystery together with your group. I highly recommend this place!"

We had a blast! I was expecting another escape room which start to have the same repetitive puzzles to solve and was pleasantly surprised that this was different. You're solving a crime rather than trying to escape. We did the PROstate insurance room and there were three parts. First you spend about 20 minutes at the area of the crime scene and then you go to the interrogation room and then you debrief where you try to put together all the evidence to figure out who the murderer was. I really commend them on the way they have this laid out and everything was in great condition. They even gave us a camera to use to take pictures of the crime scene. There was a ton of humor throughout this and we got a lot of good laughs. This was an awesome time and I can't wait to go back and solve the other crime! We ended up solving the crime, but it was difficult and we missed a lot of clues along the way. If you're looking for a fun night out I highly recommend!"

We did the Prostate insurance murder.  The only thing is I wish we would have gone with a bigger group but we still did it. Its very difficult to solve but still really fun. Next time I would recommend the coffee shop.  It looked really cool."
