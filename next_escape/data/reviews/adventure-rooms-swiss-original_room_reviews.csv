"Escape room ""Swiss Original"" by Adventure Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/Adventure-Rooms-swiss-Original,0,"We had so much fun here! We did the Swiss room with four of us in total. The room wasnâ€™t THAT difficult, but still difficult enough to get your mind thinking. The staff member was extremely nice and very professional. Will definitely come back again."
"Escape room ""Swiss Original"" by Adventure Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/Adventure-Rooms-swiss-Original,1,I've been here 3 times. Great place especially if you're a beginner. The puzzles aren't too crazy. You definitely have to think outside of the box though. It would be a lot of fun for all ages. I love how the bookings are private. That's not something most escape rooms allow. I'll definitely return when they change their themes.

It definitely kept us on our toes and very entertained. It is a great team building event as well as a good afternoon with friends or even a birthday party! It is a must go!
