"Escape room ""Aunt Edna's Condo"" by Chico Escape Rooms in Chico",https://worldofescapes.com/chico/quests/chico-escape-rooms-aunt-ednas-condo,2,"We tried both rooms back to back. These rooms are well planned out and executed. They are both challenging yet fair with the appropriate number of hints for both rooms. Our family loves escape rooms and these did not disappoint. Don't miss out, try both rooms! I would suggest starting with Aunt Edna first, then go on to the more challenging Baker Street. Wonderful owner and awesome lobby puzzles!"
