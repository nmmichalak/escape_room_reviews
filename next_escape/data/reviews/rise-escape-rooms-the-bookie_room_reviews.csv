"Escape room ""The Bookie"" by RISE Escape Rooms in Tickfaw",https://worldofescapes.com/tickfaw/quests/rise-escape-rooms-the-bookie,0,So much fun! Great idea for our date night. The whole concept for The Bookie room was so cool and amazing how everything worked together to get you through the experience. Will definitely be back to take on the airplane and other rooms.
