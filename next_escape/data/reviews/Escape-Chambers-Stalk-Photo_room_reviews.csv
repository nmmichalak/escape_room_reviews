"Escape room ""Stalk Photos"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-Stalk-Photo,5,My sister and I paid a visit to Escape Chambrs. We had an awesome time. The scenario was very well put together. The only thing that I did not like the size of the crowd was too large. I think that people could have an even better experience if there were only six people in the room. Overall though it was a fantastic time.

It was awesome. So much fun to do with my family - we had a group of 10. We got so close to finishing and felt a lot better that only 20% miss the cops! James was an awesome host, funny and helpful! We will be back to try another room!! Highly recommend trying this out!"
