Thank you for the knuckle biting, teeth grinding frustration and relationship bonding fun....can't wait to try the zombie room next... .wonderful gift from a friend who knew just what I needed"
"Escape room ""Kidnapped!"" by Portland Escape Rooms in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Portland-Escape-Rooms-KIDNAPPED,6,"Did the ""Kidnapped"" room with the boyfriend, and 4 strangers, who came as a group. I was a little worried about working with people I'd never met before, but it was totally fine. We finished with 7 minutes left, and that was with us all working as a group.I would do this with 4 people, minimum. It may be a little too complicated for just two.Our moderator told us that the Kidnapped room has a 20-25% success rate, and that the American Revolution room is a bit easier.We'll be going back for the other rooms, for sure"
