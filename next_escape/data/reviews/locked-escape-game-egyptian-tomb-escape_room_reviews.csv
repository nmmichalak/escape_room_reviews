"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Locked: Escape Game in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/locked-escape-game-egyptian-tomb-escape,0,We escaped the Egyptian Tomb tonight for my son's 27th birthday and had a blast...It was fun and challenging. The staff is very friendly and made it even more fun. It was our 1st time and we will be back again.

So happy that they continue to grow and create more rooms for us to try. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good time. Will definitely be back for their Movie room soon.
