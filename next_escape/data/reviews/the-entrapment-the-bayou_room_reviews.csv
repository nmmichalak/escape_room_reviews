"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,0,My group of four did both Fogmore Manor and the bayou rooms. These rooms are done really well! We've done a bunch of escape rooms in San Diego and this one is definitely in our top 3 favorite places.  The tech in these rooms are really awesome! They are very challenging which we like but doable. We got trapped in both rooms but we're about a minute away from solving them so the owner let's us finish. The owner is really passionate about his rooms which is really cool. He designed and programmed everything himself which is very impressive. I wouldn't attempt this room with any less than 4 people because it is challenging. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to do an escape room.
"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,1,"We read somewhere that the Entrapment (Bayou Room) was a Top 5 Escape Room in San Diego so we decided to give it a try. We usually have 5 in our group but were missing our 5th this night. We were a tad skeptical upon arrival as their location shares a main entrance way with a car sales & sketchy massage parlor. It also had a strong smell of pets or the bad smell of a public bathroom. Then their guest waiting room was nothing to brag about when compared to the 20+ other escape rooms we've visited...That's where the negative observations stop. Upon entering The Bayou room, it was well designed/decorated, very interactive, and had a lot of variety involved to keep you interested the entire time! It wasn't a typical escape room where you have to open 20 locks to complete the game. Our game master had to inform us we were doing the right thing but gave hints if say something we're doing wasn't lining up quite right to obtain the desired result but this didn't detract from the overall experience. Teamwork is definitely needed as there's lots to do in there! In the end, it turned out to be a very fun yet challenging experience. Give The Bayou room a try if you want something a little different than you're accustomed to! You won't be disappointed."

We did the 90 minute Bayou room, and it was AWESOME! I loved how items could be reused and the puzzles were not like not typical and formulaic. You definitely had to think outside the box."
