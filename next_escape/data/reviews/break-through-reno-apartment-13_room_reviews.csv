"Escape room ""Apartment 13"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-apartment-13,0,"So much fun. If you've never tried an escape room, I highly recommend you grab a group of friends or family and head on down. We just did Apartment 13 yesterday and it was a great room. I would suggest this as a first room for people, or ask for the expert add-on if you've done these before. I'll definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Apartment 13"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-apartment-13,1,We had done the Viper room previously and did not make it out in time. Tried Apt. 13 last night and made it out with 4 min to spare! We had a lot of fun and the clue designs were really good!! Definitely would recommend!

Our game host was Tom. He was fantastic. We tried Apartment 13. We are not very bright when it comes to these rooms but we felt really good about how we did. We did not make it out but we are going to go back and try again and not ask for any clues to see if we can get out in less than 1 hour. The best part of our visit was Tom. He was always available and instead of actually telling us what to do next, he challenged us with a pun or a question that made sense to us. Tom was very accommodating. Thanks."

Literally the best hour-long activity I’ve ever participated in! We did Apartment 13 and we didn’t get out this time, but we were only a clue away! We will be back to finish it and do another room!"
