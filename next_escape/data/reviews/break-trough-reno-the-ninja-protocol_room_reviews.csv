Our first time, my girls and I beat the Ninja protocol with 9:25 left! I would do this again. Betrayal at high noon is the definitely the next one."
"Escape room ""The Ninja Protocol"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-trough-reno-the-ninja-protocol,1,I went with some friends tonight and attempted the Ninja room. It was so challenging and we had the best time. I'm hooked on escape rooms at Break Through!

We had two rooms, 5 in one room and 5 in another, betrayal at high noon and the ninja protocol and both teams escaped and had a blast doing it! The basic premise is that you have to use all of the clues around you to break out of the room. If you do not work together, you cannot get through many of the ""puzzles"" in the room. It's a great way to bond as a team! Would definitely do this with friends as a fun night out!"

I've done a few escape rooms in other cities, and these are FAR AND AWAY the best ones I've done. We just did our 3rd room tonight, The Ninja Protocol, and our guides were Bri and Cat. They were great!Definitely a great idea for fun/competitive people!"
"Escape room ""The Ninja Protocol"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-trough-reno-the-ninja-protocol,4,My friends and I experienced the Ninja Protocol room. We hadn't been here before so we didn't know what to expect. It was a ton of fun. We didn't escape but we are determined to do it again. I would recommend it to anyone. The price is great and the challenge is awesome.
