"Escape room ""Classroom Lockdown"" by The Excape Adventure in Modesto",https://worldofescapes.com/modesto/quests/the-excape-adventure-classroom-lockdown,0,I really enjoyed the escape room. It was exciting and fun. I honestly did not think I was going to have as much fun as I did mainly because I knew next to no one in my group but it was great! I recommend this activity to anyone looking for a fun hour adventure.
