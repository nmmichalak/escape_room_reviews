"Escape room ""Exit Protocol"" by SUBScape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/subscape-games-exit-protocol,0,"The last room we did was Exit Protocol.  We were told that this was the hardest room they had, and before we played, there were only 3 teams out of 25 that completed this room.  There is a lot to do in this room.  This is a great room for a diverse team.  There's something for everyone to do (puzzle people, people who are good at searching for things, etc).  It was definitely the most challenging out of the three we played.  We required 2 hints.  We did have an issue with one puzzle in the room.  Thankfully, our game master came into our room, helped us out, and gave us 5 extra minutes for our troubles, which was lucky because I believe we had 5 minutes remaining on our timer."

My kids took friends to SUBScape and went through the Exit Protocol experience. They were talking about it for hours after it was over as they had a great time. The place was nice, clean, and the staff we're very attentive. Was the perfect birthday experience for teens!"
