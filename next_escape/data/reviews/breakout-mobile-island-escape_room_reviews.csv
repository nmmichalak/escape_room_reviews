"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-island-escape,2,"We went to the Island Escape room. They had a really fun theme and room design and a lot of new and novel puzzles that were well engineered. The staff was friendly, engaging and on top of monitoring our progress. The communication was clear and easy to understand.Cons:Some of the puzzles were huge leaps of logic. One of the first ones took us about 15 minutes to figure out and we had to use one of our three clues. A few tweaks on it would have made it much more understandable. After we won, the room leader came in and told us that a lot of people get caught up on it. If that's the case, then it's probably the puzzle that needs fixing. I don't like the feeling of being stuck on the first puzzle! I wish they had given me a few more wins before a big stall.This experience puts this room at the middle of the pack of my escape room experiences, but I do hope they continue to refine the puzzles because the room could be great!"

We had so much fun with Island Escape that we turned right around and booked Operation Casino right after it! Our game masters were both amazing and I can't wait to try the other rooms!!!
