"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-Experiment,3,"Sure I'm a little biased as I helped build this...but I *wasn't* privy to any puzzles during my building! My group of five played thru it and it's truly Epic! So detailed, so clever and devious, very atmos-fear-ic!...I *HIGHLY* recommend this Attraction as an activity for Gamers, Thinkers, and Thrill Seekers of all kinds. No kidding. You really want to do this."
"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-Experiment,4,"I went in with a group of 10, and the experience was awesome. It's both challenging, and rewarding when your team work comes to a fruition. It's not exclusive to the super nerdy gamers, as I have only played a single video game in the last 10-11 years. There's a bit of an old school Resident Evil/Tomb Raider vibe, since you're looking for clues to move to the next step in the puzzle. If you can enjoy highly detailed, involving sets, have any interest in solving puzzles, and enjoy working with a group of some of your best friends to get to a finish line; you'll probably dig this game.I personally can't wait for their second game to open up later this month. I'll be calling all my friends as soon as it does."

"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-Experiment,6,"As far as having the ability to allow one to suspend disbelief for a moment in time, this place sincerely takes the cake. I was transported into another realm for an hour. The set design is on another level. The props and effects are admirably executed, and the gameplay itself is incredible. Thanks guys, what an experience! Can't wait to try the next one."
