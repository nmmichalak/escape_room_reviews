"Escape room ""Escape from Dino Island"" by Master Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/master-escape-room-escape-from-dino-island,0,"I love this place! I was visiting a friend in Boca, and when our evening plans went south, I suggested we do an escape room. TMER was amazing on the phone (we called within two hours of closing) and directed us to make an easy reservation on their website. I've done two escape rooms at two other businesses and the Dino escape room was truly outstanding. The puzzles were harder (and a little more temperamental) than some of the other rooms I've done in the past but we made it with a just a couple minutes to spare! A good game master can make or break an escape room, and we were lucky that our game master was following closely and was clued into some of the minor difficulties we were having and was able to help us out when we needed and asked for it.We did Dino with three people (one of whom had a little too much to drink at dinner and possibly made it a little harder at times ) and it was challenging. Go with friends ... I'd say your best bet is to do this room with 4-6 people!"
"Escape room ""Escape from Dino Island"" by Master Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/master-escape-room-escape-from-dino-island,1,I did my second room here. We did the Escape From Dino Island. I absolutely loved it. The room was really cool. The puzzles were fun and challenging. We had the maximum 6 people in the room and finished with only a few minutes to spare. I like that this room has challenging yet fun puzzles but is not impossible to pass. I would go back and do another room with them.

WOW! That's all I can say is WOW. I was floored and amazed!  Simply the best escape room I've ever done! The props, scenery and atmosphere were amazing. I really felt like I was in Jurassic Park!The puzzles were SO clever and unique. They were challenging, yet so rewarding each time a puzzle was solved."
