"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,0,"A Narrow Escape is a family-owned small business that offers three different hour-long escape room game experiences at a local N Semoran Blvd location. I took five teenagers in February 2018 for the Doctor Lycan room and they enjoyed it a great deal. They are pretty smart 13 and 14 year olds and they went until the very last second before escaping. Challenging but fun they said with a few creepy moments that appropriately played into the ""werewolf"" theme of the room. The owner and her family are absolutely amazing and enthusiastic about seeing their customers have a great time. We will definitely return. Check it out and support this small business while enjoying some brain-busting entertainment!"
"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,1,"We had a great time and managed to escape (with a few hints)! The Doctor Lycan room was well set up and the clues were challenging, especially for just the two of us. I can only imagine their other rooms must be super difficult!I loved how the owners were rooting for us to escape. Really fun to see their enthusiasm for what they've created as a family."
"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,2,"This new escape room is family owned and operated-they built it all themselves and did an amazing job. The employees are very nice and helpful. You will get more of a personal experience here than at the franchises and the high turnover style ones off of I Drive, where you are thrown together with people you don't know and rushed out the door to make way for the next group of way too many people crammed into a room together. This place is definitely worth the drive for both tourists and locals.All three rooms are great. My favorites were The Woods and Dr. Lycan. What I love about this place is the option for just a few dollars more to have a totally private experience without being paired with strangers. I feel like every escape room should do this, and they're the only ones in town that I know of that do."
