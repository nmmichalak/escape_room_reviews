"Escape room ""Murder for Hire"" by Escape Level 6 in Annville",https://worldofescapes.com/annville/quests/Escape-Level-6-Blue-Eyed-Six-Murder-for-Hire,0,"We chose the Murder for Hire room to celebrate my stepson's 16th birthday with a few members of the family (try something out of the ordinary). It was the first time in an Escape Room for all of us and we had a blast. Challenging, yet lots of fun and plenty of laughs! Cool, local small business, and we'll definitely return to try some of their other escape rooms! Thanks for a memorable day, Escape Room Level 6!"
