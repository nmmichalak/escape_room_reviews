"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/key-quest-phoenix-detention,2,"I took my daughter and three friends here for one of their escape rooms last night, and they had a great time. The Detention room was challenging, fun, and a great theme for kids (based on their words, since I didn't go in). Garret and Jesse were just amazing. I waited in the lobby while the girls were in the room, and between customers, the guys kept me company and then let the girls continue the room passed their time limit since no other customers were waiting. They were great with my group and from what I overheard, great with every other group. Super friendly and funny. They treat their customers like friends, which is perfect in that type of environment. Genuinely awesome guys, and even though I don't live in the area, I'll be returning just because of them."
