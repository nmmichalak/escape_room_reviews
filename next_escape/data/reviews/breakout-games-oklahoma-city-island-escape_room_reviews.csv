"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/breakout-games-oklahoma-city-island-escape,0,"This was a first visit to Breakout. We tried the island escape. It was a fun experience for all involved (ages 12 up to 77). It really did require working as a team to solve the clues (although we got some hints from Laura, who did a stellar job). This would even be great for companies as team building. Will definitely visit again."

My grandchildren enjoyed themselves and were engaged and intent on solving the mystery and were excited when we did with five seconds to spare.

We really enjoyed the Game Master and his helpful hints when we would get stuck for a few min. Donâ€™t be scared to ask for hints! This was all 6 of our first time doing an escape game and we loved it. Already thinking about which one we will do next. Great for a birthday or just going out for entertainment on a weekend."
