A bit creepy with great ambiance. A room full of antiques and mysterious artifacts. Some have meanings and others are for show. No hints or clues here. Just a great hour of enjoyment and surprises!

Our group of 4 had a blast! It was our first time doing an escape room, and we are now hooked. Very interactive and a lot of clues to look for. We finished with just under 8 minutes to spare. Staff was awesome and friendly. Highly recommended!"
