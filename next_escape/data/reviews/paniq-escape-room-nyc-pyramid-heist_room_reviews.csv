"Escape room ""Pyramid Heist"" by PanIQ Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/paniq-escape-room-nyc-pyramid-heist,0,"I've done a couple escape rooms before in NYC (and I work at one!) and this is the best I've been to yet. Beautiful design with challenging, unique puzzles and a sweet touchscreen communication interface. Also, the guy running the games while we were there, David, was awesome-- friendly and very helpful!"
"Escape room ""Pyramid Heist"" by PanIQ Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/paniq-escape-room-nyc-pyramid-heist,1,I love this place. I took my boyfriend here and we had such a great time. It's better with more people so everyone is thinking but overall it was supper fun and we will definitely go back. Prices are pretty decent too!!

I wasn't interested in trying anymore, but I'm glad I have it another shot.  It was TOUGH and actually challenging.  There were a group of us and we working together the whole time.  We figured out so many puzzles and clues and it was a fantastic time.  This renewed my interest in escape rooms and I am willing to go again!"
