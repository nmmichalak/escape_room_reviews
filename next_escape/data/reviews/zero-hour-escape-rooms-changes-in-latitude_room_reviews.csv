"Escape room ""Kraken the Case"" by Zero Hour Escape Rooms in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/zero-hour-escape-rooms-changes-in-latitude,0,"We went for the first time on Saturday. It was a quality made game. The Changes in Latitude room was an original idea. With well thought-out clues. The props made the room and immersive experience. I liked having a screen to support us rather than just an employee in the room, which we experienced at another venue. We needed 3/4 clues from the staff and we didn't escape. But we still had a great time. We look forward to going back again."
