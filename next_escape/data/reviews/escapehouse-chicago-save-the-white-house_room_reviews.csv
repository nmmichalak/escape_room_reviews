"Escape room ""Save the White House"" by Escapehouse Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapehouse-chicago-save-the-white-house,1,"This was our second escape room experience. I think we are hooked! I am happy to report that we saved the White House with 15 minutes to spare! The clues were not easy but not extremely hard, either. We all worked well as a group, and I think that is why we finished with time to spare. The staff was fantastic and played their roles well. We enjoyed Agent Mask's humor and wit! Next time our boys are in town, we are going to attempt to escape the Safe House!"
