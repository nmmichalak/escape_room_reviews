"Escape room ""DaVinci's Secret"" by Baffled Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/baffled-escape-rooms-az-davincis-secret,0,"We did the DaVinci room and it was a great experience. We thought the room could have been a little better decorated to give more of a moody feel to it. The clues were great and we liked that there were a few red herrings, it fit with the theme. We found the holy grail with 1:51 left on the clock."
"Escape room ""DaVinci's Secret"" by Baffled Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/baffled-escape-rooms-az-davincis-secret,1,My daughter and her friends did The Da Vinci room for her 15th birthday. This room was great for teenagers who had never tried an escape room before. The staff at Baffled were extremely friendly and helpful. Our group was very pleased and we are happy we chose Baffled for her birthday!

They have a very simple waiting area and small-ish room but it was great for the 5 of us and the puzzles/riddles were fun to solve. We got out of the room with 30 secs to spare. We'll definitely be back again!"

Vince was amazing, super friendly and helpful the entire way. We completed the DaVinci room and it is highly recommended. Puzzles are tricky. The 8-year-old in our group lost interest about 40 mins in, but the adults were engaged the entire time. Highly recommended."
