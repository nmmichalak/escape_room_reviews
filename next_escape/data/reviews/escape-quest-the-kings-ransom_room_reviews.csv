"Escape room ""The King’s Ransom"" by Escape Quest in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-quest-the-kings-ransom,0,"Glad to see others enjoyed this room but we did not. The clues were ambiguous at best and unlike some of the other reviews I’ve read, the “staff” was not helpful in “nudging” us in the right direction. Unless they felt repeatedly telling us to “use teamwork” in the final 5 minutes was supposed to be helpful. Uhh, thanks for the tip..."

Ended up being perfect because we played King's Ransom in our small group of 3 people. The staff was very welcoming. They were also super helpful if a clue didn't help, they would nudge you in the right direction keeping everything fun."

The six of us were paired with another couple to solve our Kings Ransom. We all worked together and solved it with over 25 minutes to spare. Highly recommend it.

A totally different experience from anything we have here in WV, and so much fun! We decided on the Kings Ransom, and it was pretty awesome. I want to come back and do the Black Widow game very soon!!"
