We did Oceans Royale, it is multi-room and so cool! The clues weren't too hard and the tricks that they had were top of the line. We got to crawl through lasers! How fun is that!"

We had a large family so it was great that it was so accommodating for our group size. The only downside is that the rules were a little confusing about having to walkie-talkie before we could type passwords in, in case it would lock up after too many tries. It left us feeling like we didn't solve anything on our own. It was a fun family day but it wasn't a 10. Very nice staff, thanks so much!"
