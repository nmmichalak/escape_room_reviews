"Escape room ""The Alchemy Lab"" by ClueMasters Escape Room in Fort Smith",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-smith/quests/cluemasters-the-alchemy-lab,0,"We enjoyed our evening at Cluemasters! It was fun for the whole family, teens and grandparents alike. The puzzles were challenging but solvable and the service was excellent. They were polite and helpful when we got stuck. The rooms, puzzles, and storylines were fleshed out and interesting. We are definitely coming back for a different puzzle!"
