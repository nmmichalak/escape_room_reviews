"Escape room ""UFL VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-ufl,0,"Shoutout to the guy who gave us last minute directions on where to park when we were rushing like crazy and to the other guy who let us still play even though we were 10 minutes late. I've never been checked in or onboarded so quickly and efficiently. (But try not to be late or else it eats into your game time... they usually have a 5 minute cutoff)We did the UFL game. Lots of fun and surprisingly tiring. We'll definitely go back to play again, it was really immersive and fun! Would definitely go again another time with a bigger group."
