This was my first time. My girlfriends and I did were victims of a kidnapping, very challenging! I've never felt more blonde in my life!

Definitely one of the harder ones that I have done so far. Everything was well designed and very well thought out. Kevin is a great guy, stop by and do a room sometime. I highly recommend it!"

Really works your brain and is a great thrill! We were blindfolded and handcuffed in the beginning which was a little scary but added to the theme.
