Let me just say if you take hormonal girls be prepared to tap into your inner Buddha because they can get sassy in these rooms. The actual place is really nice they thought of everything with the design in the waiting area/ bar. The room we played was really cool ,Budapest Express, we didn't make it out but we were one step away from escaping the room. This is a very well thought out setting and I highly recommend it!"

I  weren't able to complete it but still had a great time. Our host, Cris, was very friendly and helpful when we were first got into the room and were getting debriefed. Definitely want to play more rooms here"
