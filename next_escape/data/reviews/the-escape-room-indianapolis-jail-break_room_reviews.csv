My husband and I love doing these rooms! Stephany was a great room guide. She helped without giving too much away. We participated in the jail break room. Perfect amount of challenge! Wasn't too hard, but wasn't too easy! Will definitely be returning!"
"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by The Escape Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-escape-room-indianapolis-jail-break,1,We had a great time. I did Jail Break with two of my best friends/groomsmen as part of my bachelor party and we really enjoyed it. We completed it with 7 mins to spare. We felt like it worked out really well with there only being 3 of us instead of the max 6 that this one could hold. Highly recommend doing this.
"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by The Escape Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-escape-room-indianapolis-jail-break,2,We did Jail Break with Maria as our host. We had a fantastic time and very much enjoyed working through the puzzles. I found the puzzles at a comfortable level of challenge and Maria did an excellent job keeping tabs on us and giving us clues when we asked. This is the second room I have done and I have immensely enjoyed myself both times. I am looking forward to trying another of the rooms.

We plan to come back and do it again in February, hoping to once again emerge from the room victoriously. "
