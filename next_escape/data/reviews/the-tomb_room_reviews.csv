"Escape room ""The Tomb"" by Tomb Family Adventure in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/the-tomb,0,Horrible experience! After being told by the manager that my family of four may have an additional 2-4 people added to our group we then waited patiently for 45 minutes. At the time of entry we had a group of 11 walk in & where told we had to go in with that group making the number 15.  We then talked to the manager & was told we could wait another 2 hours! & go. I demanded a refund after I had two disopointed kids who where wore out from waiting . I then looked at the obvious fake reviews on their website that has no ways of adding real reviews. On vacation time is precious & this place wasted ours . 
"Escape room ""The Tomb"" by Tomb Family Adventure in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/the-tomb,1,Awesome time with the family. Nick our guide was very into the act and made it enjoyable for us all. My daughter got scared and he was great to calm her and allowed us to all enjoy the rest of the experience.

We expected more of an ""escape room"" feel; however, this was more of a guided story with a few puzzles. Our kids were 11, 13, and 14 and enjoyed it... my husband and I were enjoying watching them."

The puzzles are a bit more childish (especially compared to the average escape room), but they were still fun and different."
