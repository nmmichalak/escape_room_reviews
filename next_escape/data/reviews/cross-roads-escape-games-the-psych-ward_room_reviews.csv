"Escape room ""The Psych Ward"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/cross-roads-escape-games-the-psych-ward,0,"By far the best escape rooms weâ€™ve ever done. The production value is unreal. We did the psych ward and the fun house, both well worth the money."

After doing the Psych Ward yesterday I can totally see why they have 5 Stars. We did a family event that my brother had gotten us for a Xmas present and we had a total blast. The ""orderly"" that helps you totally stays in part through out the whole game and gently assists you when you get stuck which allows you to move along. So many different puzzles and clues and it keeps you on your toes. We are looking forward to going back and doing the Hex Room next. We totally enjoyed ourselves. It's also great for team building and we are thinking of coming here for a company event."

There are 2 escape rooms and a new game called the Psych Ward. Our family has done the hex room escape game twice, and last night took a crack at the Psych ward which creates 2 teams, 1 of the sane and 1 of the insane, and puts them together to collect points and try to win against the other teams. The customer service is hands down great, and everyone sticks to the character so well. The games are some of the most tricky and integrated I've played yet. The atmosphere is just fun!! Honestly if you want to have fun this is place to go."
