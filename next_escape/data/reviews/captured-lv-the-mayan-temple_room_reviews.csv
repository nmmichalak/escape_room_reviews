"Escape room ""The Mayan Temple"" by Captured LV Escape Room in Bethlehem",https://worldofescapes.com/bethlehem/quests/captured-lv-the-mayan-temple,0,First escape room experience for me and it was a blast! We had 7 people in the Mayan Temple and we made it out with 10 min to spare. Everyone in the group had a great time and would definitely do one of the other rooms they have!

Lots of problem-solving challenges and some cool effects made this room truly unique. Iâ€™ve done 50 rooms and this ranks in my top five for sure. Our game master was Adrienne and she was very helpful, encouraging and very much into her role. If your travels take you to the Lehigh Valley, make sure you stop in and try these rooms."
