"Escape room ""Escape an 80's Dance Party"" by Great Room Escape in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/room-escape-adventures-cincy-escape-an-80s-dance-party,1,"We booked the 80s room with DJ Dan (Lucas). This was our first escape room and we really enjoyed it! We appreciated having our host in the room to give us subtle guidance when we were lost lol. Once we realized what we should have been doing it was obvious we should have gotten it, but thats okay because we had a blast! Brought back a lot of memories for this 80s born ""oldie"", the music was GREAT - so glad there was music."

DJ Dan aka Caleb stayed in character the whole time. Hannah who also works there joined us to do her training and helped us a lot with the puzzles. We did the 80's escape. So much fun definitely would recommend to all go back again. Next time I'm in Cincinnati I will definitely be looking it up to go again.
