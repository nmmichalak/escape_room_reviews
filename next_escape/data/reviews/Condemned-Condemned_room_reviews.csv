"Escape room ""Condemned 2"" by NorCal Escape Co. in Yuba City",https://worldofescapes.com/yuba-city/quests/Condemned-Condemned,2,"This was an amazing night. Super challenging and time flew by so fast, we didn't even realize where it went! Our group of 4 worked great together on Condemned2 but it was too much for us to escape. This is such a great thing to have in Yuba City and can't wait to try it again!"
"Escape room ""Condemned 2"" by NorCal Escape Co. in Yuba City",https://worldofescapes.com/yuba-city/quests/Condemned-Condemned,3,"I did Condemned2 with my husband and some friends and coworkers. We were SO CLOSE to escaping! This room is absolutely superb, though; top notch set, immersion, puzzles, everything. The customer service is fantastic as well. Yuba City is a bit out of the way for us (an hour drive), but worth it! Definitely going back for Fox Tail and rooms to come!"
"Escape room ""Condemned 2"" by NorCal Escape Co. in Yuba City",https://worldofescapes.com/yuba-city/quests/Condemned-Condemned,4,We've done the NorCal escape rooms three times now (twice at Condemned and once at the Foxtail Saloon) and the newest Condemned two is top notch!! Super fun to get a group of friends to do it together! Already planning on going back when the next room opens!!

The facility is really nice, the owners were great but most importantly the room was freaking awesome! We took a group of 10 for my husband's birthday to do Condemned 2 and it was so fun! The puzzles were difficult enough to really make you think and make it exciting! Can't wait to go back and try their other room!"
