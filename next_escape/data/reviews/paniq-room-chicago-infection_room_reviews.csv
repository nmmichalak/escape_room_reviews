"Escape room ""Infection"" by PanIQ Escape Room Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/paniq-room-chicago-infection,0,We took our nieces here - it was a great way to spend time with them. The Infection room was a perfect introduction for them and their problem-solving skills were definitely up to the task! We finished with 16 minutes to spare! I would highly recommend this!!

Very addicting, we did Infection with just two of us. Couldn't beat the 60 minutes, but she let us go over and we did it in 64 minutes. Staff was outstanding and so helpful. Can't wait to go back!"

I would highly recommend this to everyone. We did the Infection Room and we cannot wait to do the Mob and the Prison rooms. This is absolutely a fun way to have a family/friend/group get together.
