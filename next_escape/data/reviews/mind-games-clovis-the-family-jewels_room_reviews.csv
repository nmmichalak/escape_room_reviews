"Escape room ""The Family Jewels"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-the-family-jewels,0,"My aunt and mom really enjoyed themselves and the experience of finding the family jewel. Check in was easy and the staff was very helpful and nice. The challenges were hard and you had to use your mind to figure out the clues and good teamwork with each other. Afterwards the staff was able to show us future games coming up, which made us want to go to another game. Had a lot of fun!"
"Escape room ""The Family Jewels"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-the-family-jewels,1,Celebrated my 12-year-old daughter's birthday there with 9 of her friends. They split up into two teams and did the Family Jewels competition. They were thoroughly entertained for the full hour. They had so much fun. They couldn't stop talking about it when they were done. Staff was friendly and accomodating! They want to come back for more!

The staff was very friendly and were very patient with us. Great sense of humor!! We had a good laugh.  Gave us enough clues to figure out locks. Come here for a good time then go have dinner and a drink or two!! We had 7 minutes to spare.

The puzzles they made for us were really fun and forced us to get witty and crafty. The room felt a bit small, but had an impressive amount of ""stuff"" around to keep us busy with everything. Definitely going to be trying to get a few other people to run another room with me some time."
