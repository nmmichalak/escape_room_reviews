This was our group's first time doing an escape room so we did not really know what to expect. We were all a little apprehensive at first but we had a blast. The clues were a little difficult and we really had to think but to us that was perfect. We actually got plenty of fun and excitement for what we paid for. If you are like ok'ing for an escape room experience, this one is top notch!"

Our ages ranged between 17 and 59. Everyone played a part in the breaking out process. We laughed at ourselves and marveled at each other's ingenuity and creativity. Definitely recommend!"
