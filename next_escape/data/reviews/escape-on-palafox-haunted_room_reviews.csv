It was SO MUCH FUN! It was truly an adventure that brought us together as a family.It was our first visit to Escape On Palafox and as it turned out we picked one of the hardest rooms. Clues provided along the way from the staff really helped us along and kept us from getting frustrated in this challenging room. We laughed and worked together and at times screamed (Haunted room). The laughter and joy gave way to positive family time the rest of the day. We look forward to trying out every room Escape on Palafox has to offer. Highly recommended! We Almost escaped!"

We did the haunted room and made it about 65% of the way through (our estimate) and still had a blast even though we didn't finish."

I definitely want to do the other 2 rooms now. We also did it with 3 women we didn't know and that made it so much more fun. I highly recommend doing the escape room!
