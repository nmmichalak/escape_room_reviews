"Escape room ""The Lair"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/thelair-escapedom,0,"So my friend, her father, and I decided that we wanted to go on a fun escape room on a Friday night right? The service and general idea of the room was supposed to be ""not scary"" and we supposedly played a kids version. Late into the game, we got stuck. We asked for a clue and the guide gave us false information and then said ""my bad"" at the end when we couldn't escape. If that wasn't enough, my friend was horrified even though it wasn't supposed to be scary at all. There were mangled dolls draped across the ceiling and eerie sound played in the background. You had to undress a Barbie to find one of the clues, which I personally find extremely disturbing. It was said that we played the kids version, however, many elements of it seemed more mature. We were really bummed at the end since we weren't offered a refund for the mistake that was made. They acted like the issue wasn't a big deal, but the ""customer is always right"". Please note before exposing this to your kids."

Out of sheer curiosity, I decided to make a visit and I was hooked right away. Since then it's my favourite escape room in Los Angeles, where we always have a lot of fun!"

I've done many escape games and this one had creative and unique puzzles I hadn't seen in the 30+ previous games I've played. It feels like a game, but there is still the pressure to beat the clock. I love the set up prior to entering the game. The staff is great and so is the experience. Definitely check this out if you want to have a fun time."

Our group of 4 showed up with no expectations and were pleasantly surprised. The puzzles are very well put together and required a thinking. Our group likes to power through things when we get stuck, but the hosts know when is the right time to offer advice! They are opening up two other rooms in the same location...I will be going asap once they are available!"

We didn't know exactly what to expect but ended up thoroughly enjoying it. I'd recommend it to groups of friends/colleagues who want to do something fun for a solid hour with no distractions except the mysteries you're trying to solve. The hosts were fun and entertaining and even spent time with us after to get our feedback.
