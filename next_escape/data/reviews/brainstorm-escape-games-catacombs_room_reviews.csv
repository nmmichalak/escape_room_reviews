"Escape room ""Catacombs"" by Brainstorm Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/brainstorm-escape-games-catacombs,0,"We have previously done the Area 51 room, and now went back with a group of six 12-year-olds for a birthday and did the Catacombs. It was just as fun as Area 51, maybe a little more challenging but the set up was so creative.  Everyone enjoyed it, and they made it out (with a little help from our game master!)."
