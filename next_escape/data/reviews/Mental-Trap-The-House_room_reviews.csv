"Escape room ""The House"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-House,0,"Wow! This was bad. This review should be 0 stars!!! Nothing worked properly and we were actually given the wrong equipment at one point! The intercom cut in and out, so we couldn’t hear any of the instructions that our game master was giving us. One of our clues did not work and we were given no extra time to compensate for the lost time due to equipment malfunction. We all wish we would have chosen another company!!! "
"Escape room ""The House"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-House,1,"This was the worst experience! We have done other escape rooms and loved them! The equipment didn’t work and Chad, our Game master, failed us. The look and feel of the room was great, but that’s where the positive feedback stops. There were so many problems, that it took all the fun out of it. It was a waste of our money and time! "
"Escape room ""The House"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-House,2,"There is potential for this to be a good escape room, but sadly it falls very short. It was so disorganized, the equipment did not work properly and the staff was not helpful. Chad was our “game master” and he did a very poor job. Two of us were put in the wrong handcuffs  at the beginning and could not physically reach the key they needed. Chad had to come into the room to unlock them, because of his mistake. He made a snarky comment about their inability to do it themselves, before realizing that the key they had did not work on their handcuffs. We were encouraged to ask for hints through out the game, but often he did not respond for long periods of time or not at all. When he would try to talk to us, the intercom system did not work properly. It cut in and out and was often inaudible. At one point, the clue we needed was on a VCR tape. The VCR would not play and after a LONG time Chad finally checked on us. He slowly walked in and messed with the VCR, only to tell us he had to get a new tape. He SLOWLY brought in a new tape. It turns out that it was the wrong tape!!!! It did not match the puzzle we had in the room, so we had no chance! It was very disorganized and Chad did an awful job. We wasted our money!!!!!"

"Escape room ""The House"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-House,8,The House was the first escape room I had ever done and I loved it. I couldn't stop thinking and talking about it for days. It's been a couple of months since I went and I'm planning how to get back for The Experiment ASAP. So much attention to detail in the rooms and a great atmosphere. A very fun way to spend time with friends.
"Escape room ""The House"" by Mental Trap in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Mental-Trap-The-House,9,"This was one of the most fun things I have ever done.We did ""The House"" room. We almost solved it. A few more minutes and we would have made it out. We did have a few clues from the host. Without those, it would have take a bit longer.Unfortunately, the nature of the game is such that you can't really do it twice since you'd know almost all of the clues. Luckily, they have another room. We'll definitely be back to tackle ""The Experiment""!"
