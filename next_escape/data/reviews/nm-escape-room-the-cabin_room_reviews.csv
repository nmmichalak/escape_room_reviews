It was so much fun, I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. We had a group of 7 and we did The Cabin, the hardest room there. We didn't finish in time but got the way down to our last clue. We will definitely be this again!"

We chose ""The Cabin"" - not knowing it was the hardest one! We needed about 5 more minutes or so and we would have had it though. It was tons of fun, and the five of us had a great time! My son is already making plans to return. I would definitely recommend grabbing a group of friends and heading over to the NM Escape Room!"

The experience is deliciously creepy, fantastically immersive (down to the temperature of the space), and enchantingly fun! My group lost (we were close), and we still had a blast. My wife's group came second, and they won. I was especially appreciative of the quick reset of the room in the tiny half-hour between my team and my wife's. Professional, creative, quick, and clever. Highly recommend!"
