"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,0,"I have now completed all the rooms they have at 3rd Day (for now!!) and I have to say that I love the new rooms. The asymmetrical racing room When Worlds Collide is such a fun competition. Be sure to get enough people to split into two groups because the racing component is incredibly enticing. But make sure to double book so the teams can switch rooms and do it again! I seriously loved both ""worlds"" so much that I would have been disappointed had we not done both in one day. Cool theming. Clever puzzles. Fun competition. The owner and all the staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. "
"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,1,"4.5 starsWe had a smaller group this time (4) compared to to our usual escape group but that wasn't going to stop us! The fates of two realms hung in the balance! We also happened to have two 13 year olds with us and one of them had no experience in escape rooms so we wanted a place that would be a good introduction. I was intrigued by the asymmetrical set up of the When Worlds Collide room. So much that it overcame my worries that it would be too much for an inexperienced player and such a small group. Without giving anything away, this particular game is set up so that two groups can play against each other! One in the ""Fantasy realm"" and one in ""Reality"". Its essentially the same story, and the groups don't really interact with each other except for the fact that only one realm can be triumphant. Other escape rooms I've played with two separate groups I'd consider a parallel setup because both groups play two copies of the same room, and whichever group finishes first wins. Here, whoever finishes first wins but the two rooms are completely different so if you are so inclined, you can come back and play the other side so try to avoid spoilers after your post game sharing! All this makes When World's collide a great option for a large group. Up to twelve people can play (6 in each realm). Or even as small a group as ours with some experienced players (2 in each realm). Or take your normal group and play each side on different occasions, that's an option as well! Thanks to our game master Chris for explaining and giving us our clues. We had a great time! The only thing that we noticed is that the temp could get a bit hot in the rooms so dress appropriately! I found that we were concentrating on our mission so intently that it wasn't all that of an inconvenience but I'm sure some would like to know."
"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,2,"I was in a group of 6 who did the When Worlds Collide room. We split into two groups of 3 and competed against each other - one group in fantasy and one in reality. We had so much fun that we went back the next night to compete again, with the teams switching rooms. I did the reality room the first night, which I thought was a bit more challenging than the fantasy room. We were on the last puzzle when the time ran out. The group in the fantasy room still had several puzzles left to get through. The 2nd night I did the reality room and we made it out with 12 minutes to spare. We had such a great time in both rooms, and the girls who worked there were fantastic. I don't want to say too much and give anything away, but if you have a large group I highly recommend checking out When Worlds Collide!"
