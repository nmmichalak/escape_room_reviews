The flow, the game guides and the customer service are all exactly what you would expect and want out of an escape room. If you have the chance to play this game, DO IT.

The puzzles made logical sense. The staff wants you to succeed! There are no limit to clues they give. We solved Captain Spoopy Bones with time to spare and no clues with six of us. We can't wait to go back again!!!

Good use of technology and puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. Staff were lovely, and the games in the lobby were a nice way to pass the time."
