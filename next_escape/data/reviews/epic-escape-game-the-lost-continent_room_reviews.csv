"Escape room ""The Lost Continent"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-the-lost-continent,0,Love this place. I've done the space themed room and The Lost Continent room. Both are fantastic! The Lost Continent room is amazing. Lots of cool puzzles and unexpected twists and turns. Definitely try this place!

Our group went in not having a clue what to expect. Who would have thought it would be fun paying to get locked into a room for an hour trying to figure out a bunch of challenging puzzle and riddles just to get back out!Super challenging and thought provoking. Took 53:11 to finish ""The Lost Continent"" which was one of the moderately challenging rooms.I am amazed by the prep work that is put into this and would recommend everyone to give it a shot especially with the crew here!"

It was a first time for all of us! Not only is it clever, it's fun, and the staff was so friendlyAnd helpful and really helped to just make this a great experience! And..... We escaped with 7 second to spare!"
