"Escape room ""Jumanji"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-jumanji,0,"Did this room with a group of 6 adults, cleared all three portions of this in 45 minutes.  Very immersive with good detail.  The puzzles are all excellently thematic and genuinely fun to solve.  My only issue with this room is when you are assigned character roles there is no way to reference what your ""specialties"" are.  If we had a prop of some kind that we could have referenced would have made things quite a bit smoother... maybe that's the point?"

The puzzles were very creative--you won't find locks and combinations here! The game masters really know what they're doing, and it shows because they have a total of 16 rooms! Because my experience here was so amazing, I'm definitely going to try the rest of their rooms! Rose was an amazing host and game master, and she was very kind and helpful. PS their ice cream is delicious!"
"Escape room ""Jumanji"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-jumanji,3,"My kids (ages 9,11 and 21) and I have done three 60Out escape rooms: Jumanji, Alice in Wonderland, and Fire & Ice. Jumanji is one of our two favorite escape rooms in LA, and Fire & Ice is our third favorite. These are high-quality escape rooms with strong production design and story. They are high-tech escape rooms with lots of magnetic-opens and pretty much no combination or key locks. If you like escape rooms that require you to find combination and keys to open locks, these are not your rooms. But if you like ""OH! THAT'S COOL!"" moments in your escape rooms, 60Out rooms are for you. All of the rooms we did were impressive and amazing, but HANDS DOWN, the Jumanji room will blow your mind with its production value, set design, script, and puzzles. Unlike linear puzzle rooms, several different puzzles can be done simultaneously in this room, which makes it fun for groups. We look forward to doing more 60Out rooms!"
