Be ready as you embark on a quest that is not only educational, but a ton of fun. code breaking, logical thinking, a great narrative and dancing add to the experience, don't let the family's heritage daunt your decision to try it out. No matter what your background is, it is an experience to remember."

A lot of fun and great service. When I first found out about the Jewish escape room I was like ""maybe its a little bit of a weird theme"" but after all I learned alot of new stuff about the shpola zeide which is a really cool guy. If you didnt come yet stop wasting your time come play the room. Excited to come back for the next room!"
