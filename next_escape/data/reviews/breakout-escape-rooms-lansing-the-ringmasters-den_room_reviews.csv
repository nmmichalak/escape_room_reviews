"Escape room ""The Ringmaster's Den"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Lansing",https://worldofescapes.com/lansing/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-lansing-the-ringmasters-den,0,"This was a waste of money.  Way way too hArd.  You stay in one room thru the whole game when other escape rooms have one clue that you find and then you advance to other rooms.Even at the end when the answers were shared, we realized there was no way we ever would have gotten the answers. It was a total disappointment. "

This challenge takes teamwork and out of the box thinking. Very fun, 10/10, would do another room for sure. (p.s. if you don't like clowns, this is not the room for you.)"
