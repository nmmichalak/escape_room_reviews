"Escape room ""Bloody Mary"" by Escape Countdown in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/escape-countdown-sarasota-bloody-mary,2,"Looking for something fun to do with friends, family, clients, employees? Got guests at home and it’s a rainy day or too hot? This is the place to go!Went for the 1st time this weekend with my husband. This is the smallest room, which makes sense to do it as it was only 2 of us. We worked well as a team (we have our disagreements very often at home). The staff is excellent, so helpful, the rooms are well done, easy access and no problem with parking. I’m not gonna lie, we failed... we ask for clues, but we couldn’t make. But it was sooooo fun! I can’t wait to go again and try a different room."
