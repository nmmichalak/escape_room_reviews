"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Philadelphia in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/the-escape-game-philadelphia-gold-rush,0,We had a great time playing the Gold Rush room! We went with a group of 6 and that was the perfect amount. Will be going back soon to try the other rooms.

I want to start off by saying I have done a lot of escape rooms, but this experience was an outstanding one. In the roughly forty rooms that I've played, The Gold Rush at The Escape Game in King of Prussia has to be in my top three rooms. I had a group of five adults total, and while the room says it can accommodate up to eight people, I wouldn't want more than six in this room. The spaces are very small.I wish I could remember our hostess's name, because she was lovely and I hope I have her for when I inevitably return to play all the other rooms. She really had a good feel for when we needed clues and when we didn't. She also kindly paused the game upon our request when we had trouble with a directional lock puzzle (we had to try it about 6 times until we got it to work correctly).We were led into a darkish room that was beautifully dressed as a rustic cabin front on a quiet evening in the mountains. We first had to break into the cabin, which took about fifteen minutes. Once inside the very tiny cabin, there were a handful of puzzles that were very appropriate to the theme of the game. We had guns and trophies to help move us along. I won't spoil the surprise, but finding (and getting to) the final room was one of the biggest highlights of the whole game.Overall this is a beautiful escape room with excellent attention to detail. If you're reading this review and considering going, do it."

We did Gold Rush and worked with another couple which I'll admit I was a bit skeptical about at first, but we ended up working together super well with the strangers and escaping nonetheless. The puzzles varied from pretty difficult to fairly simple and that led to a great rhythm of excitement and puzzlement. We took about 55 minutes of the hour they give you to solve the puzzle. I would definitely do this again and try out harder 'rooms'. As pricey as 35 dollars a person may seem (note: I am young enough that it is expensive in my opinion), I highly recommend these guys for any age group, any time!"

My family and I did the Gold Rush themed room and it was an awesome experience. It was challenging, but extremely immersive. The quality was top notch, almost Disney-esq. Sara at the front desk was super nice and extremely helpful! Ava (Eva?) was our guide and she was a fantastic host. She made the experience absolutely excellent! 10/10. We will for sure be back!"
