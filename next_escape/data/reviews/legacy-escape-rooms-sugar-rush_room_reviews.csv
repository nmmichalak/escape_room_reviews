"Escape room ""Sugar Rush"" by Legacy Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legacy-escape-rooms-sugar-rush,0,"Super fun for the whole family! We are always looking for family friendly escape rooms and this one is it! Sugar Rush was definitely challenging but super fun-not scary at all!  Our group ranged from a 60 year old to an 11 year old...and everyone loved it.  The room is decorated very nicely and the puzzles are challenging, but not too challenging to the point you get frustrated.  Our game master was Julie and she was very friendly and always ready with our hints (when needed).They have another room, Cabin 13, that we plan on trying next time.  Can't wait to go back!The only downside to doing this escape room is you'll want ice cream after!"

The Sugar Rush"" room was really fun, cute, and just challenging enough for the 8 of us. We were happy to successfully escape in time without any hints! Julie is super sweet and helpful!"
