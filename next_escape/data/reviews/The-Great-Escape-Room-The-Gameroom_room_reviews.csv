"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-gameroom,0,My brother and I had a fantastic time! The puzzles were very clever in the Gameroom and it was a good brain exercise. It was also good teamwork experience with people I didn't know beforehand. Katie was a phenomenal game master. Highly recommend!

Not as polished or high tech as some other competitors, but a really good time. Really makes you think and work with others. Enough going on that no one is left out. And we did escape!"
"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-gameroom,2,"We had 6 people in our room and escaped with 3 minutes to spare. It was really fun, not scary, but definitely engaging and would do it again. A little pricey for an hour's worth of fun so that's why we only gave it 4 out of 5 stars. They put a lot of work into the room and the puzzles were stimulating and kept everybody interested."

We went with family members 8-75. The Great Escape is fun for everyone! Spoiler: Stay organized, start right away but don't panic and remember- one hour to solve a puzzle with a bunch of other people is a long time. Don't be disappointed if you don't get it, you can always try another room another day. Great way to spend your birthday or get to know a team! Fabulous! Like a live video game adventure to bring out the detective in you!"
