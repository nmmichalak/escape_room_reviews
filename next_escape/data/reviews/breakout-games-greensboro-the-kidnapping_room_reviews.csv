We (3 teens and an adult) did The Kidnapping room and what fun! From being handcuffed and blindfolded to figuring out all those clues it was a barrel of laughs along with really making us use our brains and sleuthing skills. Our game master was very kind with us and she was great about offering clues without giving us too much information.
