"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Rockwall in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapology-rockwall-budapest-express,0,"Had a wonderful time with Escapology. Was in town visiting family and we decided to partake in the ""Budapest Express."" Five adults, one very active seven-year old, and we made it out with just minutes to spare! Room was wonderfully designed, and being able to stay at Shenanigans for video games and dinner was a plus. (A bit challenging for a seven year old, but we worked to keep him involved and he LOVED it.)"

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and my wife was allowed to wear our baby inside too, which was a big plus for us!!!! Great job!!!!"
