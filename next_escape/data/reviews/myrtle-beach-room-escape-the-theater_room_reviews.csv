"Escape room ""The Theater"" by Myrtle Beach Room Escape in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/myrtle-beach-room-escape-the-theater,0,"My family of four just completed the Theater escape.   We had so much fun and it took all of us working together.  It's well-designed and challenging - felt like we were placed right in the on-line games.  My daughter said it was the best part of our vacation. Looking forward to trying the Zombie room.  I suggest taking a small note pad and pen.  It wasn't necessary, but did help.  We highly recommend you give it a try."

My husband and I really enjoyed the theater theme. We were paired with another couple. We worked very well solving the riddles and found your attempts entertaining in itself. Great with couples, children or a large group."
