"Escape room ""The Vampire's Tomb"" by Lock & Key Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/lock-n-key-the-vampires-tomb,0,"Four of us went this evening to attempt The Vampireâ€™s Lair. We went in hoping to solve it, but not really expecting to be successful. We were greeted promptly and briefed on what to touch, what not to touch and then we were led into the chamber. We were delighted to see the room was clean, and attractive. A few of the clues had us stumped and we got notes under the door, but we persevered and we were successful. This escape room is our favorite so far, clues were well thought out, objects were well maintained, and we got just enough help to make it a success. Thanks!"
