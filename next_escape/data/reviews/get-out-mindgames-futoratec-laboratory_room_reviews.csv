"Escape room ""Futoratec Laboratory"" by Get Out Mindgames in Pittsfield",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsfield/quests/get-out-mindgames-futoratec-laboratory,3,Incredible game. I've only played a few but this was much better than the others I've played. Lots of secrets and surprises and it wasn't so impossibly difficult that you'd just get stuck. We barely got out.

What a fun experience and definitely way harder than I thought it would be. We all contributed something and made it out in about 36 minutes! Would recommend this experience and can’t wait for a new one so we can go back!
"Escape room ""Futoratec Laboratory"" by Get Out Mindgames in Pittsfield",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsfield/quests/get-out-mindgames-futoratec-laboratory,6,"They were very accommodating for scheduling a time and date. The front entrance is nice. The escape room when you first walk in seems small, sparse, and kind of run down, but as you begin the challenge and make it to the secret room it’s more exciting. It’s different than some of the other rooms we’ve done. All in all we had a good afternoon and will go back when they open the next room. He said it would be like a horror theme so we’re excited to give it a try. It’s nice to have one in Pittsfield and not have to travel an hour to do an escape room. I would recommend keeping to 6 people or less due to the space."
