"Escape room ""Tesla's Mystery"" by International Quests Escape Rooms in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/international-quests-escape-rooms-teslas-mystery,2,"Did the Tesla Room; group of 5 (ages 18 to 50 something). Puzzles were very challenging but not completely impossible and lots of fun! We had an absolute blast! We did utilize 2 of our clues and the game master, towards the end, assisted by telling us to review the one puzzle (without giving anything away). We did complete with a few minutes to spare! Looking forward to returning in the future to complete the Circus room! Props and decor absolutely beautiful! Well worth the cost for a evening of fun!"
