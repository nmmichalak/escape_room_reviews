"Escape room ""Granny’s Creepy Secret"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-grannys-creepy-secret,1,"My family and I have consistently had a great time at Challenge Accepted.  It's well-maintained and great staff.  Katrina, in particular, was wonderful during a recent visit.  Very friendly and helpful.  Challenge Accepted offers multiple Escape Rooms of various time/skill levels.  This last is particularly important, as my wife and I did a longer, more complicated one with our kids which we very much enjoyed--but also my Mom has taken my kids to 3-4 other, shorter ones set to their skill level and not only were they successful but everyone (kids aged 8, 12) was made to feel like their contributions were valuable.  To me, that is key to having an enjoyable escape room experience."
