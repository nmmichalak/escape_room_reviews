"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/breakout-games-oklahoma-city-museum-heist,0,My mom and I did the Museum Heist and loved it. Tony B. was our game master and he was very helpful and friendly. I'm glad we came to Breakout for my mom's first escape experience and we will definitely be returning.

It was truly a fun experience for me, my brother, my 2 kids and his 2 kids. What a fun family time we had!!!!"

We have only been able to brake out of the Museum Heist. It's so fun though. We tried to pick up clues from the first 2 to help us with the 3 one. It did, in a way. You really have to 'think' when you're in the room. We get so pumped doing it. We're like little kids and get so excited when we are able to find clues. I love it when things 'fall out of the ceiling' or a secret door opens. You just have to try it!!"
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Oklahoma City in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/breakout-games-oklahoma-city-museum-heist,3,This was our first time at Breakout games and it wonâ€™t be our last. We did museum heist and it was so well done. We did require hints but we were so close each time. Loved it!

Each of us worked both together and separately to solve the combinations to all the locks, other codes, and one puzzle required to get out! You couldn't skip over anything! Plus, we were so blessed to have a game master watching and listening to us over a closed-circuit television to give us hints along the way. Without her, we never would have escaped within an hour! As it so happened, we barely made it out in 58 minutes and 8 seconds! It was so much fun! I highly recommend it!"
