It's not the hardest room but it's not the easiest either. We are experienced at doing escape rooms and we were able to complete the room in record time with a few hints. I think this is a perfect room for kids. I look forward to their next one."

My best friends and I were able to escape the Wizard's Tower room with some hints from the friendly staff. Woohoo! Great work on this room! I really felt like I was in another world. We will definitely be coming back and will be spreading the word! Thank you for an amazing time!"
