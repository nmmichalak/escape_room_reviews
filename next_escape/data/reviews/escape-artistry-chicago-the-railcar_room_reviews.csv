"Escape room ""The Railcar"" by Escape Artistry in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-artistry-chicago-the-railcar,1,"The clues were very disorganized and not very creative.  Basically, you only need to unlock combination locks with numbers.  It wasnt really a railcar, but a big grey box made out of wood.  Some of the clues were very confusing and once figured out, we had no idea what lock the clue would open.  Some of the 'puzzles' didnt even work.  We were disappointed and would not recommend this particular one."

(Yes, I'm bragging, but just a little.)Highly recommended for ages 13+ (or younger kids who really love puzzles). We'll definitely come back to Escape Artistry with more friends when they design another room"
"Escape room ""The Railcar"" by Escape Artistry in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-artistry-chicago-the-railcar,4,My team's time in The Railcar was one of the best room escapes I have ever done. It was the first one to have a story being narrated you as you are solving the hints and clues on how to escape. The puzzles and riddles were genius and well put together. I will happily attend their next escape room!Thank you!

An activity for all of my introverted friends (this introvert included) to come together and use their brains! This was a tremendous amount of fun! Something different, quirky and quite amazing really. People are capable of amazing things, like building this puzzle room. Wonderful experience!"

"Escape room ""The Railcar"" by Escape Artistry in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-artistry-chicago-the-railcar,7,"I got hooked on room escapes about 2 years ago in Chicago and have been waiting for a new one to open up ever since. Railcar is in one of my favorite neighborhoods (Wicker Park) and is incredibly easy to get to via the el or bus - it's at 6 corners in the Flatiron Arts Building. Wicked fun experience in a room that is sourced locally, operated by fun staff who have a flare for service and making the room more interactive than some I've been to, and completely Chicago-centric. Chicagoans are proud of Chicago and this room escape is fun, challenging, playful, and utilizes clues that are a great blend of hands on and are extremely cerebral. I LOVED that there was enough work to go around and I was never bored. This is a must do for date night or for your first time in Chicago."
