You really need to look everywhere and at everything. Exercises the brain! Our group was in the Emergency Room trying to get antivenin for a snake bite victim. Unfortunately, the victim didn’t get his meds. None of us are doctors or detectives, and the victim is fake, so, it really didn’t matter! But it sure was fun!"
