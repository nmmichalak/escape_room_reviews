"Escape room ""Bootlegger's Breakout"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-bootleggers-breakout,0,"We were visiting family in the Denver area, and we really wanted to do a escape room. We found this place only 5 minutes from our hotel. We were a group of six, and four of us had already done an escape room before. We all loved it and had fun. It was a little pricey, but worth the fun. The lady there was super nice and helpful."

Family of 6 (our youngest is 16) did the difficult room and had a great time. The owners were very nice, explained a bit about everything then put us in the room. A very good experience for all of us. I would recommend this and would come back again"
