"Escape room ""Lunar Lockdown"" by Bull City Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/bull-city-escape-the-90s-room,0,My son and five of his friends did the Lunar Lockdown for his 16th birthday and they loved it! They said it was more fun than they anticipated it would be. Next time it will be the parents turn!

It was a great combination of fun and challenging. Our hostess, Pooja, was great. She was always there with the right amount of encouragement (and hints when we needed it). I think it was the easiest room, and we all agreed we have to come back and do this again! We spent about an hour and half talking about the experience afterwards!"

"Escape room ""Lunar Lockdown"" by Bull City Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/bull-city-escape-the-90s-room,3,"Really entertaining group activity. The puzzles were very intriguing and well thought out. It reminded me of playing mystery games on the computer as a kid, but in real life. Totally worth every penny for this awesome one hour adrenaline buzz."

We talked about it the whole way home and what we could have done to do the puzzles faster and better! A great activity for couples...if we had more people it would have been easier and faster but was totally worth the experience for us to do it alone...after all, marriage only works if the two people involved learn to rely on each other!"
