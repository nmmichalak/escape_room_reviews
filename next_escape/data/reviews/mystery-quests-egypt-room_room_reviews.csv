"Escape room ""Egyptian Heist"" by Mystery Quests in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/mystery-quests-egypt-room,0,We used two rooms with our large family group during our recent trip to CO Springs. The rooms were both well thought out and challenging for escape room newbies as well as veterans. We would absolutely return to take on the remaining rooms. Highly recommended!
