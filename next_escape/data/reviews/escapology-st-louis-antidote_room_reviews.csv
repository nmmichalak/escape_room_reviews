"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology St. Peters in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escapology-st-louis-antidote,0,"We had a blast and discovered our ""kids"" (20 & 24) have some made mystery-solving skills. It took teamwork as a family (and a little help from our awesome Game Master, Sam!) The escape room was unlike anything we have ever done as a family. We definitely want to do this again."
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology St. Peters in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escapology-st-louis-antidote,1,"We did the Antidote room, noted as their easiest, though it was definitely challenging. Gathering clues, finding keys and deciphering codes for locks, figuring out hidden messages and tasks - so neat. Essentially, we were in a laboratory, with a TV near the door that displayed the time we had left throughout the session. I won't go into any more detail, as it would spoil the fun! One item in the room was malfunctioning slightly and that set us back a few minutes at the end, but we mentioned it to our host, as well as noting it on the electronic survey we took immediately afterward, so hopefully, it won't trip anyone else up going forward.We posed for our victory pic, putting on/holding a couple of costume items from a big trunk near the check-in desk, as well as a small dry erase board that we could write on. Super fun idea and certainly, an A+ for branding!  Escapeology is a pretty new part of the Kokomo Joe's facility. It's very nicely put together. There were two of us in the room; I think to have more than four people in that particular space, imho, it would have been kind of chaotic. It made for a fun rainy day date and would be perfect for a small group of adults: friends or co-workers! "
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology St. Peters in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escapology-st-louis-antidote,2,"This was the first escape room for me & my wife, as well as the four 12 year old boys at my son's birthday party. Staff was friendly & helpful and check in was smooth. Don't bother to check in and fill out waivers online ahead of time. It is actually faster and easier to do it on site with their iPads. We started our game on time. Because we had lots of kids we played the easiest room, Antidote. I found the scenario to be immersive and realistic. At a few points the scenario was a bit TOO realistic for some of he kids (but great fun for me). The difficulty of the puzzles was about what I expected. The room was much more elaborate than I expected.  Because of the age of our group, the Game Master probably gave us more assistance than he would to a group of 6 adults. It helped keep the scenario moving and kept the kids engaged. I recommending discussing the level of assistance you would like with your Game Master ahead of time and I'm sure they will accommodate. Overall it was great fun and I'm sure we'll be back. I'm hoping to convince my employer to do a team building event there. Two minor quibbles:  One of the locks was a bit tricky to open, even when you entered the correct combination and one of the visual puzzles was darn near impossible to solve, even when you knew how it worked and what you were looking for. In each case our game master (who appeared to be paying close attention to us the entire time) gave us enough assistance to avoid too much frustration. This facility is brand new so it's not surprising that everything isn't quite perfect. I think both of these issues are fixable and I would expect them to be resolved over time."
