"Escape room ""Mission: Bluelist"" by Blue Ops Mission in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/blue-ops-mission-mission-bluelist,0,"We did the operation Bluelist over the weekend and it is really fun - but its HARD. Granted, we had 6 adults and 3 kiddos under the age of 15, we definitely got stuck a few times. A word of advice: the goal is using 3 hints or less, but dont be afraid to use a hint or two early on. Get past a few locks and codes quickly because there will be ones that will be way more challenging.Ownership is really great, staff is all friendly and nice. This is a veteran owned company, that alone is why i will be back. We are going to get a group together to try another one.Thanks Blue Ops!"
