"Escape room ""Neverland"" by Once Upon An Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/once-upon-an-escape-neverland,0,Neverland was awesome! Definitely needed all of us (6) to escape. Fun for teens and adults. I wouldn't reccomend for young kids just because they won't be able to get a lot of the clues.
