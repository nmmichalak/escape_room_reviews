"Escape room ""The Magician's Menagerie"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escapism-portland-the-magicians-menagerie,0,"First, I'll say that our game master was great. I can't remember their name, but they stayed in character, and they also gave good hints that still made you think.Overall, my biggest gripe with the room is with the amount of locks. I can understand having a lock or two in a room, but I think this one had around 10, which kind of ruined the room for me.The other puzzles were fun, and I liked that there were some elements that i haven't seen in other rooms i've done before.I'd recommend it overall for someone that doesn't mind locks and wants a harder game, otherwise i'd look for a room with more advanced and creative puzzles."

Fun, different, challenging, and brain stimulating.  Kids had a great time and wanted to do it again.  We had to use hints throughout but it was still a lot of fun.  Will look to do another one soon.   Highly recommend.  Guide did some extra magic tricks for our kids which made it really entertaining.  Thanks for a fun time!"

We thought it might be cheesy but it was so well put together and elaborate! Our host, Stavros, was in character and so nice and helpful when we needed a hint.We ended up solving the room JUST in time, Stavros actually walked in RIGHT as we figured it out! It was exhilarating and we kept talking about for the rest of the day. Now we want to go back and do all the rooms!"
