"Escape room ""Zombie"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-zombie,0,"It was fun, pretty challenging at the medium level but it was my first time. Worth it. I did the zombie room."
"Escape room ""Zombie"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-zombie,1,"Let me just say from the point of walking in, you'll fall in love with the decor, absolutely beautiful. My friend and I did the Zombie themed room, and believe me when I tell you this room is not easy at all, but fun once you figure out the clues and you progress through the puzzles. Didn't make it out in time as we had 2 puzzles left, but it only makes us wanna come back and try another room. The teammate Rebecca was awesome! She was very friendly and you could tell she loves her job! We'll definitely come back because she insists that Daycare will give us an experience we won't forget. Thanks Escape Hotel and Rebecca!"
"Escape room ""Zombie"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-zombie,2,We had a great time here!! The hotel itself is beautifully done and the staff were all so nice!! It was harder than we thought. Which is a good thing! We did the zombie room and it was a blast. Definitely need three people for it. We're looking forward to going back and trying a different room!! Have fun!!!
