This was our first time here, and we would definitely return. Escape Room Games has professional and friendly staff, as well as a great location with a nearby coffee shop/wine bistro/restaurant."
"Escape room ""Through the Looking Glass"" by Escape Room Missouri City in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-room-missouri-city-through-the-looking-glass,2,These escape rooms are so much fun!! I've done quite a few escape rooms in California and took a bunch of first-timers to here when I came to visit in February -we did the Baker Street one - it was challenging but so much fun!! This time around we did the Looking Glass which is now my new favorite room - the room is super cute and well thought out. Definitely recommend this place to newcomers and experienced ones
