"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Canton in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-canton-the-heist,0,"Went there for my son's birthday, he's 33 lol, angry with friends and family, we did the 60 min heist room with 9 people, it was fun and team building-esque ...we worked (almost) together, lol, and escaped with 3 minutes to spare, my only critique would be That it would be a better fit for 5 to 6 people as opposed to up to 10 ...it was very fun and even a bit rewarding ...we will be back !!!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Canton in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-canton-the-heist,1,"We did the Heist room, it was challenging but really fun. My only complaint is that we were sat in the waiting room for about 20 minutes with no employees around, we actually had to let 2 more groups of people in the door because no one was around to answer the door.I get it tho, they're busy setting the rooms up. But other than that, it was a great time. Will definitely be back again."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Canton in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-canton-the-heist,2,"A group of five of us recently completed the Heist. We arrived early to our scheduled appointment and were taken to our room promptly at the scheduled time with an additional group of 4...fair warning, you do have a bit of a walk through the Factory of Terror, which is currently closed-so it wasn't that bothersome, however it was very cold and most of us wished we had kept our coats on. The clues were challenging enough that we had to work for it but not impossible. We had a good time and will be back."
