"Escape room ""Runaway Subway Train"" by Escape Virtuality in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-virtuality-runaway-subway-train,0,Fantastic experience! The staff are extremely helpful and make for a great time. We really enjoyed ourselves and can't recommend this place enough. The subway train escape room is the best escape room we have ever done.

I walked in and it felt very hi-tech and modern. There was a group doing a virtual escape room and it was so cool to see what they were doing and also laugh a little at how silly they looked. I went with a group of 8 for a Groupon for the runaway train room. We were escorted into the escape room and was told we were to split our group of 8 into two. We were told that we would be meeting each other shortly so it didn't matter that we'd be split up. However, that wasn't the case for our group. It was a very challenging but exciting room and there were visuals that helped simulate a moving train. We ended up meeting up and escaping near death with only a few minutes to spare(not without some help with the game masters). I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and I'd definitely come back to try the other rooms."
