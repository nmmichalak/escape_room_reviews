"Escape room ""The Nightingale"" by Golden Puzzle Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/golden-puzzle-room-the-nightingale,0,Such a great escape room! My wife and I have done 7 escape rooms in various cities across the U.S. and this is one of the best.  We didn't see any spots open online to buy a time so we called and the owner was very accommodating and fit us in. We did the Nightingale room and it was a great challenge even for folks who have done escape rooms before.  All puzzles are very well done and require lots of thought.  Props are high quality and you can tell lots of thought went into creating the room.  We would recommend Golden Puzzle Room to anyone looking for a great time.

The Nightingale was a fun and challenging room for two people. We didn't win, but were close (with some hints) and still had a really good time! I like that they give you clues when you're stuck, so you aren't wasting your time on one thing for your hour. Really like that you're not paired with other groups too. Will definitely be back to try the other room!"

Arwen was such a great cluemaster and her hints were just enough to help us get to the next step!  The puzzles were very creative and we could tell a lot of time and effort went in to putting them all together.  Thank you!
