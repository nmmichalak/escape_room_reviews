"Escape room ""Spy Chambers"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-spy-chamber-1,0,"This was our third time visiting the clue room since they opened a few years ago. Their rooms and puzzles never fail to provide us with laughs and provoke thought. Truly well designed experiences. Other live escape rooms tend to have condescending staff members, but this one is quite the exception! The owners are very nice and helpful and always have been. This time, they had a new employee who was kind, helpful, and addded even more to an already outstanding business. Well done, Clue Room, well done!"

The themes were appropriate for young kids (a 9-year-old), which is what we were looking for. It was a difficult puzzle, but I guess that is what keeps you coming back. Recommended for a family activity."

We missed an obvious clue and needed a hint to make it out in time, but we had a blast! The clues really do require everyone to work together to get them all solved in the hour time limit. "
