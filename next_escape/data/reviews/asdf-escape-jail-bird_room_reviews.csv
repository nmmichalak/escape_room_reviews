"Escape room ""Jail Bird"" by ASDF Escape in New Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/new-brunswick/quests/asdf-escape-jail-bird,0,"I have done five rooms before, some fancy, some not so much. I have to say this was very very low budget. Escape rooms are fun in general and this one was okay for first-timers. But if you've done any other escape room before you will find this one falls very flat and not much imagination went into the design at all."
"Escape room ""Jail Bird"" by ASDF Escape in New Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/new-brunswick/quests/asdf-escape-jail-bird,1,Came here for the Jail room. Without giving anything way it was a pretty good time. The only negative was that one of the keys was not in the proper place so it made delays somethings but we finished early. I think depending on your group you could have a really fun time or maybe a stressful time. We had a blast but I could see people not getting along who don't know each other.The staff here was pretty friendly and went over everything pretty thoroughly. They explained the clues and how some things work and how other things won't be in the game.It was a pretty fun experience. Make sure you check in to get a free clue.
