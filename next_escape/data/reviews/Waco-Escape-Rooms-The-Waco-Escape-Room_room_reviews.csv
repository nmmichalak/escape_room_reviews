We got a group of 6 together for my birthday on Sunday and did the Waco Room. We didn't get out, but it was so freaking fun! We can't wait to come back we just can't agree on a di over or a different room lol! Too much fun!"

This was by far the best one!!! We were amazed by the intricate design and thoroughly enjoyed our time. We took a large group-9 and were challenged. It took all our talents and we probably couldn't have done it with a group of 4. (We did code breaker) Very affordable fun- we are still raving about it!"
