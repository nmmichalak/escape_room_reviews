"Escape room ""Betrayal"" by Exit Games in Bonner Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/bonner-springs/quests/exit-games-betrayal,0,I had never done an escape room before. We did the Betrayal room. This was really fun and look forward to trying the Exam room sometime soon.

The staff are probably the nicest and most accommodating we have experienced and the room was just challenging enough to make you think and use teamwork, but attainable enough to escape. Can't wait to try their other room sometime!"

The owner was very friendly and really went out of her way to make sure we had a good time. Can't wait to come back. Highly recommend this for a fun outing with friends and/or family!
