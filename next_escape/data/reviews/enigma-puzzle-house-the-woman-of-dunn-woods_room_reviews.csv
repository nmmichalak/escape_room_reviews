"Escape room ""The Woman of Dunn Woods"" by Enigma Puzzle House in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/enigma-puzzle-house-the-woman-of-dunn-woods,0,"Hard, but it was a blast! Went out with some friends from work, cause we'd done escape rooms around here before, and wanted something more challenging. We were NOT READY. Every puzzle was connected and felt like it belonged there. Indiana has a lot of bland ""escape rooms"", just a generic theme like ""Outbreak"" or ""Prison"" with a bunch of store bought puzzles. But Scott and Dave(?) chatted us up after we were done and explained how they did it. BravoAfter having barely gotten out, I can say I definitely I got my money's worth!We'll be back!"
