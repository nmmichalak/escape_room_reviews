Few options for escape rooms but plenty of hard thinking puzzles, codes are unique , and the escape rooms are so different!! I loved the experience with the help of the employees as well. One great employee was Soncee! She was so kind , loud and great greeting, extremely helpful and knowledge me on what I was going to do. I definitely applaud her for helping out everyone at the lobby as it seems stressful to do so !! 10/10 Place !!!!"

But despite not knowing what to expect and even what to do, we managed to open 4 out of the 5 locks. Our GM was super cool and he gave us pointers when we got too off track. We had an amazing time and since we came so close, we will definitely be back to try our luck in the other rooms! Thanks Breakout Waikiki for making our double date a success!!"
