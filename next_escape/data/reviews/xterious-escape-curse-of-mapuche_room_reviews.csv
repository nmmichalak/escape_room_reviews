"Escape room ""Curse of Mapuche"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-curse-of-mapuche,0,"A friend of mine who is an escape room aficionado told me that Curse of Mapuche was one of, if not the, best escape rooms he has done. While I have not done nearly as many rooms as he has, the room did not disappoint!We found it to be a perfect level of difficulty (with a couple of hints) for a 3 generation group of 6. Great mix of combinations and technical puzzles, and some very cool effects."
"Escape room ""Curse of Mapuche"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-curse-of-mapuche,1,This room I would say is rather difficult. It has an Indiana Jones vibe and puzzles that can be solved at the same time. Be sure to do that if you want to escape in time. My entire group loved it!

The location is very easy to find, near by the strip. The staff Sandie, Joe and Peter are very efficient and effective with their dealings and giving us clues. Over all experience is very fun, creative, and challenging."
