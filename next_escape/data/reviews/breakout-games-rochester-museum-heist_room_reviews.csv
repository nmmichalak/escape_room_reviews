Have always been hearing about these but never checked one out until now. The eight of us chose the Museum Heist. Each of us contributed to eventually escaping with 6 minutes to spare.

It took a little while to get the hang of it, but when we did it was so much fun trying to figure the clues out. We can't wait to go back and do the Kidnapping room. Thanks for a fun time Breakout!"
