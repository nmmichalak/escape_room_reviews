We had a great time at the Budapest Express. Really high quality room, great puzzles, then great drinks & eats afterwards. We will be back to try every room here."
"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-budapest-express,1,"My boyfriend and I have done close to 20 escape rooms, primarily in the Denver area. Escapology is the place to go if you’re looking for the whole package: awesome, high-quality games, delicious food and drink, and friendly, knowledgeable staff. We played the Budapest Express, and can’t wait to go back for more. We got there early for drinks and appetizers at the bar. The food came out quickly (try the bacon mac and cheese!) and they had a super cool cocktail menu!"
"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-budapest-express,2,"We were warmly greeted by hosts who led us to our escape room, the ""Budapest Express."" She gave us a briefing of what to expect and wished us luck on our adventure. The details of the room were well thought out and put together. They matched the time period of the adventure with clever touches throughout. Location was off-downtown with plenty of parking options. The indoor ""Steampunk"" decor, food/drink themed-offerings and escape rooms make me want to go back and take friends. Highly recommend."
