"Escape room ""Room 407"" by EXIT Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/exit-tallahassee-room-407,0,"We had a big group for my husband's birthday and the owner went above and beyond to accommodate us! We were able to split the group and one group did Jailbreak and we did Room 407. I won't give away any details, but it was very well conceived. Room 407 was challenging, but very fun! We can't wait to go back!"

We had such a good time that we decided to come back the next day and do the Jailbreak room. Each room had different challenges, and I don't want to give anything away, but we enjoyed both. The room designs were very well done. We could tell that a lot of thought and care had been taken. Also, I was so happy at how kid-friendly both rooms were. My son had a great time and felt very included. Whenever new rooms are built here, we will definitely come back."
