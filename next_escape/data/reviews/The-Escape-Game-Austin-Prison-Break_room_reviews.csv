"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/The-Escape-Game-Austin-Prison-Break,0,"We've done 3 different rooms here. The staff is fun and helpful. This is our favorite escape room- we've done them at 4 other locations. Varying difficulty. Prison Break is super hard, but we escaped the other two we did."

This escape room is located in downtown Austin within walking distance of many hotels. We did the Prison Break game, and I have to say it was very good. Unfortunately, I can't say what I liked most about it, as that would give it away, but it compares as the top 2 of the 10 or so Escape rooms I've done. It's meant for a group of 5-7 people. If you've never done a game like this before, I strongly recommend it: it's a great way to get to know people (like your daughter's new boyfriend, for instance)."
