"Escape room ""Telegraph"" by Alley Escape at Regal Lanes in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/alley-escape-telegraph,0,My group had so much fun doing the escape room! We were also their first group to make it out and all of the staff was so nice congratulating us and whatnot. Very cool that they give you a free game of bowling + shoes after as well. We all had a great night there!
