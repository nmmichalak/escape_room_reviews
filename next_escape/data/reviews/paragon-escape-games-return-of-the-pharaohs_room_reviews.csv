"Escape room ""Return of the Pharaohs"" by Paragon Escape Games in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paragon-escape-games-return-of-the-pharaohs,0,"I've been to several escape rooms now, & this is by far the BEST!  The atmosphere is amazing- it doesn't look ""decorated"" as much as it feels like you get transported into the experience!  Everyone in our group was constantly needed, to help/search/solve the entire time- and the 12 & 14 year old in our group figured out things that the adults couldn't!  This escape room was a BLAST, you don't want to miss it!"
"Escape room ""Return of the Pharaohs"" by Paragon Escape Games in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paragon-escape-games-return-of-the-pharaohs,1,You have not been to an escape room until you’ve tried Return of the Pharaohs! The room is incredible. I felt like I was in an Egyptian tomb. The puzzles all went along with the theme and the attention to detail will blow you away. I can’t wait till their other rooms are finished.
