"Escape room ""Alien Conspiracy"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-wp-alien-conspiracy,0,We loved the fact that they did private bookings so my husband and I had the room to ourselves. It was better than many of the other escape rooms we've done. It was very well put together and the staff was so friendly. Great experience. We will be back for sure!
