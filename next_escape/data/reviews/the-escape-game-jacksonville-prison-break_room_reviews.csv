"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-prison-break,0,I was initially abrasive when it came to escape rooms. The idea of being trapped in a room with friends with only our wits about us to help us escape shook me a bit. But instantly when I walked in I was very warmly greeted by the excellent GES at the counter. I do believe her name was Ashley Stephenson? Anyway she prepared me for some of the most fun Iâ€™ve had in a long time. What an excellent way to spend the afternoon!
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/the-escape-game-jacksonville-prison-break,1,Such a clever and challenging room. There were multiple rooms to get into and it was very nicely staged. We all thought that the prison was one of the best rooms we have done and we have done about 15 rooms throughout Jacksonville! Can't wait to do them all!

General Price: $35/Book online or walk-in Room capacity: 2-8 People Escape Room: Prison Break (Company Level:9/10, my scale 8/10) Probably the best decorated room I've ever been too, mind you, I've done over 15+ games. You literally felt as if you were in a jail cell (no further details to share, :) ) . Creative puzzles that really tested our minds and problem solving abilities. Our ""helper"" was great explaining the process and helping us with clues when the team got stuck. We escaped with three minutes to go and everyone was excited! Glad this came to the Jacksonville Town Center. General notes:- You are allowed 3 free clues, but every one after is a +3 minutes to your overall score. - Use restroom before hand but you can leave by pushing the green ""Exit button"""

The staff was very friendly and considerate and helped us from the time we checked in to the time we checked out. After our first escape game they offered to take our picture and we also were offered a discount for our next game which made us more inclined to come the next morning. If I ever stop by again I'm definitely going to try out their new playground room!!

I was so excited. The room was very well done and I felt like I was in a cell for real. We lucked out and had Justin again though I think I scared him with my screaming  Can't wait to make my friends go back!!!"
