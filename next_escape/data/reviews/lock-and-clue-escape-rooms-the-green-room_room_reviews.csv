Their hints at the beginning really helped and they came in a couple of times to move us along out of an area we were stuck on. Everyone was able to participate and help out in the puzzle, such a great time! The staff was super friendly!"

The staff was friendly and enthusiastic. There were 4 of us and 4 random guests. All 8 of us worked together as a team and had a blast. We escaped the Green Room! Will definitely do it again. Looking forward to the next time already.
