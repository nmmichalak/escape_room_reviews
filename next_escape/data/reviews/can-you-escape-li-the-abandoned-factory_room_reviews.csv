Everybody who greeted us was so friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic that it made us that much more excited for the experience. Our group went through the Abandoned Factory room, which was very challenging and well thought out. Our gamemaster was Jonathan, who was so helpful to us. He really took the time to explain all the instructions and answer any questions that we had. Overall , this was a really great time that we'll never forget. I hope to try another room here soon, and I would definitely recommend this location to anyone interested in trying an escape room."

First time we did The Interrogation room (no longer available) and unfortunately we didn't escape. Second time around (different team) we tried The Apartment and we didn't escape. I was NOT giving up so third time was a charm! Third time (different team) we did the Abandoned Factory and we ESCAPED! Woo hoo! All the staff and game masters are amazing! Quick, easy availability to book online also."
