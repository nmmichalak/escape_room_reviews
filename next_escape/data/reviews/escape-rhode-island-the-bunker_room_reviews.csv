"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-bunker,0,My girlfriend and I were involved in the bunker escape with several friends and it was Epic!!! Would highly recommend this Escape Room but keep in mind you have to work as a team and listen to each other. Good luck!!
"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-bunker,1,"Escape Rhode Island was awesome! We came as a group of 10, many of us who have done multiple escape rooms at different locations. This was our first time here. It was great! We did ""the bunker"" and it was very well designed with a lot of difficult clues and puzzles within it. We thought having 10 people would make it difficult but there were enough clues for different groups to figure out and they could be done at the same time, rather than everyone working on one lock at a time. Highly recommend--Definitely a challenging room! We can't wait to come back!"
"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-bunker,2,"This is the third escape room I've visited and this is by far the best one I've been to. I did the Bunker as part of a group of 8 (you can have up to 10) and this was the perfect challenge for the right amount of people. Without divulging what needed to happen, I can tell you that no one was standing around doing nothing and it required a lot of coordination. What I really liked about this location is that you get 10% off your next booking (great business incentive right?) and if you have to leave to use the restroom there is an exit you can go through and then get back into the game. It was a fun time and I'll come back from MA to check it out again."
