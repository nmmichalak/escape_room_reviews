"Escape room ""Cure of the Alchemist"" by Team vs Time in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/team-vs-time-ct-cure-of-the-alchemist,0,I have played Queen and Alchemist at Team vs Time. The set design is gorgeous. Our game master Michelle was excellent and we were lucky to have her both times. I would say that having more than 4 people in Alchemist would have been too many for the set design/space. I highly recommend this place!

We had our first adventure room experience with Team vs Time with the Cure of the Alchemist. It was such a fun adventure we came back for a second puzzle. The staff was great!
