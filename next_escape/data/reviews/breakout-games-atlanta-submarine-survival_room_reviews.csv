"Escape room ""Submarine Survival"" by Breakout Games - Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/breakout-games-atlanta-submarine-survival,0,"We had a great time as a group, working together to try and solve the clues! While we weren't successful in escaping before the time was up, we still had fun and have continued to talk about the rooms long after our visit was over!"
"Escape room ""Submarine Survival"" by Breakout Games - Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/breakout-games-atlanta-submarine-survival,1,"We went to Breakout Games Buckhead location for our IT Department Team Building activity, and had a great experience, which included a group picture at the end. This type of activity is perfect for individuals who are natural problem solvers/thinkers/inventors/math minded. It provided an excellent way to work on our communication, critical system analysis, problem resolution, and time management strategies/skills and integrate a new member to the team. WIFI and phone access was available. We allowed 2 hours and 30 minutes for activity and lunch. We chose the Submarine Venue and it was a fun challenge with unexpected twists and surprises. Breakout games provided a good description of the venue on their website and thought provoking warm up activities. Directions were easy to follow, and there was ample parking. The facility was clean and neat. We used the large Party room and they had plenty of tables and chairs so that we could have a buffet, put up signage, etc. We could have catered with local vendors at reasonable rates, but chose to use our own catering."

The room was an absolute blast and our Gamemaster Elijah was super helpful and gave us the best experience we could have asked for. 10/10 Would recommend!"
