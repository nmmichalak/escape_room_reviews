"Escape room ""Alien Abduction"" by Escape Room Virginia Peninsula in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/escape-room-virginia-peninsula-alien-abduction,0,"We had a great time as a family (8 of us) and I was very thankful that we could take my 4-year-old granddaughter in the room with us, otherwise, one adult would have had to miss out. The difficulty level was well represented so we made it out as we had hoped. Challenging and fun! Recommend for anyone new to escape rooms. We escaped Alien Abduction, handcuffs and all."
