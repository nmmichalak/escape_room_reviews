"Escape room ""Defused"" by Locked Up - Mishawaka in South Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/south-bend/quests/locked-up-mishawaka-defused,0,"Very disappointed.  I have been here twice in the past- both times were great.   This time, however, everything seemed very run down (in the room ""Defused"".  We were introduced to the room with the information that the first key/lock was broken, then we encountered laminated papers falling apart at the seems, next we tried to work number/letter locks which were so worn that certain numbers were indistinguishable, and finally, a directional lock that was broken- which required the room moderator to come in with bolt cutters. Two stars because the room moderator was great, but I find it ridiculous that as a group of 6 people, we paid over $150 for an hour of fun, and we're not given the luxury of working locks in an escape room. Unacceptable."

I was invited to join my friend and his family. We tried to defuse the bomb. We clipped the wrong wire and ""died"" unfortunately. Would love to try another game soon. This is really good to get your mind going and brainstorm."
