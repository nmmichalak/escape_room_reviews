She was the absolute best out of any escaperoom we have visited. Sweet, friendly and very helpful and patient. We did the Casino Heist, very hard, definitely for the advanced players. Still a good time though."

One of us had never done an escape room before and it was a great room to do with a newbie. This room is slightly different than a traditional room because you work puzzles linearly. However, it was challenging and fun. We enjoyed it and the staff was really great and cheerful."

We have done a few escape rooms prior to visiting Exit Games: Casino Heist, and were blown away by their attention to detail and 'up-scale' feel. The room was perfectly curated and incorporated a wide array of clues and puzzles. It was also shockingly clean, as though we were the first to attempt it. The staff was friendly and attentive, responding to requests for hints instantly, and even going so far as to review the clues after our escape. I would definitely recommend Exit Games for an exciting experience in Wilmington!"
