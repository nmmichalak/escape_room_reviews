"Escape room ""Nuclear Shuttle"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-nuclear-shuttle,1,My husband and I decided on the Nuclear Shuttle room and we had so much fun! Couldn't stop talking about it the rest of the day! This was our first escape room and definitely won't be our last. Our game master was awesome at helping when we needed help but didn't give it away either. We still had to work for it and successfully completed the game with 11 minutes to spare! Thanks again for everything ERHQ!
