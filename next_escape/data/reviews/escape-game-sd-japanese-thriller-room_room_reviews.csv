"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-japanese-thriller-room,0,"A bit of a difficult room, with a strange set of rules designed to make it a bit horror-themed, such as having to run to a central hallway when the lights flash. The room is certainly not scary.There are 3 rooms, each self-contained. This means that you'll know when you have finished a room. There is then a meta-puzzle to escape.The puzzles mostly had sufficient clues to figure out, but our party of 3 had to ask for a few hints to make sure we were doing the right thing. One puzzle took a long time to slog through, which wasn't particularly exciting. All 3 of us were kept busy figuring things out. The room probably wouldn't be good for large groups, even though they accept up to 9.Not a room for beginners."

My husband and I took four kids and fun was had by all. Brandon, our guide was entertaining,  professional,  and appropriately scary to set the mood. The puzzles were challenging. I would love to try another one. Groupon made it affordable. Bravo!"
"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-japanese-thriller-room,3,A good choice for first timers. Ignore the scary background story. Nothing scary in the escape room. We did the room with 8 people that had never done an escape room and finished in 17 minutes - second fastest time for that room. Zach was helpful and efficient.

Didn't expect to have so much fun with a bunch of random people I don't know. The hosts are funny, energetic, and super welcome. They obviously love doing what they do and really into the games. They created some very cool and fun puzzles. I didn't feel like I was just unlocking one lock after another since the puzzles were so diverse. Great job!!! Can't wait for the next room. Highly highly recommend this place."

Staff were super energetic and very helpful. The puzzles were definitely well thought out and very clever!

"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-japanese-thriller-room,9,"Finding the place and parking is part of the puzzle! :PWe did the Japanese Thriller room today with four people. The puzzles were fun and challenging but not too hard that we couldn't solve them after a bit of thinking. We did need one hint though. The company adds some different twists from other traditional escape rooms which we enjoyed. For example, you can earn extra points by finding gems in the room.Overall, we enjoyed the room but did not enjoy trying to find parking to get it."
"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-japanese-thriller-room,10,We had so much fun solving the puzzle and figure our way out. Thanks for all the other yelp reviews that got me into trying this. It was way better and much more fun than i even expected. Our group work so well together and we came out as 4th place. We were so close to being second place overall.
