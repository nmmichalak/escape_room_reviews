It was challenging, but not overly so, and the puzzles were clever. There was a couple times we got stuck, but our guide, Sara, was super helpful with her hints and helping us figure out how to use certain locks. We even managed to break the record, which got us free passes! I've done a lot of escape rooms, and this had all you need for a great room- interesting plot/storyline, unique challenges, and difficult but not impossible puzzles. I highly recommend going here."
"Escape room ""Country Club Heist"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-country-club-heist,2,"This is an example of three groups coming together with very different experience levels and each doing a great job. There are things in the room for people of all skill levels, and enough clues to guide you to completion if there are things you get stuck on. The room is well put together, even though I wasn't too crazy of the theme going in, but I've heard good things about the room from others, and I like their other escape games. Theme:This was good - I was wondering how they'd make this happen and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome.Quality:This was in pretty good order - but you can tell from the pre-game talk that they've prepared for the idea that folks may try and break things.Difficulty:There were some good puzzles here - sadly, there was just a lot going on, a big group, and I didn't catch everything that we did.Fun:So, golf is not really my cup of tea, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did."

We divided up and did two different rooms (Country Club and DOOM). Both rooms were challenging and interesting. We highly recommend both! The employees were fabulous! Such a great outing to do with family."
