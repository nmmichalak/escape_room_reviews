"Escape room ""Humana Festum"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-humana-festum,0,"I did the new Humana Experience two days ago, which includes 4 mini escapes + 2 tacos and 2 cocktails with each ticket (more can be purchased). I've done two other rooms in the past (which are AMAZING), but the new Humana Experience was so much fun...and less stressful due to the drinks and social time. Have a drink, solve a room...eat a taco and have another drink...try another room, etc. etc. etc. Best of all, on Humana night, you can keep trying until you solve! Also, as always the actors are phenomenal! My boyfriend and I beat all the mini-rooms, so in addition to winning little trinkets, you get 20% off your next booking, which has to be purchased on the spot...and we did! I think we'll go for the Elevator Shaft next!You ROCK The Basement, and best of all you're only 7 minutes from my house!"
