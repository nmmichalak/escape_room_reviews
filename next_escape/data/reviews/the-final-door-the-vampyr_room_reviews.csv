Did the Vampyr room and even our youngest daughter loved it! The staff was great and our moderator, Sadie, was excellent with getting everyone in the right mood for our adventure! We will definitely be back!"

The Blackout is the last I have to do until the new zombie one is done and I can't wait to go back!"
