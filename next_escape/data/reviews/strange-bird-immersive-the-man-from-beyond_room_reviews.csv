Love all the actors in this game, really set you into a mood. The whole game feels like a piece of art, from beginning to the end.

"Escape room ""The Man From Beyond"" by Strange Bird Immersive in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/strange-bird-immersive-the-man-from-beyond,5,"I have been in over 10 escape rooms now, and I can say with a certainty, nothing comes even close to this room. This isn't just about escaping the room, it's about following the story, immersing yourself into the theater production that's happening in front of you. This is nothing like any escape room you've done before, I promise. Not to mention that, unlike most of other escape rooms, it doesn't have just a bunch of lock with a linear way of solving the room, it's all custom made, with exceptional visual and sound affects. The puzzles are unique, and the story is incredible. One heads up though, don't bring anyone immature along, and don't go if you're ~14 with a bunch of you 14-year old friend. There's a reason why the age restriction is 16+."
