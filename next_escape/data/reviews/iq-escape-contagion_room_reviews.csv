"Escape room ""Contagion"" by IQ Escape in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/iq-escape-contagion,0,"My husband and I just came from Contagion and it was GREAT! It was just the two of us but we're both pretty experienced with escape rooms. He has a background in medicine which helped us get through the room faster, but it's absolutely not necessary for success as all the information is available in plain language for you. The staff members we met were cool guys and we can't wait to come back for the other rooms."
"Escape room ""Contagion"" by IQ Escape in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/iq-escape-contagion,1,This place is awesome!! It is a fun thing to do and it really makes you use your brain. I have done the Mona Lisa and yesterday we did Contagion. I am looking forward to doing Time Shift next.
