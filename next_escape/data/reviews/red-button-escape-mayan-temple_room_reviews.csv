"Escape room ""Mayan Temple"" by Red Button Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/red-button-escape-mayan-temple,0,Decided to try out an escape room for the first time over the holiday break. We went with the family in a group of 6. We went during the day so it was not very crowded. We tried the Mayan ruins. The puzzles were fun and required lots of teamwork to solve. It had the typical setup where you can ask for answers to the harder clues. There were multiple rooms to unlock and explore so that kept the excitement up. Defintely going back to try out one of the other 3 rooms.

The quality of these surpasses all of the others tenfold. I went with my siblings and my dad. The rooms are set up brilliantly. We did the Mayan one, very Indiana-Jones esque. We were able to escape with about 8 minutes to spare.This was an excellent experience and I can't wait to return to try the rest of their rooms!"
