"Escape room ""The Dwelling"" by Michigan Escape Games in Davison",https://worldofescapes.com/davison/quests/michigan-escape-games-the-dwelling,0,"Having done more than 10 rooms at numerous locations, this one ranks up there with the best. We've done three (CDC, Dwelling, Heist), all have not disappointed. Well built rooms with plenty of unexpected twists. A great time for beginners and experienced minds alike. Personally, I would recommend trying to get enough people to fill a room, just for the best experience and comfort level for all."

I can't wait to come back and try to escape. I've tried The Abduction, CDC, and The Dwelling. I would recommend all three games!"
