She even complimented my moose slippers. So for that she automatically gets a 5 Star savage rating.In all serious, we did the kidnapping game and finished in 48 minutes. The experience was really cool and was fun for our friends.Tiffany helped make the experience and will definitely be back."

"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-the-kidnapping,2,I had the best time at breakout games! I had a group of 6 and we did the kidnapping room. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a different night out or a team building activity. The staff was very friendly and helpful!

My boyfriend and I have tried other escape rooms before but this one by far was our favorite! We went yesterday and played kidnapped with a group of four people and we escaped!! Definitely will be coming back! Also, the staff was just as great!"
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-the-kidnapping,4,"We tried Breakout today and did the Kidnapping game. It was 2 adults, 2- 14 year olds and another gentleman (not with our group) doing the game. The only giveaway I will spill is that...yes, you are blindfolded and handcuffed at the beginning. But honestly, it was not bad at all. It was difficult enough that yes, we needed a few clues to get back on track.  The clues were not answers, but actual clues or steering us back in the right direction if we got way off track (Andrew did a great job as our guide!).For the 2 of us that had done an Escape game before, both said that this was more fun than the others they had done (at other places). We were able to finish with just over 3 minutes left! I would highly recommend Breakout to others and can't wait to go back and try another game!"
