"Escape room ""Mission II"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-2,0,We did the Cairo room and it was so much fun!! If we were in town longer I would totally do the other rooms! Fantastic
"Escape room ""Mission II"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-2,1,This was my second time here - I did Deadwood about a year ago with a group of friends and had been meaning to come back. This time I did Cairo with my family. It was nice that there were many different clues to figure out so that everyone could work on parts and then we put it together as a team. Everyone enjoyed it- it was challenging enough without being overwhelming. Nick was our guide and gave us enough guidance so we didnâ€™t waste our time. Highly recommended activity.
"Escape room ""Mission II"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-2,2,"Our family has done a few different escape rooms in the Seattle area, this  one is definitely one of the best. The lobby is clean and impressive, lots of facilities for guests, including lockers, so you don't have to stash jackets and bags in your escape room. The story lines are fun, and the props and puzzles are in excellent condition. We did the Cairo room, and got done in 40 minutes, using no hints, but some major thinking power. It was just challenging enough, but not so much that we were stressed about it. We are definitely planning to go again and do the other rooms."
