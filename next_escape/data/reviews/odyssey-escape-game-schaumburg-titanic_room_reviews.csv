This place is awesome — we were so impressed. Our host Charles was so accommodating and kind! He gave us a tour of all the rooms and we can not wait to come back! I love the multiple room aspect of the game, this place is by far the best I’ve seen! Highly recommended!"

It wasn't just a bunch of locks and keys, it was more interactive and high tech. I was impressed. I'll be back to tackle the remaining rooms."
