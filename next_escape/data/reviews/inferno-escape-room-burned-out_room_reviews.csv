"Escape room ""Burned Out"" by Inferno Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/inferno-escape-room-burned-out,0,"This is a seriously fun game for corporate groups. Big enough to fit a larger crowed, with plenty of puzzles for everyone to solve. The humor in the room is a great touch. "
"Escape room ""Burned Out"" by Inferno Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/inferno-escape-room-burned-out,1,"*I am an internationally experienced Escape Room enthusiast with hundreds of rooms under my belt*Good staff, good location, original themes. Most, if not all, puzzles are unique in their origin and execution. For first timers or enthusiasts looking for a fun, silly theme, play LIT. For those looking for a small-group challenge, play Inventor's Secret. Larger groups will want to play Burned Out. I particularly enjoyed the mini-escape room that they offered in their lobby. This was only the second instance of that idea that I've found in Arizona and I wish more locations offered it as an intro and lobby time-killer."
"Escape room ""Burned Out"" by Inferno Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/inferno-escape-room-burned-out,2,"I love this place! I came here twice with my parents and friends to play Lit and Burned Out. Everyone in my group really loved it, even my parents who were unsure what it was or if they'd enjoy it. The puzzles make sense, unlike a lot of other rooms I've played. And the themes of the rooms are more unique than anything I've seen and super entertaining and funny! I'm definitely coming back to play Inventors Secret soon. Also shout out to the staff for being the best :)"

Love the theme and the puzzles are original with a touch of humor throughout. I also appreciated the variety of puzzle styles! This room was a good size and can fit a larger group which was nice."
