We went in with a group of 4 to the President's Bunker and escaped with 5 minutes to spare. The puzzles were fun, and weren't overly difficult. That being said, our guide, Marquis, was awesome. He provided us little hints and help to get us passed points we were stuck at. Would definitely come back and try the other rooms again!"
