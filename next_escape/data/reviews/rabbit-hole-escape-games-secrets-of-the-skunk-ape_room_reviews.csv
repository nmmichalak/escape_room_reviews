"Escape room ""Secrets of the Skunk Ape"" by Rabbit Hole Escape Games in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/rabbit-hole-escape-games-secrets-of-the-skunk-ape,0,"This place was AWESOME! My BF and I did both of the Skunk Ape rooms. We ended up playing with only us 2 in both games and were able to get out before the time!! Each game had multiple rooms that were decorated is such detail. I was so excited to go in to each new room. The puzzles and clues all made sense and went with the flow. In some escape rooms we've been in, lock codes and clues were REALLY REACHING, but everything here had some sort of relevance. Even though both were very good, my personal favorite was the first one (named Part 1)! You don't have to play the rooms in order. I think I would have played Part 2 first and then Part 1 if I knew how awesome and harder Part 1 was. SO FUN!"

This is around the 15th escape room that I have been to and BY FAR it is the best!  Four of us did Shadows of the Skunk Ape yesterday afternoon and are going back tonight to do Secrets which is part 2, and their new mini golf!  The special effects in the room were amazing! Like no other I have experienced (felt like we were at disney).  Amy is just fabulous and made us feel special.  I highly recommend this place."
