"Escape room ""Dark Altar"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-DARK-ALTAR,0,"We had a blast at this escape room. My friends and I just recently getting into this and so far this was one of our favorites. We did the Dark Alter and it had some pretty cool passages. I won't give clues to how to solve it, but let's just say you definitely feel like Indiana Jones with this one. A must try!"
"Escape room ""Dark Altar"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-DARK-ALTAR,1,"This is the best escape room I've done. I did Dark Altar with a total of 6 people. I definitely recommend having 6 people, but you need 4 minimum. This room was super high tech and unlike any other escape room I've seen. The clues were all working, they were clever and tough, and the decorations were on point. We escaped in 61 minutes and used 3 clues. You get an unlimited number of clues, but we tried to do as much of the room as we could without hints. They take your photo at the end and airdrop it to you right then and there (again high tech!). Parking was a little weird since it was in a warehouse of a random street."

I don't want to give anything away, but the use of gizmos is top notch. The escape room is also actually multiple rooms which is cool. The only thing I will say is that I think the last puzzle with the rotating numbers is a bit too difficult and not sure anyone would get that without a clue. We had to get clues several times and I doubt anyone has ever done it in time without using clues.My advice: don't waste too much time not getting a clue if you really need one."
