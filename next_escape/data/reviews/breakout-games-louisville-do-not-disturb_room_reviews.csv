We did Do Not Disturb and finished with about 10 minutes left. The only thing negative I’d say is that 8 people is a LOT for the space we were in and a lot to coordinate (I.e, not something for all 8 people to do at once). I’d say 4-5 would be ideal. Our Game Master Hannah was awesome and very helpful. Definitely recommend."

It was a last minute date night idea and they were nice enough to work with us and give us a last minute reservation. We had avoided trying an escape game because we didn't think it would be that fun, now we can't wait to try another scenario room! Our room was ""Do Not Disturb"" and the difficulty was just enough to get your mind working and it was so fun trying to work together to break apart clues. They put a lot of thought and work into their rooms. Joshua was our game master and he was the absolute best! We will definitely be back to Breakout of Louisville next time."
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/breakout-games-louisville-do-not-disturb,4,"We completed the Kidnapping mission with five adults and were joined by two teenagers. My boyfriend and I then returned to do the Do Not Disturb mission with just the two of us. It was definitely the toughest mission we've done, but broke out with 5 minutes to spare. I'm not sure how you would fit a larger group of 8 in there since it was a very small room.PROS: large parking lot, more high-tech components (iPad, lasers, appliances, etc.) than other escape rooms, white board provided to keep track of information, super friendly staff, free stickers!CONS: cramped waiting area for the number of people in attendance, no place to secure personal belongingsAll in all, it's a fun new hobby of ours and we will definitely return to try out all of the other missions!"
