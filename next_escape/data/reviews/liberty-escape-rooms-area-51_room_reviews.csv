"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Liberty Escape Rooms in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/liberty-escape-rooms-area-51,0,"Did the Area 51 room with my husband and we loved it! We have never been to an escape room, and I understand the hype. Even though we failed to solve the puzzle, we are more determined than ever to return to figure out more rooms! The staff was polite and attentive. What a great experience!"
