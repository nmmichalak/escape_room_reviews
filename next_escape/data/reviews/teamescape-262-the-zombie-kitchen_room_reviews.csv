"Escape room ""The Zombie Kitchen"" by TeamEscape 262 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/teamescape-262-the-zombie-kitchen,1,We spent a fun afternoon attempting to escape Zombie Kitchen. We were disappointed that we were unable to make it out in time.. just a few more minutes and we prob would have lol. We did have a lot of fun though. It was harder than I expected it to be and a little creepy but with a name like Zombie Kitchen you know up front that creepy is the theme. My favorite part was afterwards they had great photo props. It is a great team bonding opportunity. We laughed so much!!!
