I've done escape rooms in Los Angeles and Seattle, and had such a good time at Escape Factor. My friend and I took her 12-year-old daughter and did the 30 min room. Not only is the story fun, but there literally is something for everybody. The games within the game are really thoughtful and everybody we interacted with was so helpful. Can't wait to do other rooms that they have!"

Thomas greeted us and he was so professional and welcoming. Very impressed by him and how nice he was. Made us want to go back for that alone. The escape room concept is so clever and I definitely want to go back!

This time we did the 30-minute escape room (having already done the 60-minute one) and it did not disappoint. It was extremely well set up, very clever and fun. Our game master (and one of the owners) Dexter was hilarious and helpful. This place is absolutely one of the best escape rooms we've ever been to - highly highly recommend. Our kids are 10 and 12 and thoroughly enjoyed this as well. Can't wait for the game show room to open!"

The hints were increasing specific, which is great, as you learn how to solve the puzzle, as opposed to wondering why you got stuck."
