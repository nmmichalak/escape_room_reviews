"Escape room ""The Menagerie"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-menagerie,0,"This review is about two weeks overdue. I can't thank the folks at Level Games enough for helping me pull off a fun 300th escape room surprise for my best friend. They were amazing and very accommodating. I had a plan set in motion to help my friend celebrate his 300th Escape Room and they helped me store the cake and balloons in their party room until after we exited the room. They even decorated the room by writing Happy 300th on their wall. For the room itself, we did The Menagerie. When I tell you that we had a blast, it doesn't even begin to describe it. The room was so well designed and there were lots of things to do for the 8 people in the room. I usually don't like larger groups in general for a room but this was a special occasion and it did NOT disappoint for one minute. We were thoroughly entertained throughout its entirety. I can't wait to see what else Level Games has in store because this room was great! Thank you again for the amazing hospitality!"
"Escape room ""The Menagerie"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-menagerie,1,"Played ""The Menagerie"" when it FIRST opened expecting a clunky ""beta"" but were pleasantly surprised at how complete and solid it was. Out the gate, this game was amazing. You can tell these people put their heart and souls into these games because of the attention to detail. My girlfriend is such a scaredy-cat and screamed multiple times at inanimate stationary object, which made it that much more exciting. We also played the Doggy Dog and Disrupted Decades rooms in the past and left with big smiles. All REALLY well done and super fun. Will be back if they release new stuff."
"Escape room ""The Menagerie"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-menagerie,2,"Escaped from the new Menagerie Room at Level Games. It is a great experience developed by the creative minds and hands of the designers and owners of Arcane and Escape Chronicles.  All the puzzles and set pieces demonstrate the skilled craftsmanship of Arcane's wooden and mechanical wonders coupled with the originality and innovative puzzle flow that is a hallmark of Escape Chronicles.  This room was more of a cabinet of curiosities than a menagerie, with beautiful and intricate showcases that are interesting to look at and challenging to fully comprehend. There are some thrilling and unsettling moments provided by good production, sound and light effects, and most importantly a sense of timing and pacing that a certain evil genius would be proud of.  This room is a must-do!"
