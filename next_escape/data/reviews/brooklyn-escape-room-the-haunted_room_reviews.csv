Did the Haunting room and had an issue with lighting at one point but it was sort of our fault. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back."

"Escape room ""The Haunted"" by Brooklyn Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brooklyn-escape-room-the-haunted,4,"This was one of the absolute coolest experiences of my life. I had heard of escape rooms and always been curious, but didn't really think much of it. But my friend and I decided to try something new during my most recent trip to NYC.We were placed in the ""haunted room"" and left to figure out the clues to open doors. (and walls, and fireplaces, and closets) The vibe was amazing. I felt like I was acting in a horror movie, or just plain in a haunted room. Multiple times we found ourselves jumping and screaming at noises or movements. And always laughing right after :)It was the beginner room but it was HARD. We almost didn't make it but luckily we did! I'm sure it would have gone faster with more people but it was great working together just the two of us. We got so excited when we figured things out. The whole thing was just a really amazing thrill - like the best haunted house I could ever imagine.And it's affordable! A really great idea if you're looking to do something fun with friends that doesn't involve a bar.DO IT!"
"Escape room ""The Haunted"" by Brooklyn Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brooklyn-escape-room-the-haunted,5,Loved this room and I really enjoyed the atmosphere the room creates . We felt like characters in a horror movie. It's less puzzle oriented but it definitely requires you to think. Overall a very good experience. We finished with 3 minutes to spare.

Totally surpassed my idea of what an escape room could be. All 3 rooms are so different and have their own specific styles of play.The Haunted is great for beginners, but that's certainly not a dig on the difficulty because this room is tough. Lucky for us, we got 3 clues to use, and our game master was amazing. The price is perfect, and honestly, the experience is worth more than the price tag."
"Escape room ""The Haunted"" by Brooklyn Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brooklyn-escape-room-the-haunted,7,I'm so excited that they are now in Brooklyn! I went with some girlfriends and it was just a really nice way to spend time together. I didn't realize how challenging it would be! I will definitely go back again.

The groupon deal seemed good enough to give this place a try. We all had a lot of fun. Even though we ""lost"", it was clear that the people who created this game are extremely clever and creative. It was an amazing experience, and there were clues that I could never have gotten on my own. I guess I'm no Sherlock :( But I'm looking forward to the next game that they come up with. I definitely would recommend this place."
