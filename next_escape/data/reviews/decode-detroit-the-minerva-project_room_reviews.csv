"Escape room ""The Minerva Project"" by Decode Detroit in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/decode-detroit-the-minerva-project,0,Excellent game with an actor/skit good enough that it was sometimes difficult to tell which components of conversation were real vs game related. Least scary escape room for my child (6yo) so far as well!
"Escape room ""The Minerva Project"" by Decode Detroit in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/decode-detroit-the-minerva-project,1,Great theme and even greater feeling from the moment you walk in the door. Character felt real and the futuristic feel of the whole theme was well worth the drive. Great job and look forward to coming back.

Puzzles were challenging but fair, and I really enjoyed the storyline aspect of it! For reference, my friends and I participated in and completed Part 1 which is the Minerva Project. Highly recommend to anybody interested!"
