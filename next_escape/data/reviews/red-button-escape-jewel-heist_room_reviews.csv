It was our first time doing an escape room and it was phenomenal! From the moment we walked in we were greeted with happy smiling faces, instructions as well as the staff getting us pumped up for our Jewel Heist Room escape.We had 8 people in our group and we failed lol! We were soooooo close though if we would have had 3 additional minutes we would have escaped. We will definitely be back to try the other rooms."
