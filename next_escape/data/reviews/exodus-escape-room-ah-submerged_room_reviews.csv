"Escape room ""SUBmerged"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exodus-escape-room-ah-submerged,0,"My family and I did the ""SUBmerged"" escape room and it was so much fun! Although we faced some challenges along the way, we were able to complete the escape room with some help. I will definitely be back! Alexandra really made it so much more enjoyable. She was attentive and enthusiastic, you can tell she really enjoys her job."
"Escape room ""SUBmerged"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exodus-escape-room-ah-submerged,1,I love this place. We've done all 3 of their rooms and SUBmerged is for sure my favorite! Plenty to do and there's a nice mix of technology and hands on locks. The theme is well thought out and present throughout. Looks great and was fun to play!

We all had never done an escape room before, but we ended up picking the hardest room: SUBmerged. It was really difficult.... but we had a blast! Alex was great and made the whole experience even better. Will be coming back!!"
