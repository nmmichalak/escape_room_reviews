"Escape room ""Interrogation"" by One Way Out Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/one-way-out-jacksonville-interrogation,0,"My first time at an escape room! A group of us from all over the world came, experienced, and conquered the Interrogation room at One Way Out and from start to finish, both the professionalism and hospitality of the staff were outstanding. Homegrown entrepreneurs at their best--just awesome!! I think what made this room really special was the live actress. She was SO good! Since the rooms are all based upon a building story, it really adds to the depth of the experience. We'll definitely be going back for the rest of the story! A night out with friends at its best."

This one was unique in that each room is connected to a larger story. I, along with 6 friends from literally around the world (we were in Jacksonville for a school session) did the Interrogation room. It had a live actor (who was amazing!) and the puzzles did not disappoint. We definitely want to come back next time and start from the beginning of the story!"

It was a great experience and we will be back for sure!"
