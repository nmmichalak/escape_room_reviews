"Escape room ""Mosi's Curse"" by Escape This in Hesperia",https://worldofescapes.com/hesperia/quests/escape-this-mosis-curse,0,"This was a great room.  The puzzles were challenging and fun.  There were also some cool surprises to be found.  My only complaint with the experience was being paired in the room with strangers.  It makes the experience less enjoyable when you are solving puzzles with people you don't know and when their style of working is different than yours.  They had been drinking and were loud and cursing a bit, to each their own,  just not what I enjoy being around. Overall the experience was good, but it would have been so much better had it just been our group alone in there. "
