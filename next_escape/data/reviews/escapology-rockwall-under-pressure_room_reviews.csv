"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Rockwall in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapology-rockwall-under-pressure,2,Arturo was amazing! When we arrived we already had a time slot scheduled. We checked in on the tablets easy. Then we (all 6 of us) ordered beer/wine with an refill half way into the game. We were in the room ‚ÄúUnder Pressure.‚Äù We escaped! Lots of laughs and a great time! Would recommend and definitely will be back!
