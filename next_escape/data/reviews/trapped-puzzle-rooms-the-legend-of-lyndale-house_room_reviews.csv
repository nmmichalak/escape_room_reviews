"Escape room ""The Legend of Lyndale House"" by Trapped Puzzle Rooms in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/trapped-puzzle-rooms-the-legend-of-lyndale-house,0,"Such a great experience!  The Lyndale House has a lot of great puzzles and challenges to tackle, not least of which is communication!  All the floors of the house are utilized, with clues scattered throughout!  I went in with a group of a dozen experienced escape room artists and we needed nearly the full 90 minutes!  Difficulty rating should be at least a 3, if not better!"

Being 90 minutes and having multiple levels of the House makes it a great challenge and team effort. Wonderful mechanics and lots of unique features from other escape rooms weâ€™ve done. I personally am not a fan of the spooky theme, but having others with you makes it a fun experience with a few jumps and screams - but overall, we had a blast!"

I highly recommend both the Very Potter and Lyndale House rooms - but only if you're ready to be ruined for all other rooms. Seriously, these guys are top notch and have been consistently good. We've done rooms all over the US and these are my favorite and most memorable! Thanks for an awesome time and we can't wait to come back and do more!"
