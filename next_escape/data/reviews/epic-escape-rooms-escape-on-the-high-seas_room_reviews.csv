The staff is super friendly and helpful in all aspects of the adventure. We had tons of fun. We tried the Mad Hatter and the High Seas rooms and though we were very close to escaping, we are still trapped. Haha! Thank you for a such a great experience!! I'm sure we will be back soon."

We werenâ€™t disappointed. The pirate theme room was fun, super puzzley but we never got to that frustrated stage because the game masters and hints are just enough to keep you moving forward without spoiling the challenge. I definitely recommend it."
