"Escape room ""Da Vinci"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-leonardo,3,"What a fun way to spend a Saturday! I've heard a lot about escape rooms, but have never experienced one before until a couple of friends found a Groupon and invited us along last weekend. We went on the Indiana Jones-themed Holy Grail room, which was such a blast! I don't want to say much about the room so as to not give anything away, but it's definitely challenging (though not impossible, especially with a couple of clues from the owner who you can reach via a button on the wall). The room was so perfectly decorated and really set the scene; we really felt like we were in a medieval dungeon searching for clues. We had such a fantastic time here, and at the end the owner offered to take a few pictures of our victory. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out if you're looking for something different to do to switch up your weekend!"
