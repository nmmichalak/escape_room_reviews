"Escape room ""The Hangover"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-the-hangover,0,"We booked the hangover as a work group activity. There were parts of the experience that made one ""blush"" at times but that is why there is an age restriction! We worked great as a group and the clues provided really kept us moving. Been to other rooms, but this was my FAVORITE so far. Just booked body collectors to do next!"

The level of detail alone was worth it and it was consistent from start to finish. They took no shortcuts and provided a great experience. Can't recommend enough if you enjoy escape rooms.
