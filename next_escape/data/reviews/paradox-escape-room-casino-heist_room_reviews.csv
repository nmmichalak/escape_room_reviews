"Escape room ""Casino Heist"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-casino-heist,0,"This place is great! The puzzles were challenging, but not frustrating. The staff were super friendly which made it even more fun! We actually didn't finish the casino heist, but there were only two of us and we were so close! The end when we lost was almost the best part because it was so funny! Totally worth the money!"
