"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,0,"We did both rooms at the Quest Room. We were very close to getting out of the harder room (Da Vinci) and got out of the Bloody Elbow room. The theme of the second room was on point. Both rooms were very well done and came with wearable props. Our gamemaster was awesome and enthusiastic. Also loved the tea provided between rooms. Great puzzles, great themes, and private bookings. Would definitely do their next room."
"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,1,"We played Bloody Elbow and could not have had more fun if we tried. The quality of the room was unbelievable, and our game master Daniel was a super fun and helpful host. The room has puzzles that are super inventive and give a real sense of accomplishment when you solve them, making every puzzle you figure out feel like a well deserved victory. Can't wait to come back!"
"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,2,This is a must do escape room!! So unique compared to any other rooms I have done. I’ve been to rooms all over the country and world. Most games will focus on a multitude of locks/keys or numbers. “Bloody Elbow” only requires 1 key and no numbers. This made the game feel way more immersive and intuitive. It felt as if I was escaping like I would in real life. Physical activity required was such a good element! Highly recommend if your in the LA area.
"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,3,"I have done many escape rooms, and this one was by far the best. It wasn't even a contest. For starters, the guy who greeted us at the door was insanely nice, and helped set the mood for ""The Bloody Elbow"". The puzzles were all perfectly on theme and none of them felt ""tacked on"" at all. The set pieces were highly interactive, beautifully done, and larger than most rooms. Everything fit and gave a real sense of progression. I can't give enough praise to this experience. If you are thinking about trying it out, just do it. I give my word that you will have an absolute blast. Looking forward to their new experiences. I plan on trying them all."
"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,4,"Played the ""Bloody Elbow"" room this past week. It was really fun and well themed. The atmosphere was scary, but not terrifying and the props were of really high quality. This was my first time doing an escape room and it was definitely harder than I anticipated! Luckily, we had some tips from a fellow ""prisoner"" to help us through. You won't play with any strangers so make sure you bring a group of 3 to 5 people. I want to go back and try the DaVinci room now!"
