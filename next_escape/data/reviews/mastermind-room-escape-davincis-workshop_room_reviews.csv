"Escape room ""DaVinci’s Workshop"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-davincis-workshop,0,We were in the Da Vinci room and it was very challenging. We had a great time and our host Adam was awesome. We can't wait to come back!
"Escape room ""DaVinci’s Workshop"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-davincis-workshop,1,DaVinci's workshop was so fun! The room itself was smaller than I expected for my first escape challenge but jam packed with puzzles and clues that you actually had to think about to find the answer. It was amazing working through all the pieces and thinking out loud with my team of 8. Could be completed with as few as three but more brainpower = quicker escape for sure!! Can't wait to go back for another challenge!

Was a blast and everyone was talking about it for hours afterwards. Well done and great people working at the facility. Highly recommend the Mastermind Room Escape!

I had a group of 17 for an engagement party. We split into a a Bride and Groom team of 8 and 9 and got to go into identical rooms (DaVinci's Workshop). We both ended up escaping, and the experience was a really fun addition to their engagement party! Definitely recommend!"
