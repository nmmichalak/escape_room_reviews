"Escape room ""Trapped in Time"" by Urban Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/urban-escape-games-inventors-dilemma,2,"This is by far the most well executed escape room facility we’ve ever been to! We’ve been to several around Atlanta and the rooms at Urban Escape have been our favorite. The puzzles are challenging, and are all correctly correlated to the theme of each room. We’ve tried out two of the four rooms and we can’t wait to try the other two! Great job, Urban Escape!"
