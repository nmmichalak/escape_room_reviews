"Escape room ""Bunker"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-the-bunker,0,"I loved it, it was 5 of us, it was supposed to only be me and my boyfriend at first, but I'm glad we went with Friends Because had it of just been me and him I doubt that we would have even be able to make it as far as we did. We had a blast and although my group wasn't able to make it out in time, we still wanna try the other room on our next trip."
"Escape room ""Bunker"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-the-bunker,1,"Went tonight and loved it. I did The Bunker, going back to try Asylum. Great idea. It kept me thinking from the time I started. I'd definitely recommend going with 3 or 4 people. I went with one other person and we ran out of time, but we still had a great time. It's a must try. Also, it was a laid back environment. The person working there was really cool."

Our group beat The Bunker with only 3 seconds left and no hints, definitely love the pressure to make it out and looking forward to trying the other rooms!"

It's a very exciting experience. This validated how well me and my best friends work together. Teamwork is a big deal! It really gets your mind going and once you figure things out, it's such a great feeling. Be able to get out before time runs out and you'll feel like you're on top of the world! Definitely a must do!"
"Escape room ""Bunker"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-the-bunker,5,"This was truly a fun and unique experience. I purchased 4 tickets through Groupon for the Bunker Room. I made a reservation through their website and shortly after I received an email confirmation. We really had no idea what to expect. As you may already know, you get locked in a themed room for an hour and you have to try and escape by overcoming a number of different physical and mental challenges. It's an experience like no other. My entire group had a really great time and we are looking forward to experiencing the Insane Asylum.  They like to have 6 people per session so if your party is less then 6 you may get paired up with people you don't know. They also don't serve food or alcohol so get your drink on before you come."

It really challenges your logic skills and forces you to exercise teamwork - LOVED IT!Parking can get pretty challenging.  Luckily, we reserved a later time slot so parking wasn't bad, but, I would suggest arriving early, to lock up a parking spot.Susie was a great hostess!  My team (Team Adobo) and I only needed ONE hint to escape and Susie was on the other end of the walkie-talkie ready to help us without giving away too much.  Made the experience more satisfying for us to be able to get through it mostly on our own... "
