"Escape room ""Blackbeard's Treasure"" by Denver Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/denver-escapes-blackbeards-treasure,1,"Did the Black Beard's Treasure room. We didn't win but we had a blast. Puzzles were clever and interesting and the attendant was there listening and offering us hints if we were willing to use them.I think I was a bit too stingy on the hints. If I had used them as a part of the puzzle itself and managed them, maybe we would have won? Not sure, but my wife and I had a great time anyways!"
