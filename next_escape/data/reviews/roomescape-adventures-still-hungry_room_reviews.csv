We all drove 1.5-2 hours to get there and we were almost an hour late (due to a very long wait at a restaurant), but they accommodated us! We did the DaVinci's Lost Meatball room and our host was funny and friendly. We had so much fun working together and we won with only 8 minutes to spare!! I definitely recommend to everyone."

This delivered! Action packed, great team work event, and friendship event. I wanted to see which of my friends and loved ones i could trust in a zombie scenario, and they delivered! The puzzles are challenging, and the zombie was terrific! And best yet, we survived so that i could write this review. A+ and will go back to try the second show!"
