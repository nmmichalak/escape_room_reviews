"Escape room ""Psycho Pschool"" by Combo & Key in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/combo-and-key-welcome-to-psycho-pschool,0,"I went with my family to do the Psycho Pschool, and we had a great time. It was definitely tough, especially since 3 out of the 5 of our party had not done an escape room before. But it was great fun! James and his wife were also great. Definitely recommend checking this out!"
