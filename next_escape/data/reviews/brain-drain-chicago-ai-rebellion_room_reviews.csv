"Escape room ""A.I. Rebellion"" by Brain Drain in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/brain-drain-chicago-ai-rebellion,0,"We played AI Rebellion, and we escaped! Great non-traditional type of escape room game, not so many lockers (which require a key to open) like other places, I feel they are higher technology type of escape room.Compared to other places, I do like private rooms, no strangers, less distractions, and you can just focus on the game! I loved the costume provided.We will definitely come back for more games!"
