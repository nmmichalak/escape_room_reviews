"Escape room ""Inventor's Paradox"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-inventors-paradox,0,Been here twice and did both escape rooms we succeed tonight. Was a great time thank you to the staff of the imaginarium. Definitely will be back for the next one.
"Escape room ""Inventor's Paradox"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-inventors-paradox,1," The Escape Room experience at Enter the Imaginarium is simply incredible. I had been to one other escape room at a different company, and Enter the Imaginarium's escape room is a far superior experience, outstripping the other on all accounts.I was impressed, just in terms of scale: while the original escape room I went to was confined to one small room, the ""Inventor's Paradox"" experience at the Imaginarium was huge: just to get to the first room, you must wind your way through a series of corridors that introduce you to the story's themes. After my group solved the climactic puzzle of the first room, we triggered an opening to a second, even larger room with ever more engrossing puzzles.The theming and set design was incredible. While the original escape room I went to was basically a linoleum-floored room scattered with some objects you could pick up, the Imaginarium really went all-out: every inch of the floors and walls were meticulously themed and designed--stepping into the Imaginarium really felt like you were transported to another world (or perhaps better, transported to another character's time and story). From the decor, to the antique and strange objects, to the contraptions, hidden doors, and other puzzle widgets you interact with, to the lighting--the Imaginarium really takes pride in their stagecraft, adding up to an escape room experience that truly deserves the term ""immersive."""
"Escape room ""Inventor's Paradox"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-inventors-paradox,2,"When I entered, I was slightly concerned about the number of boxes with locks on them, but this is truly an immersive Gen 2 room with a great story and great effects. Be warned: there is math involved"
"Escape room ""Inventor's Paradox"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-inventors-paradox,3,"This was the BEST escape room I have been to. The details were beautiful and really made you feel part of a story. We did the Chamber of Illusions first, then came back for the Inventors Paradox. The puzzles were unique and challenging. It was a much more immersive experience than I expected, and our whole group came out raving about how much fun they had."
"Escape room ""Inventor's Paradox"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-inventors-paradox,4,"Our group of seven conquered the Inventor's Paradox today and just barely made it out! It was so fun and immersive, felt like we had fallen into the set of a movie! From start to finish this is an absolutely immersive and fun experience!"
