"Escape room ""Szechuan Secret"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-szechuan-secret,4,We had the best time!!! It was the best family game night you could ask for! It was a challenge and you had to put the clues together but it wasnt anything that was impossible to figure out without some critcal thinking. We had all the whole family from high school grandkids to grandma and grandpa. It was an absolute blast!!!
"Escape room ""Szechuan Secret"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-szechuan-secret,5,"This was the best 60 minutes I've ever spent locked in a room! We were 2 clues away from breaking out! It was well worth the money and the creaters really took effort and creative thought to put this together! Its not like a Haunted house where you expect characters to jump out at u. This has so many unexpected puzzles and clues so your group has to multitask, communicate and think of things from all different angles. I am def going back for the other rooms!!"
"Escape room ""Szechuan Secret"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-szechuan-secret,6,"Breakout Kansas City was such a great experience for my father and I. Although we had the entire room for ourselves and didn't end up finishing the game, it was still such a fun, exhilarating experience. Perfect for families and well worth the money. Staff are helpful, fun, and excited to be there. Once again, this was a wonderful experience - I will definitely be coming back soon."
