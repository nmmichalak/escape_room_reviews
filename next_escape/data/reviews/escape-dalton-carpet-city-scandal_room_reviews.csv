"Escape room ""Carpet City Scandal"" by Escape Dalton in Dalton",https://worldofescapes.com/dalton/quests/escape-dalton-carpet-city-scandal,0,So I've played several games in several states... this was hard! We played Carpet City Scandal and plan to go back for Mad Scientist in the very near future. I'm still sad we didn't escape. Recommend Escape Dalton for family gatherings or friends. Love that they're local.

This was the 24th escape room that I have played and am very impressed. There was so much thought and creativity put into each piece throughout the rooms and the staff are beyond amazing! I would definitely compare quality to one of the better Chattanooga Escape games, so don't waste your gas for the commute!"
