"Escape room ""Electrovault"" by Countdown Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/countdown-louisville-electrovault,0,"I've been to a few different escape rooms around Louisville, and this one immediately stood out. The place is very clean and well-organized, and the staff is super-friendly and helpful.We did Electrovault. It was much more challenging than the simple ""look everywhere and find random keys hidden underneath stuff"" that we've gotten at other escape rooms - this one clearly took some thought and real ingenuity. The staff was incredibly responsive whenever we were using clues.I think a lot more went into these games, their setup, the building and development of the props, etc. than you will see at any other escape room in town. And yet it is also one of the most affordable. If you're into this sort of thing, then this is definitely the place to check out (if you haven't already)!"
"Escape room ""Electrovault"" by Countdown Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/countdown-louisville-electrovault,1,Great place to go with friends on date night! Had a blast! Electrovault puzzles are well thought out and challenging but not impossible! Thanks for a fun time! We will be back to try the other rooms!
"Escape room ""Electrovault"" by Countdown Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/countdown-louisville-electrovault,2,We completed the Electrovault as a fun family outing. It was our first experience. We all had so much fun. Greg was very professional and fun too!! I would highly recommend Countdown Louisville to any group looking for a good time!
"Escape room ""Electrovault"" by Countdown Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/countdown-louisville-electrovault,3,Really a fun time. Our group of four completed the Electrovault with only seconds to spare. Shaun did a great job of explaining everything and setting up the story of our room. The puzzles and clues were reasonably difficult. My tip would be to keep moving along and bounce around from one to the next if you get stuck. And bring more friends!
