"Escape room ""The Runaway Train"" by Quandary Escape Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/quandary-escape-rooms-the-runaway-train,0,We did the train room. The facility and set up is awesome. The staff are one of a kind. Ryan even humored us in all of our craziness. We escaped and we'll be back to try to zombie room!
"Escape room ""The Runaway Train"" by Quandary Escape Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/quandary-escape-rooms-the-runaway-train,1,Both rooms were well thought out and well designed. Never once did we solve a problem and not have the thing open (a problem we've had at other rooms).The train room was particularly well designed with a separation twist at the beginning. I can't wait for the new one.

"Escape room ""The Runaway Train"" by Quandary Escape Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/quandary-escape-rooms-the-runaway-train,3,"We did the Runaway Train room and loved it, even though it was our first puzzle room. It was just the right level of challenging, keeping us on our toes but never giving us a dull moment. The staff was very friendly as well. We'll definitely be coming back to try the other puzzle room soon!"
"Escape room ""The Runaway Train"" by Quandary Escape Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/quandary-escape-rooms-the-runaway-train,4,This was the second escape room I have ever done and we did the train room. It was awesome! First of all when you get there the logo on the door is very cool and code breakerish which sets the tone right away. There lobby is comfortable and clean and the owner was great at explaining everything and moving us right into the room quickly. The train room was very different then the other escape room I did in a great way. There were a lot of multi step puzzles and really creative deliveries and room design that made it a blast. We actually escaped with just under 4 minutes to go too which was really fun! I would highly recommend Quandary to anyone wanting to try an escape room and I will certainly be back to try their locked in dead room. Thanks Quandary!
