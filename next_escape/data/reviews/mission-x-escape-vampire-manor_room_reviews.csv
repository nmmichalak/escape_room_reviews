"Escape room ""Vampire Manor"" by Mission X Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/mission-x-escape-vampire-manor,0,My group did the vampire room. This was the most straightforward (without being easy) escape room I have done yet and I have done a lot in this area.  This room also had some very neat mechanical/electrical puzzles that added to the fun experience.  Stories and decorating were similar caliber to other escape rooms in the area.

Very cool decorations. Neat puzzles with some creative designs. We ended up not finishing, but we still had a blast. I would recommend this as a family or team building experience. Also fun for groups in general. The cool thing to me is that Vampire's Lair is in the dark. You're given flashlights, but you have to cooperate to in order to see what you're doing."

We took on Vampire Manor, and succeeded! The puzzles were so intricate and tricky. I loved it! The staff were also helpful, nice, and knowledgeable. We will most certainly be back to try our hand at another room."
