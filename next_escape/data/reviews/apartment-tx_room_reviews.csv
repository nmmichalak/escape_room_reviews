"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/apartment-tx,0,"We did ""The Apartment,"" and it was very challenging without hints, but in a good way. Lots of fun for the 6 of us. I will definitely be back for another one of their rooms."
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/apartment-tx,1,We had the most fabulous time in The Apartment! Thanks!
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/apartment-tx,2,"Went on a date and really enjoyed it. We went in the ""Apartment"" room. It was an hour or so with 7 or eight other people. Some were family and others couples. It was fun honestly, you get clues and everyone has to work as a team to solve it. I would definitely do it again."
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/apartment-tx,3," We had a blast! I'd love to see an extended version that is maybe 2-3 hours! 60 minutes zooms by!Some of the clues are right in front of your face and others take a lot of thought. It starts off slow. You're not given anything at all. No hints, no starting point. We beat the room with about 2 1/2 minutes to spare!There's nothing scary about the room. I'd say that it would be great for middle school aged kids and up, but they'd need some adult help. The quiz master gives you clues through the TV and a speaker system. There are several clues, several steps to go through. The game moves fast in the last 15 minutes so don't feel discouraged if you feel stuck!I won't say any more for fear of giving something away. Definitely check this place out! I haven't had this much fun in a long time! Best birthday ever!"
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/apartment-tx,4,"I LOVE ESCAPE THE ROOM. I did this once before with a group of friends and we had a BLAST! We did the apartment with a handful of others and got out with 54 seconds to spare - so suspenseful but so, so fun! I then brought this up later to my company that I'm working with for a team bonding event. We rented out all 3 rooms (apartment, 80s, and mission control) and raced to get out! Also an awesome time and great experience! The staff is super helpful and they worked with us to make our experience easy. HIGHLY recommended!"
