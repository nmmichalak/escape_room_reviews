We did the pirate room and the quality of the room was great. My only issue was there didn't seem like much of a rhyme or reason connecting the clues so we felt like the game master had to hold our hand through the room. Even though we escaped, we felt like we didn't deserve it! Anyway, it was a fun time and I would probably go again."

I did Prey first and escaped with a little under 4 minutes. Just recently did Pirates of the Dark Sea and we escaped with less than 1 minute left. Out of all the different escape rooms I've done, Just Escape ranks pretty well among them. They have clean, well designed and high quality rooms. Both rooms I did had great props and challenging puzzles to solve. They were entertaining and managed to not be boring even for someone like me who is experienced with these. They put a lot of effort into their rooms and the themes. I definitely recommend this."

I did the Pirates of the Dark Sea room with four of my family members. There was so much more thinking involved than in their Sweet Revenge but both were a challenge in itself. This was a pretty cool room with how it was set up. Nice little surprises to make it fun. I had Alyssa as my gamemaster and she was awesome. We didn't escape, but we'll be back to try the other four rooms for sure!"
