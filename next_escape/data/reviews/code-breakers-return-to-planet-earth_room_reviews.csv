"Escape room ""Return To Planet Earth"" by Code Breakers in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/code-breakers-return-to-planet-earth,0,"This was my 21st visit to an escape room, and Codebreakers did a decent job with their room ""Return to Planet Earth"". We had to restart an alien spacecraft and get it back to Earth within the hour, completing puzzles and accomplishing tasks that required teamwork and pattern-recognition. The puzzles were challenging, but once we figured out the patterns, it wasn't terribly difficult. We did our job with 10 minutes to spare, requiring one fairly big hint along the way.While there were some great elements to this room, there were a few kinks that need to be worked out. Some of the markings on the props are faded and can lead to some confusion over what they are. Also, they need some hint system. When you ask for a hint, your game-master comes into the room to help, which greatly takes away from the experience. Maybe a walkie-talkie?Overall, this wasn't a bad room. Pros: Puzzles and cost. It's $25 a person which is a fair price. And the puzzles were challenging yet fair. Cons: Hint system and faded props. Simple fixes though, really.You shouldn't need more than a group of 4 for this room, and Codebreakers is opening up a second room in the Spring. I'll be back."
"Escape room ""Return To Planet Earth"" by Code Breakers in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/code-breakers-return-to-planet-earth,1,This was a fantastic experience.  We had been trying to figure out something to do for my sons 16th birthday and decided on Code Breakers.  We were not disappointed.  The boys loved it.  It was something that they had never done before - the puzzles were amazing and the boys were able to Return to Planet Earth.  They worked together and loved every moment.  I would highly recommend Code Breakers to anyone looking for a challenge and anyone who loves puzzles and codes.  They even have a room for younger children ages 7-13.  We can not wait for them to open their next room because we will be back!!!!!!!!

The puzzles were challenging and so much fun! Some members of our group had done several other escape rooms, and this one was our favorite, by far!"
