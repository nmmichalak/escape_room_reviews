My cousin is visiting from Germany and I thought it would be a fun activity. I had no idea really what to expect and we had an absolute ball!!! We even had my 8 year old son along with us and he was able to participate and have just as much fun as the adults. It's well run. The ladies who greeted us today were friendly, and fun. We had a wonderful time and can't wait to do it again!!!"
