"Escape room ""Sherlock's Home"" by Chamber Escapes in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/Chamber-Escapes-Sherlocks-Home,0,Just left the escape room and we had a blast. There were four of us and my niece suggested we try something new. Todd and his sister were amazing - super accommodating and friendly. We finished the last puzzle in a mad rush. Very interesting to see everyone's personality under pressure! I would absolutely recommend this!

A full hour of puzzles to solve and escape!  The owner, Todd, is amazing. His attention to detail in the room and the well thought out puzzles kept our group energized and entertained for the full hour, escaping with only a few seconds remaining."

Went for a date and got paired with strangers, which wasn't awkward at all. The staff is super fun and engaging which made the experience even better. Totally recommend!"
