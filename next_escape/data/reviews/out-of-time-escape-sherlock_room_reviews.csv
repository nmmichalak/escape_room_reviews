"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Out Of Time Escape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/out-of-time-escape-sherlock,2,"Such a fun group outing. I went with a group of friends, but I can see how this would be greatly beneficial for a work or company outing. The rooms are fantastic, and decorated greatly with detail. All of the themes they offer are wonderful too. We tried the Sherlock Holmes theme, which is supposed to be the toughest. I can't wait to go try the other rooms, and take visiting family here. Definitely worth the money and hour of your time for a great experience of teamwork, critical thinking and puzzle solving!"
