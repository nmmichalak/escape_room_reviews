"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-island-escape,0,"Island Escape was my 2nd room from Breakout Games - Jacksonville. I was pleased the first time escaping Haunted Mansion with a party of 8 and I was equally as pleased the 2nd time, escaping the Island with 6 people. Island Escape was definitely more challenging = even more fun! My first team wouldn't have made it through the 2nd room. The puzzles were more challenging, but that made it more satisfying. It also would have been too crowded for 8 people. I'd definitely cap off at 6, or do it again with fewer folks.2 out of 2 for Breakout Games. I'm coming back for Kidnapping or Hostage next time!"
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-island-escape,1,Did as a Bday Party and had a Great time. Had a group of 8 who all were 1st timers. We didn't make it out in time. My suggestion is with your 1st clue ask where should you start at and have Everyone work on that together. We definitely all will be back. If you like games and puzzles this is a must try.

Kassy was an amazing game master and super helpful. Island Escape was an absolute blast. Challenging, fun, and well designed. Will definitely be back to conquer the rest of the rooms!"

Our moderator was helpful and attentive (even when we accidentally broke a prop!), and the room was pretty well fleshed out. This was a serious challenge and we definitely got our hour's worth out of it. Good for groups small and large. Definitely will go back!"
