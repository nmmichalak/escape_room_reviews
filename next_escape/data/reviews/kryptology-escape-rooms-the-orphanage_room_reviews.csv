Our first escape room, so it may have took us a little longer than most but we made it out with 10 minutes to spare. One of our best experiences in Pigeon Forge! We will definitely be back for more!"

We did the orphanage room, which I recommend for beginners! It was challenging, but so much fun. We haven't laughed that hard or got so excited in years! Our guide for the challenge was amazing too. His clues were epic. Highly recommend going! Still amazes me how they created the challenge room but nevertheless, I'm glad they did."

The room was so well thought and the staff was super friendly! We really had to put our minds together! It was our first room escape and we had the orphanage room. We had a large group and had a lot of laughs! I highly recommend this place! I will definitely be visiting again!

As we went in the evening, we had the whole room to ourselves. Took us a bit to get going, but all the clues via tv helped, and we escaped with 6 1/2 minutes to spare. We did The Orphanage. Fun bonding time, and I learned how controlling and inpatient I am. Haha. Sam, the employee was great!"
