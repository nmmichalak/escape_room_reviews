"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by RISE Escape Rooms in Tickfaw",https://worldofescapes.com/tickfaw/quests/rise-escape-rooms-spellbound,0,"Spellbound is the rare game that knocks puzzles, set, and story out of the ballpark, creating a one of a kind experience for experienced escapees. The set, as seen in the photos, is a highly detailed, ominous landscape filled with symbols, bottles, and mysterious tools that will all be used to aid in your escape. The puzzles are quite difficult and satisfying, being a great mixture of pure challenge and immersive interaction, an excellent mix. The storyline is quite engaging and complex, unique in the escape room world, and a refreshing addition after the tireless tropes many experienced players are tired of. Do not play this game if you are not experienced, however, as it is very difficult and will likely not be very fun. For the more experienced players, however, this is one of the best choices in the current market."
