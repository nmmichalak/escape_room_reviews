"Escape room ""The Dynaline Incident"" by Quandary Escape Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/quandary-escape-rooms-the-dynaline-incident,1,I did the Dynaline Incident and it was my first escape room. The room was very well put together with a lot of creative puzzles. We escaped with just a few minutes to spare and all had a blast! Look forward to doing another room at Quandary!

The room is awesome, it immediately makes you start thinking. Time starts and after each puzzle is solved, you will be excited for the next part of the game. I won't provide any more details other than you'll be pleasantly surprised throughout the entire game, and will definitely be challenged and must work as a team! Enjoy. Great room Quandary"
