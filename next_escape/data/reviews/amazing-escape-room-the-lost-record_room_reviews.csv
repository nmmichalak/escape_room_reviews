"Escape room ""The Lost Record"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-lost-record,0,"First, we had to wait to go into the Lost Record because the group before us was late. Then something broke in the room and they had to fix it. I've been to several escape rooms before and I could tell that the room was not working properly. For example, an employee had to just walk in and hand us one of the clues.Overall worst escape room I have ever done. Staff was rude and not very understanding with our critique. I expected more from a place called the AMAZING escape room."

Like that there are themes. Something different and fun to do :) Definitely takes some getting used to how the clues work the first time. Staff was helpful and friendly.

Jordan was our game master & he was great!! I would highly recommend this for anyone. We got stumped a few times, but eventually escaped & just had fun trying to figure it all out!"

My group and I were late arriving, but we still managed to ""escape"" in time. The staff were friendly and helpful. Shoutout to the Game Master, without whose help, I think we would never have gotten out!  Loved it, my group loved it, and I'm looking forward to visiting again!"
