"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,0,"Dynamic Escape Rooms has come up with a great game idea. An escape room with varying degrees of challenges. You can chose medium, hard, or extreme depending on how experienced or brave you are! And apparently even if you chose one style one time, when you come back to do another style, you don't play it the same way, so it's almost like a completely different room. We chose the medium Deja Vu and it was just right for us. You don't have to be a Doctor Who fan to do this room. It just adds to the fun and the geekiness if you are. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this room. The decor is great and It was a very fun experience. Our gamemasters were Ignacio and Adam. Ignacio knew exactly when to give nudges and hints, making him one of the best gamemasters we have ever had. (Thx, Ignacio!) Also, Adam is one of the best front lobby people. He is also available on the website for a chat if you have questions. (Thx, Adam!) If you want to play a private room, you don't need to ""buy out"" the rest of the spots. You only pay $30 extra to make it yours alone! The lobby and restrooms were clean and uncluttered. This room would appeal to all ages, sci-fi fans, Doctor Who fans, puzzle fans, game fans. In other words, if you like escape games, we recommend this business to anybody and everybody, travelers and locals alike!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,1,"This was my first ‘escape room’ experience and the team at Dynamic Escape Rooms have set the bar very high. Initially I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of being locked in a room and forced to escape, but was immediately comforted by the amazing staff that assured me that this wasn’t the typical escape room. I could leave and take a break as needed, the door wasn’t locked, and to think of it as an interactive experience instead. And it was just that. I was amazed at the complexity and range of the puzzles in the room and the imaginative story line that linked the entire experience together. I first played at the medium level of the Time Machine Game, my team and I barely completed it on time, but felt we could definitely complete the hard level now that we were familiar with the layout. We couldn’t have been more wrong. I was amazed at how much more complex and different the puzzles had become with a change in levels, needles to say we did not complete the level on time. I will definitely be back and will be recommending Dynamic Escape Rooms to all of my friends. Great Job Dynamic!!!"

I have been waiting for so long for a great escape room experience. I have been to escape rooms in Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix, none compared to Dynamic. The staff is professional, courteous and helpful. The room can be set at different levels, I can't wait to go back and try a harder level! I definitely recommend checking out Dynamic Escape Rooms to all looking for a fun and immersive challenge! Great job Dynamic Escape Rooms staff and creators can't wait to go back!"
