"Escape room ""I.R.I.S."" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-iris,0,"Stopped in while I was passing through because my four friends wanted to do it. I was kinda eh at first but I'm glad I joined in. We went into the Iris Room and without spoiling too much, it was a time travel room. It was actually quite realistic and the narrator really brought everything together. This ended up being a highlight on our trip. The staff was really helpful, both with helping us choose the room, and also giving us recommendations for other things to do in the area. See you guys at the end of the summer for sure!"

I came here with my co-workers as part of a team building event and we had a blast! I'd love to go back to try out the other rooms. We did the IRIS puzzle and it was definitely challenging yet fun!
