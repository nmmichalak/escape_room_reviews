"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-the-apartment,0,"I was thoroughly disappointed by our group's experience in The Apartment.I had previously been to two different escape room places in the Dallas area. I enjoyed the puzzles, mental challenges and teamwork required to get through the rooms. I left each previous experience on an adrenaline high.The Apartment was a different experience comparatively. Rather than having puzzle clues throughout the room that could be discovered and solved, The ONLY clues in The Apartment were given one by one on a TV screen. Apart from these ""clues"", there were no apparent puzzles to solve. The clues were extremely obvious.The effect of the spoon-feeding of clues was that everyone was bunched together, walking through a linear series of mundane steps. There was no ""ah ha!"" moment, no adrenaline, and no shared excitement.$30/person was way too much to pay for this disappointing experience."

Great staff, with an awesome sense of humor. The apartment room is a fun, rewarding challenge. Our guide was the best at giving hints and pushed us in the right direction without just giving us the answer. Go. Do it. Win or lose."
