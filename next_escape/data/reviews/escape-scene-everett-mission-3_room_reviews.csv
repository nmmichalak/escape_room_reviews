"Escape room ""Mission III"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-3,0,"Great escape room venue! We had four people in the Munich room, two of which had never done an escape room before. Marques was helpful in his clues but didn't give any of the puzzles or answers away. We escaped on the dot with zero seconds to spare."
"Escape room ""Mission III"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-3,1,Had a great time as a group of 4 in Munich. We all agreed it's one of the best escape rooms we've done. Completed it just in the nick of time with a little help from Marques. Thanks for a great experience.
