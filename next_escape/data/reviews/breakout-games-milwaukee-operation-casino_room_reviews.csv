"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-operation-casino,0,"We did this with a group of 7 coworkers as a team event. We did the casino room. The room was small but big enough for us all. There were enough clues to keep us busy, sometimes as a group as a whole and sometimes as smaller groups. Everyone was able to contribute. The team wanted to do the game without hints but about half way in we got to a point where we needed a little help. Our game master Alyssa was helpful without giving things away and only hinted when asked. Clues were challenging and creative. We completed with minutes to spare. Overall a very well done escape room."

Well designed room, not very big (our group of 4 was just right, 6 would have been the max IMO), lots of puzzles, simultaneous things going on to keep everyone busy. Lots of puzzle variety, good props (one timed lock did freeze up, staff had to reset it, but otherwise no issues). Good clues from the staff when needed. Highly recommend."
