"Escape room ""Disco Fever!"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-disco-fever,0,"This is an AWESOME way to spend an evening!  Played the time travel room first and had so much fun with Braden as our game master that we came back the next night to play the boogie room!  This as with any escape room, some things in the room didn't always work as planned and Braden did such a good job making sure it didn't trip us up.  Plus, when we got stuck and asked for one of our 3 ""free"" clues, he was great at giving us just the right push to get past what was blocking us.  Disco was super challenging, with clues that weren't logical to find, we definitely needed all 3 freebies plus our extra 10 minutes & clues.  But loved the multi-room adventure!"
