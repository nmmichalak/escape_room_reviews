"Escape room ""The Mojo Room"" by Amazing Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-mojo-room,0,"Took my best friend for her birthday this past weekend and had a blast. We had never done an escape room before and the Mojo room was a perfect level of difficulty. Made it out with 12 minutes to spare! We were placed with two other couples who we didn't know but that was part of what made it fun. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it's a bit expensive, but if you can get a groupon or have some expendable cash I'd highly recommend!"

So though we were unable to actually get out of the room I had a great time with my gal pals.I can't fully explain my grievances because I would give away secrets of the room, but I will say the 2nd to last clue in the 1970's room is absolute bullsh!t.Once the staff went over it I was really annoyed. I felt like it didn't match the theme and didn't actually make much sense.Aside from this we did have a good time and I would consider going again for another room!"
"Escape room ""The Mojo Room"" by Amazing Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-mojo-room,2,My family and I just finished the MOJO room here. We didn't escape but got very close!!!! We had a blast!!!! Everyone should do one!!!! The staff @ 15th Street were sooooo funny and cool. I would do the other two rooms if I wasn't just visiting.Go and have fun!!!!

We browsed through LivingSocial and came across this sweet deal. They honor the deal on weekends (some others did not) and also managed to get us squeezed in between bookings (it was full) for the mojo room (70s themed) right at that moment. Fate!!! The staff was super friendly and very fun. The puzzles were very challenging, yet oh, so fun. Although we didn't escape the room (we had one puzzle left), we did have a blast!! If I'm ever in the city again, I will be returning to try out the other two rooms they have available."
