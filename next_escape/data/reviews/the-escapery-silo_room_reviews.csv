"Escape room ""Silo"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-silo,0,We chose the Silo room and it was great. This was my first time and I will definitely be back to try the other rooms. It was very challenging and the hour just flew by. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to try something a bit different.

The room was difficult and a very fun challenge. Jacob was a great host and was happy to help when we needed it. He also stayed in character which is a huge plus. We all had a great time and we escaped!"
