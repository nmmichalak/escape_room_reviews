We did The Heist and it was a real challenge (in a good way!). We did escape, however! Definitely want to try the other rooms in the near future!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Great Lakes Escape Game in Flint",https://worldofescapes.com/flint/quests/great-lakes-escape-game-the-heist,1,Me and my husband played The Heist and we had a blast! I cannot wait to go back. The staff was so nice and very helpful. I highly recommend playing. We are already thinking of people to bring with us to solve the rooms. Thank you to the staff for a really fun time!
