My husband, daughter, her fianc√© and I booked the Mystery Mansion Room and although we did not make it out we were very close. Drew was our host, he was friendly and a lot of fun. We will definitely be back again!"
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-mystery-mansion,3,Eight of our group of friends did the Mansion game. Allison was our host and did a great job. It was super challenging but we had a great time! The location is convenient with an immense parking lot. The lobby was very basic but had seating and a coat rack. The staff was professional and friendly.Would go back and plan to try to get my teen to do it. I think they would get more business if they lowered the price a little.
