"Escape room ""STAR WARS™: Secrets of the Empire VR"" by The Void Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-void-orlando-star-wars-secrets-of-the-empire,1,"I went there on January 17 th at 12:30 pm 2019,  it was $105.00 for three people,  we did the Star Wars experience,  worth every penny!!!!!  Unreal it was amazing I'm going to do wreck it Ralph next.  I love it,  staff was fantastic, great location, any issues you just stop raise your hand they come in right away to help with anything. I was worried I would fall but you really can't fall,  you can touch walls sit down it's awesome, I went with my brother and sister.  Pictures I bought were $15 for a digital and a hard photo.  Highly recommend,  wish it was longer.  I'd live in it if I could.  Don't hesitate see it,  I get dizzy easy and this did not bother me I have high blood pressure also but no issues.  AAA+++++++**"

We did the Star Wars Secrets of the Empire both times and it is just incredible.  Truly an awesome experience.  Yes, it's 15 min... yes it's nearly $40.  But it's amazing, and those aren't drawbacks to doing it.Highly recommend if you are at Disney Springs, and you like Star Wars, then you should do this!"
