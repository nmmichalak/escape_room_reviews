"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by 5 Wits in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/5-wits-buffalo-deep-space,0,We have been here twice in one week because we had so much fun. We did Deep Space and Drago’s Castle the first time. We did the Tomb the second time. My favorites were the Tomb and Drago’s castle. Fellow claustrophobics - don’t panic...there are emergency exits in each room.

It's fun for people of all ages. I can see how you can get addicted to it by wanting to go back and improve your score which I'm sure we will go back. The staff was extremely nice and helpful with answering any questions"

Did the Deep Space room and it was so much fun. Everything was super interactive. Great opportunity for teamwork. The workers were also all super awesome and got really into the story. You could tell they wanted to be there.
