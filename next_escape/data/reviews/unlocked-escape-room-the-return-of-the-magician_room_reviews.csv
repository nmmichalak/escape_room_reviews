"Escape room ""The Return of the Magician"" by UNLOCKED: Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/unlocked-escape-room-the-return-of-the-magician,0,"I've done quite a few escape rooms in the past (around 15), but UNLOCKED still manages to impress me with unique puzzles I haven't seen before. Some mechanics/tech of the rooms were pretty awesome, too. The rest of my group were first timers but they all thoroughly had a super fun time figuring out the puzzles. 60 minutes went by so quickly!"
"Escape room ""The Return of the Magician"" by UNLOCKED: Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/unlocked-escape-room-the-return-of-the-magician,1,The puzzles were varied in type and difficulty. Nothing felt unfair. You can tell a lot of thought went into the room. The staff is super friendly and the room is good for all ages. I would recommend it to anyone!
