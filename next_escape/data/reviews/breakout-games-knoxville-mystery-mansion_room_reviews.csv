We did the mansion with 4 adults and 3 teens. We almost got out, but needed another 5 minutes. The host did a great job giving us subtle hints when we were spending too much time in the weeds. Very well done, lots of fun and we all plan to do it again!"

It was a blast. We did Mystery Mansion and it was very challenging. Our Game Master, Lilly, was super helpful and did well guiding us. We didn't break out, but we will be back for more!"

We didn't make it, but not for the lack of poor Lilly trying to help. We will be back!"

We had so much fun. I have done one of the rooms before but she had not. Every time I go, the employees are so nice and want you to have a good time. We even broke out! Plan on coming back next week."
