"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/breakout-games-tallahassee-hostage,3,We went with a group of six to do the Hostage room. It was the second escape room for half of us and it was great. Definitely escape-able but not so easy we were ever bored. I highly recommend it for a first time experience.
