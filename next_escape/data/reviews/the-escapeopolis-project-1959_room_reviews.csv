"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,0,"Best price point for a ninety minute game anywhere!  $29 bucks!? Comeon, I pay that much and more for shorter sixty minute games.Overall I give it five stars across the board, quality of puzzles, difficulty level, theming, quality of the props and decorations.  And the briefing they give is spot on, the lore of their backstory is so cool, mostly because it has a lot to do with actual history.  Of course I love time travel to start with, but Escapeopolis actually pulls it off and makes it seem authentic."
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,1,"GO. TO. THIS. PLACE!  Hardest puzzles our group have ever been challenged with, yet excitingly delicious at the same time.  Great theming, great mom and pop owners, and absolutely the best customer service we have ever received  at any of the 100 or so games we have played.  We played both of their games - wildly different from one another - yet incredibly well imagineered.  GREAT!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,2,"Wow!!! This is a hidden, and soon to be a not so hidden treasure in NWA!!  My husband and I and another couple tried out Escapeopolis and Basinga! we found our new favorite escape room game!!First, the puzzles are phenomenal, all very crafty and unique - especially compared to other escape rooms that seem to depend on way too many padlocks.  My hubby loved it!!!  You really gotta think, you know, use the old brain pan to figure these puzzles out.And the look and feel of this place is awesome!  From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were thrown back in time to some military laboratory where top secret stuff went on.  The look and feel continued from the front door into the game and all the way out the door!!  Very nice.We played their newest escape room, the insurgent attack, where we were sent on a mission as security agents to 1969 to... oops no spoilers here folks - lol!We didn't win initially, but we played again later in the day when they had another time for us to book and killed it.Don't forget to book early for this one, they were pretty busy when we went.  We loved it and are for sure going back to play their other games.  You don't want to miss this one!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,3,"My boyfriend and I played this game a couple of weeks ago with my sister and her husband. It was their first game ever, and I’m afraid we completely spoiled them! This game was by far the best game we ever played! The level of immersion from the time we walked in to the time we escaped the room was the best we’d ever seen! Plus, the way the puzzles were set up made sense, like we were in a real place and not a game! The owners were super nice and made sure we had a great time too!We’ll definitely be back and you should come too!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,4,"Best room ever!Not only were the puzzles and the story so much better than the other escapes in NWA, but the price was so much better than everyone else too!Escapeopolis Project, please make some rooms soon so we can come back and play again!!!!!! "
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,5,"So, when I tried to find the insurgent attack game here, I couldn’t. So here’s my review for that room as well.The insurgent attack was nothing like the 1959 game, but boy, was it cool! The story is kicked up a notch and the special effects are super cool too! The game is also 90 minutes, unlike the 60 minute 1959 room. The puzzle were harder than the 1959 room, but they’re still solveable, thanks to the extra 30 minutes. My friends and I didn’t escape, but we’ll definitely be back next weekend to beat this game too! We found our newest favorite escape room today!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,6,"We played the 1959 room and it was like nothing my friends or I had ever played! The story of the game was not only in the game, but also through the rest of the building as well!Once we were in the game, we had to change our normal strategy since there was only one padlock in the entire room! Crazy, I know!We escaped with just seconds left on the clock, but, boy, was it ever so exciting!Definitely give this room a try! My friends and I had such a good time, that we immediately booked the newest room, the insurgent attack, for after lunch!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,7,Unfortunately this was the absolute worst escape room I have ever done. Which is unfortunate because the couple that run it obviously put a lot of time into it. My wife and I have done 20+ escape rooms in several different states across the country and this one was BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE and BY FAR THE WORST! We brought 2 friends that had never done an escape room and I am so sorry that was their first experience. We paid $140 to do their newest room having something to do with time travel. Sadly after having spent over 2 and a half hours there total I still can't even properly explain the room. He talked FOREVER before we even were allowed in. Even though I had asked repeatedly to go to the bathroom. Then serval of there props didn't work. The flashlight we needed to get into the second room wouldn't turn on. The intro video was excessively long. They entire thing was WAY TO COMPLICATED! The clues he gives you aren't even real clues and they were off center so we couldn't even see all of it on the screen. I was so upset with how ridiculous everything was that we told him we were done even before our time ran out. We just wanted to go home. He offered to let us come back for free to do this room again since so much of equipment didnt work correctly but he should have offered us half our money back. I will NEVER go back and I will be sure that none of my friends go either. If you want a fantastic escape room experience go to Bolt NWA! The only reason we tried escapeopolis is because we had done all the other escape rooms in NWA.

"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,9,"I've never been to an escape room experience before, but I really enjoyed it. The back story was really interesting and the room was very detailed. I went with a group of 10 which is probably too many (a little chaotic), but 3 to 5 I think would be perfect. Really nice people too! Highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,10,"I didn't know what to expect at all before entering Escapeopolis, and wow it was spectacular! You can see the hard work that the owners put into making you feel like you're in 1959! I would highly recommend going because you're not going to get this kind of experience anywhere else!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,11,"What impressed me the most was the attention to detail at Escapeopolis. Not only did the rooms have very creative and intricate puzzles, but even the lobby matched the aesthetic of the adventure at hand. Additionally, the rules, instead of being blandly stated, were presented in the context of the backstory. These smaller, more subtle details really helped create an enjoyable experience."
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,12,"This escape room was unlike any other escape room I have ever done. At a normal escape room you are greeted at the door and led to the room where you solve various puzzles to escape. Escapeopolis is much different than a normal escape room. From the moment you are greeted at the door you feel like you are already immersed in an elaborate storyline. You are led to a room full of intricate details and thought provoking challenges, which truly test your puzzle solving capabilities. I encourage anyone who wants an enjoyable mental challenge to visit escapeopolis!"
