"Escape room ""Trapped in a Horror Movie"" by GTFO Escape Room in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/gtfo-escape-room-trapped-in-a-horror-movie,4,"Had a fantastic time here. The support team was excellent and very accommodating for us. Rooms are well designed with good quality props and relevant clues/challenges to be solved which match the theme of the room. Both rooms are challenging but easy enough to solve in the given time (without hints!) if players work well together. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the unique element of Trapped which provides ""limited"" lighting and is one of my all time favorites of any room i have visited so far."
