"Escape room ""Treasure Hunt"" by Mission Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/mission-escapes-treasure-hunt,0,We had an amazing time! My husband and I have done a handful of escape rooms and loved how immersive and clue-/puzzle-based the Treasure Hunt room was. We're looking forward to going back and doing the lunar room soon. Thank you for such an exciting 60 minutes (57 to be exact ;) )
"Escape room ""Treasure Hunt"" by Mission Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/mission-escapes-treasure-hunt,1,This was our families first experience at an escape room. There were four of us ranging from age 20 to 49. We went on Christmas eve and had an amazing time solving the Treasure room. Our excitement grew with each puzzle we solved. It was so much fun! We enjoyed working as a family and each of us had skills that helped solve puzzles with only one hint and 13 minutes to spare! We can't wait to go back and try the Lunar Escape room.
