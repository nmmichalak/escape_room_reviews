"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Lock N' Key Escape Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/lock-n-key-escape-room-bank-heist,0,Went with coworkers for a fun night out. The staff was friendly and professional. We got to hang out in the lounge area and have some food and drinks we brought in before and afterwords. The bank heist room was challenging and rewarding when we finished! We will definitely be going back soon!
