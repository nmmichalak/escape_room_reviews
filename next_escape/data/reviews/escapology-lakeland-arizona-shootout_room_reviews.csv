"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology Lakeland in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/escapology-lakeland-arizona-shootout,1,Tonight was our second time visiting this escape room place and we will be back again. They are always so welcoming. This time our game host was Jordan and she was the best we have ever had. We have been to many escapology locations and she was by far the best front desk staff and game host. She was just excited as we were and understood our skill level. All of the rooms were decorated in depth as well as the lobby to create the full experience. If you are in Lakeland we highly recommend you visit here for a good time.
