Amazing puzzles, kids we're excited to solve them for the whole hour. Adults help was necessary. We all had a blast, working as a team."
"Escape room ""The Anomaly"" by The Other Tales - Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-other-tales-the-anomaly,2,"We took a group of 10-12 year olds to this Escape Room. Most of them had been to other Escape Rooms before and knew the drill. They all loved it - the story, the puzzles, the ambiance. Highly recommend."
