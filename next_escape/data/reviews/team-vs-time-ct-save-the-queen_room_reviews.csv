The time and effort they put into making the sets and making sure it is an enjoyable experience is above all others. I cannot wait to come back and finish the others! 10/10 would recommend.

The attention to detail is unparalleled, there's a HUGE variety of puzzle types which makes it so much fun and the staff are far and way the most wonderful and friendly people I've ever met. Save the Queen was awesome and I'm dying to come back and visit so I can try out Gangsters Gamble!"

I will say though that I was impressed by the room we did. I felt immersed in the game and the theme. We did ""Save the Queen"" which is the hardest one.  We escaped with 17 seconds to spare.The staff was great.  I look forward to returning in the future."
