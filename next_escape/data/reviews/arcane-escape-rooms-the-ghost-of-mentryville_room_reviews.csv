"Escape room ""The Ghost of Mentryville"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-ghost-of-mentryville,0,"We had a double date here last week and we had a great time! 5 stars from start to finish.  We got a little lost (note 405B is NOT next to 405A). We called and the front desk girl ran out and flagged us down.  My husband and I had done escape rooms before, but our friends had not. The girl who checked us in was very clear with her instructions and answered all questions.  She definitely made them feel more comfortable with the game.  I know it can be intimidating for people who don't know what to expect! We did the Mentryville escape room.  It was SO much fun, and I was really proud of our completion. First of all, thank goodness 4 people are the max. I have been to an escape room around the same size where they stuffed 8 people in and I honestly thought I would pass out. The puzzles were ingenious! And I have to say the ghost (Tony/Samuel) was excellent.  We would highly recommend this escape room and we look forward to doing another one sometime soon."
"Escape room ""The Ghost of Mentryville"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-ghost-of-mentryville,1,"We loved the Ghost of Mentryville. It was part escape room and part interactive theater. Our ""live"" host helped guide us through the adventure. In some rooms, the live actor either jump scares you or gives you hints. The actor in this room really is part of the room and sets the eerie, but not scary mood.  The puzzles and tasks in this room are clever and some of the best integrated I have seen and experienced in any room. The set pieces and narration transport you to places well beyond the confines of the room itself and your imagination fleshes out even more details.  There is no strict time limit for this room and the guidance is generous. There is an urgency to complete this room because of the need to resolve situations and close the loop. Good things come in small escape rooms."

Just finished The Ghost of Mentryville & it was incredible! Ghost story telling at its best, brilliant use of a prop! Clever, creepy and very original. Enjoyed the immersive element & not feeling the urgency to rush through it, but still enjoyed the excitement of progressing through the story. We loved everything about this experience!"
