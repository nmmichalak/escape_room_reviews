"Escape room ""Time-Traveling Jen"" by Human vs Room in Bethlehem",https://worldofescapes.com/bethlehem/quests/human-vs-room-time-traveling-jen,0,We just did our first escape room and it was such a good time! The people there are friendly and seem to have as much excitement about you doing the room as you do. We had a group of 7 and did the Jen time traveler room. Everyone was busy figuring out clues and nobody was left standing around without working on a problem. You can ask for clues or try to solve the puzzles on your own. We will definitely be back to try out the other rooms!

The time travel room was awesome and the staff absolutely made sure we had a great time. Thank you for making our friend's bachelorette day special! I'll definitely be back.
