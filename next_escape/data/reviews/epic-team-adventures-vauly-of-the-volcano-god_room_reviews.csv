"Escape room ""Quest for Excalibur"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-vauly-of-the-volcano-god,2,"Went as a couple of experienced players to complete Excalibur room. This room had good tech aspects to it and tons of fun puzzles. Unfortunately, we definitely needed more than two people to finish this one, so we didn't escape. Hosts were always on time meeting us in the lobby and helpful inside the rooms as well. They have a nice green screen photo op at the end of each experience, which is a nice touch. Highly recommend trying a couple of their rooms out."
