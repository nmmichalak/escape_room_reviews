"Escape room ""Dead Zone"" by Trapped Escape Game in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/trapped-escape-game-nashville-dead-zone,1,"We had a group of 4 and decided to try the newest room “Dead Zone”. We had an absolute blast! It was a total rush of adrenaline the entire 60 minutes. The clues were extremely well thought out and very clever. Kudos to the designer!We barley escaped and can not wait to come back! 10/10 would recommend. We’ve been to other well known escape games and we were all in agreement that Trapped has been our favorite! Considering the staff, design, decor, clues, and difficulty...not sure this place can be topped!"
