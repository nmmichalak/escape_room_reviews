I’d pay double to do it again and again and AGAIN!!! It is beyond completely worth the price because of the thrill alone! You will NOT regret it! You’ll want to do them all!!

As always the staff is super friendly. The game master was non-intrusive but attentive and helpful when needed. Breakout's rooms are always fun and they seem happy to keep things as serious or light as an individual group wants. Runaway Train is a physically small room so 6 or 7 people is plenty. The decor is well suited for the room, and there are some cool puzzles to be had. This room is a little bit math heavy. Breakout remains the best escape experience in Birmingham!"
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Birmingham in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/breakout-games-birmingham-runaway-train,4,Our group did the Runaway Train escape room and it was by far the most exciting escape experience I have ever had. The room had a lot of super unique puzzles and challenges that I haven't seen before in any other room. Our game master Christian was extremely helpful and made the game go very smoothly the whole time! I would one hundred and ten percent recommend checking this out.
