Angie was so helpful with hints but not giving it all away. Our family of 5 all enjoyed themselves which is difficult with a 6, 9, and 13."

The design was beautiful, and all of the clues flowed together so nicely. It was definitely a challenging room, but with all participants having previous escape room experience, we managed to get out with 15 minutes to spare! Highly recommended, and cannot wait to try more rooms!"
