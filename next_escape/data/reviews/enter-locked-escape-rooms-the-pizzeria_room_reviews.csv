"Escape room ""The Pizzeria"" by Enter Locked Escape Rooms in Jackson (MS)",https://worldofescapes.com/jackson-ms/quests/enter-locked-escape-rooms-the-pizzeria,0,"The room had a great set up, with lots of puzzles to occupy our team of 6. Very cute theme and decorations, felt just like a pizza restaurant! We had a blast! Enter/Locked never disappoints, definitely the best escape room company in town, hands down."

Even with the help, you feel accomplished when its over. The room was authentic and interesting. Cleverly set up. We solved the Pizzeria. We will revisit soon to try to solve the Temple room."
"Escape room ""The Pizzeria"" by Enter Locked Escape Rooms in Jackson (MS)",https://worldofescapes.com/jackson-ms/quests/enter-locked-escape-rooms-the-pizzeria,2,My friends and I have done every escape room they have here and they’re all so great! Beautiful decorations and great multi-part clues. It’s hard enough to keep you on your toes but not hard enough to make it impossible to solve. We did the Pizzeria today and can’t wait for when the Cleaners opens!

Grab a few friends and check out Enter/Locked! You'll have a blast!"
