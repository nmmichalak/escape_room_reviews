"Escape room ""Rocket Science"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-rocket-science,0,"My boyfriend and I visited the Cape Canaveral area back in March and saw a flyer for Escape Cocoa Beach when we checked into our hotel, so we decided to give it a try. One of the owners was working that night (Vhilena) and she was so incredibly sweet. We did the ""Rocket Science"" escape room and it was NOT easy, but we still had a lot of fun. The location is also great and very convenient if you want to visit the Cocoa Beach Pier before or after (it's only about a 5min walk). A great idea for a fun date night or an evening out with friends."

Both were well thought out, had easy to follow instructions and Jo was a great help when needed! Highly recommend going here!"

Literally. Loved these rooms! The Rocket Science room was a nice introduction into what you're doing and the Black Dahlia was a super fun challenge! We made it out with a minute to spare! I highly recommend!
