"Escape room ""Crazy Professor"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-professor,0,"Yet again I am back at another Lockdown room location!! My friends and I did an escape room spree and we ended up playing Crazy Professor and Hostage Rescue at Highland, as well as Pharaoh's Curse and Cursed Cabin at Sahara. Must I say that I love Lockdown's rooms and employees! You can tell that they truly care about their craft and their customers. We got out of 3/4 of the rooms and let me tell you, even if we didn't make it out of Cursed Cabin, the experience was still amazing!! My friends and I have gotten closer as we bonded through working out each puzzle. Yes we will definitely be coming back!! Also I would love to give a shoutout to the amazing staff that worked at the locations; thank you so much Sierra and Chris!!"

There were four of us and a baby. We had a blast!We chose the hardest one, The Crazy Professor, and were successful at completing it. Though we almost ran out of time.Such an adrenaline rush trying to beat the timer and solve the puzzles.If you are up for a challenge and something different, I'd highly suggest going here!"

It was challenging, but not frustrating, and the Hostage Situation was just enough for two players. So much fun!"
"Escape room ""Crazy Professor"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-professor,3,"Went here as part of a group of eight people on a Friday afternoon. I waited to book until the last minute, so the only room available when we were available was the Crazy Professor room. The website claimed that it was the most difficult, and this was the first room escape any of us had done, so we didn't entirely expect to make it out in time.We took a couple cabs over from the Strip - easy enough to find. It's pretty tucked away in a parking lot, so definitely take a look at the street view photos and/or use GPS. Staff member was very friendly and the place itself was quite well kept. No spoilers here on what was inside the room or how to get through, but the Crazy Professor room definitely takes some smarts and teamwork. We made it out, but only with a couple minutes to spare. With eight people tearing apart the room, we confused ourselves a few times by accidentally stumbling upon clues that were a few steps ahead. I would definitely go back to try the other rooms and highly recommend Lockdown!"
"Escape room ""Crazy Professor"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-professor,4,Definitely the best Escape Room activity that I have been to in Las Vegas and one of the best I've been to overall!We did the Crazy Professor and actually managed to get out. It was difficult but we all really enjoyed the levels and the layers to the clues. Definitely helped having a HS Chemistry teacher in our group (but don't get discouraged!).Customer Service (forgot the gentleman's name) was great and very accommodating. Will definitely come back again!

"Escape room ""Crazy Professor"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-professor,6,"Out of the many puzzle rooms we've done, this location's room The Crazy Professor has been the only room we've ever seen to incorporate a physically demanding challenge in with their otherwise cerebral puzzles. Aside from that, the location offered a fairly classic escape room experience with scavenging, pattern matching, and problem solving."
