"Escape room ""Storyteller's Secret"" by Boxaroo in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/boxaroo-storytellers-secret,0,"World class escape room hiding right here in the city. You can't wrong with any of their current rooms.  Magician's Study is a great escape room, with an actual vault the theme is spot on! However the absolute best one is Storytellers Secret, what an amazing work of art. Everything is absolutely beautifully done. Once you've done this one like this you will will understand the true passion And appreciation for escape rooms."

The production value was great, and the challenge was very balanced. Nothing felt cheap or rushed in there. There are definitely very challenging parts but nothing that makes you say “Come on....really?” at the end. Definitely check this one out."
