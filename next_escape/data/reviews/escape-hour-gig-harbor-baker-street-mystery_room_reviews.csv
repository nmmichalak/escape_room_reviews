"Escape room ""Baker Street Mystery"" by Escape Hour Gig Harbor in Gig Harbor",https://worldofescapes.com/gig-harbor/quests/escape-hour-gig-harbor-baker-street-mystery,0,We did the Baker escape as a group of 8 friends. Most of us have been friends for years and this was definitely one of the most fun things we have done. It was laid out well and Kelsey was awesome as a game master. We will be back to do the other challenges soon! We can definitely see how people could get a little addicted to this.

It was such a unique activity to do with friends. The clues are difficult, but doable. We made it out of the room with 5 minutes to spare. We'll all be coming back to try the cabin. I can't wait!!! If you're planning on having a meal with your group as well, I recommend doing it afterward because you will want to spend some time talking about the experience! The owners are awesome! Thank you guys, for this unforgettable experience!"
