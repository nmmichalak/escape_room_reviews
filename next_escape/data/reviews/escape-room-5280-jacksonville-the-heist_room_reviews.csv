"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Room 5280 in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-5280-jacksonville-the-heist,0,Very fun first experience. I would recommend the heist for larger groups. The Sherlock Homes room was a fun and creative challenge. Will come again! ðŸ”Ž

We were also late LOL. The service was amazing. They were able to accommodate us (group of 7) and we have a great time trying to figure out all of the clues and puzzles (the heist) . We would definitely do it again."

I would highly recommend going to this escape room over lot of the escape rooms in strip malls. They will slide tips under the door if you get stuck rather than stopping the whole room but coming over an intercom system."
