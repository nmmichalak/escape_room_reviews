"Escape room ""Mad Scientist"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-mad-scientist,0,"Had so much fun with the Mad Scientist Room today. First time doing an escape room as a family, and our 8 and 11 year old kids were able to contribute to most parts of the challenge. Only needed help once and finished with 9 seconds to spare! Highly recommended!"

It was fun and exciting for them. They are in 5th grade and did just fine figuring out clues! Take your kids to this experience... They will love it!!!!

Our team was 3 kids ages 9-13, and 2 moms... and it was very fun collaborating and problem-solving together. I highly recommend Quest Factor!"
