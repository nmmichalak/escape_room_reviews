It was only the 3 of us and our game master Jesse was great. He was really friendly and personable. We needed a lot of hints and help throughout James Bomb, and they were always there to help us through the next step. We failed nonetheless, but it was such a fun time. He was even nice enough to show us the end of the mission. We laughed for a long time and definitely made some great memories! We already booked another one for next weekend! Thanks for all the fun!"
