I have completed the Cabin, Imprisoned, and tested the new Puzzle master room. All are unique and come with their own challenges. The staff are friendly and are interested in your opinions of the rooms and are constantly thinking of new and creative rooms. If you want a challenge and a fun time I HIGHLY suggest you give one of the rooms a try."

As a huge fan of escape rooms, I can tell you this is top notch. Their puzzles and tasks are certainly challenging but not so overwhelming as to intimidate those new to escape rooms.  The Cabin room was a blast. The decor and immersive story really enhance the experience overall and it is my favorite room so far. So if you haven't tried Auburn Escape Zones, grab some friends and sign up for an hour of some of the best and most intense team building challenges you have ever faced!"
