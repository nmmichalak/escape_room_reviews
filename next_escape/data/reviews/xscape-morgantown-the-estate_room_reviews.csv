"Escape room ""The Estate"" by Xscape! Live Escape Games in Morgantown",https://worldofescapes.com/morgantown/quests/xscape-morgantown-the-estate,2,We were in the Morgantown WV area and came across the opportunity to play an Escape game. We played the Estate game. We found the loot but had one last clue to figure out how to release the booty. Even though we didn't win we still had a blast. The owners were super nice. We would recommend it to anyone who loves to solve a good mystery.

Would definitely return to do the new room when it opens, especially after being extremely pleased with THE ESTATE. I could not recommend this place more!"
