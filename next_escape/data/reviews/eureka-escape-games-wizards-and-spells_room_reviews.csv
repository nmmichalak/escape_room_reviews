"Escape room ""Wizards and Spells"" by Eureka Escape Games in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/eureka-escape-games-wizards-and-spells,0,My first escape room ever! It was a lot of fun! The wands were super cool. Our guide Steven was a great host. I can say for certain this was the best escape room I’ve ever done. 
"Escape room ""Wizards and Spells"" by Eureka Escape Games in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/eureka-escape-games-wizards-and-spells,1,Wizards and Spells was so much fun! Fairly challenging at points and you definitely feel accomplished with each task you complete. 3/4th of the way through the experience there was an unexpected twist to the room which made the whole experience just fantastic. I was a bit worried about the functionality of the wands but they actually worked without a hitch! My favorite escape room I’ve done so far.
"Escape room ""Wizards and Spells"" by Eureka Escape Games in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/eureka-escape-games-wizards-and-spells,2,We did the Wizards and Spells room tonight and had a great time. Our game host Steven was fantastic! We loved the room and the theme. Haven’t played anyone like it. I would suggest this room for parents and young teenagers to do together. The skill level is a littler easier but you would have fun as a family. We escaped with just the two of us. Will be back for sure!
