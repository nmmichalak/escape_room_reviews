"Escape room ""Doctor Psycho"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-doctor-psycho,0,"We played the Doctor Psycho room. It was GROSS! Haha but it a totally good way. You really feel like you are locked in a gross dungeon. This room is ranked ""medium"" on the website but we really struggled! We had to ask for a few hints and it still took us 45 minutes to escape. There was A LOT to do in this room too, and there was one really cool surprise element that made us laugh out loud.The game masters were very helpful and they have a big parking lot in back. We loved this location and once again we're super impressed by 60out!"

It was super intense and creepy but we LOVED it! Our game master was friendly and helpful. The lobby was really cute and cool! I will be going back for another room soon!
"Escape room ""Doctor Psycho"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-doctor-psycho,2,"Did this in a group of four. This room is really, really interesting. Well decorated and makes you feel like you are stuck in a really gross doctor's office. Make sure to look EVERYWHERE, we missed a lock and didn't realize it until we needed it towards the end. Despite some lock-and-key puzzles, there was still some cool tech in here and I enjoyed it. Interesting mix of sheer physical activity and brainpower. We escaped with very little time to spare and had an awesome time!"
"Escape room ""Doctor Psycho"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-doctor-psycho,3,The moment I walked in I was amazed and whisked away to amazing mazes and puzzles that not only gave me a high sense of adventure but also challenged me and helped me think. The puzzles are amazing and you're automatically drawn into the action whether you're chasing a criminal or saving the world. I had a phenomenal experience.
