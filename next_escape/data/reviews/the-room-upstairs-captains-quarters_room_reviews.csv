"Escape room ""Captain’s Quarters"" by The Room Upstairs in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-room-upstairs-captains-quarters,0,"I had such an amazing time here! This was my first visit, and we did the Captains Quarters. It was both challenging and a ton of fun. We barely made it out of the room (it was only two of us), and it was so rewarding! The atmosphere and props were spot on. The challenges were both suitably difficult and entertaining. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a true Escape Room experience. Ill be talking about this for years to come."

Highly recommend The Room Upstairs!
