"Escape room ""The Race Ruse"" by Race City Escapes in Mooresville",https://worldofescapes.com/mooresville/quests/Race-City-Escapes-The-Race-Ruse,1,"My husband and I completed The Race Ruse room on Saturday evening. We joined three couples we didn't know and worked together to finish the room with a little over 5 minutes to spare. The puzzles were challenging and fun! We met the owner and his son, they were both super friendly. We can't wait to go back and try our hands at the Harmonic Haze room!"
