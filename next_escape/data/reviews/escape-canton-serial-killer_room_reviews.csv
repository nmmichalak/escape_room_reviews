"Escape room ""Serial Killer"" by Escape Canton in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-canton-serial-killer,0,I was very nervous going into the serial killer room. Our attendant (3:45 PM 2/9) was extremely helpful! She was able to calm me down and tell me what to expect without giving anything away in the room. If it hadn't been for her I would not have gone in and had such a fun experience! The actual escape room was very fun and challenging. We had a hard time but we escaped! Thanks for a fun afternoon!
