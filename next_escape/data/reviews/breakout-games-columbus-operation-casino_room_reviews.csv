"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/breakout-games-columbus-operation-casino,0,A group of 8 of us had a wonderful time working together to get out of the room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The game was challenging and had lots of thought put into it.You are put into a room with the most basic instructions and then they let you do your work. You may ask for hints if you are stuck.Really fun time and I would highly recommend it.

"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/breakout-games-columbus-operation-casino,2,I just got back home from my first ever escape room. We did the Casino room. The room was brilliantly decorated and fit its theme. The puzzles were challenging but a whole lot of fun. Our game master did an excellent job explaining escape rooms to us first timers and when we needed one hint towards the end did so in a way that helped without giving the whole answer.

My sister and I did the casino room by ourselves as first timers. The game master and all the people there are SUPER nice and friendly. We loved it so much! We broke out just under the wire but we made it! We are definitely going back to try the other rooms.
