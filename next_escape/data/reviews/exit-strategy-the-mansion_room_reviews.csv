Christie was really great as the butler, and the room had a really cool “Clue” vibe. We’re excited about our next escape room there!"

The entire experience was filled with excitement, team work, head scratching, and being baffled!! With the help of our trusty clue giver (Christy who remained in character the entire time) we did find our way out!! The Mansions was a very authentic room filled with authentic props that were appropriately chosen for the room. Each opened door led to another clue, another room, and then out!! Can’t wait to go again and see what another room is like!"

We decided on the Mansion room. It was so cool! The puzzles were challenging but they made sense, the rooms were well decorated, and the staff was friendly and helpful! Lindsey was the staff member on duty at the time of our game, and she was great! Very sweet and friendly!Definitely recommend this location and the Mansion room! Looking forward to trying another sometime!"
