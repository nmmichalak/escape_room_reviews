"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,0,"This was my first escape room. I went with 3 friends and we were able to finish with 9 minutes left! (And we are minors) We had so much fun, and there were a lot of ‘aha’ moments. Overall, this was an amazing experience and I would love to come back! "
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,1,"This was the first time I have ever done an escape room, so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Two friends and I went and had the best time. It was nice to do something different. It was also nice to challenge yourself and really use your brain. The entire setup was very realistic and not janky. I have heard a lot of these types of escape rooms tend be cheap looking and use cheap props and this one was very nice. The owners have definitely put a lot of time and effort into making this a really awesome, organized experience that you can enjoy with friends, family and even coworkers. I will for sure be back to do more rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,2,"Such a fun but yet challenging experience! I went with two close friends of mine. We completed it with about 10 seconds to spare. GO US! The owners put a lot of work into the room to make it a realistic, fun experience. I had never done an escape room before and I walked away so excited to come back and do another one. For days I was talking about it and telling all my close friends and family about it. I highly recommend it!"
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,3,"Amazing story and room, the owner and staff were very friendly. Had a blast with my friends and solved the room, with only 1 minute and 50 seconds left. A great and fun thing you can do with your friends. Worth it! Everyone should check it out. They have a new room opening soon, will so be back!"
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,4,"My friends and I were not sure what to expect going in to solve this mystery, but it was fantastically constructed with twists and turns; great clues and just a really fun experience. You HAVE to try it!"
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,5,This was the 4th escape room I have been two (the others being in Vancouver) and I was really impressed. The level of interaction inside the room was a great change of pace and the subtle aid system made sure we didn't leave feeling disappointed like we did at many of the others. I'd definitely recommend this place for first timers or anybody wanting to check out escape games but even someone who has done quite a few of them like myself really loved it as well. 5/5 for sure.
"Escape room ""The Lazarus Crystal"" by Enigma HQ in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/enigma-hq-the-lazarus-crystal,6,"I'm a pretty avid gamer but I had never done an escape room before. So during a family trip to San Diego (after a half day at the Zoo), we brought a team of 5 Corleys intent on cracking this code. As we joked and stumbled our way through the riddles and lore, we chased a few too many red herrings on our exciting journey toward eventual defeat. Even the insights of my six year old (who was sometimes helpful!) did not allow us to 'defuse the bomb and save the world' in time.While frustrating, no game worth playing lets everyone win. Would I recommend it? Hell yeah! If you have a couple of clever friends and want something fun to do . . . or maybe even looking for the perfect double date activity to go along with dinner then absolutely: go for it.Can you prevail where 5 Corleys came up short? There's only one way to find out . ."

They made availability! Without giving away any of the plot line, we were forced to work together to solve a mystery and it had some great twists and turns! Solved it with one second left on the clock. Whew! Tons of fun and a great memory to share. Thank you, Enigma HQ, for a wonderful evening full of laughter and problem solving!"
