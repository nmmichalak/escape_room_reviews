"Escape room ""Knight's Quest"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-artifact,0,"So much fun! Challenging, rewarding experience for sure. We did the Knight’s Quest tonight & it was awesome. The room was so cool and I loved the decor and puzzles. I can’t wait to go back and try another room."
"Escape room ""Knight's Quest"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-artifact,1,Had a phenomenal time in the Knight’s Quest room! Steven and the other staff members turned an already exciting and challenging activity into the hour of a lifetime!
"Escape room ""Knight's Quest"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-artifact,2,"This was our first time and it was great! Did the artifact room with family members, and we didn't kill each other! Brandy was a fantastic ""guide"" and helped us just enough to point us in the right direction if we went off course. We got out with 11 seconds to spare and one hint left!"
"Escape room ""Knight's Quest"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-artifact,3,"We had a group of 8 and we completed the artifact room. Everything about our experience was incredible, from booking the room, to getting good instruction, having a great game master, just the entire experience as a whole. Half of our group had never attempted an escape room before, and those that had did it elsewhere (and thoroughly enjoyed this one more). We all had a blast and are currently planning our next trip back!"
