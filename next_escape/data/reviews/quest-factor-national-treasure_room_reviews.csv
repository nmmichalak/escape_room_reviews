"Escape room ""National Treasure"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-national-treasure,0,"Amazing! We did the National Treasure room & escaped with 50 seconds to spare!! The room was immersive, the puzzles were fun to solve & there were so many things to figure out that all three of us were kept busy! Will definitely be returning!!!"
"Escape room ""National Treasure"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-national-treasure,1,"My husband and I have escaped from over 15 different rooms, and Quest Factor rooms are some of the best! We just completed National Treasure and it's one of my favorites we've done, and Da Vinci and The Castle were quite good, too! The puzzles are varied and difficult enough to be a challenge but doable. Four of us did National Treasure today and we all always had something to do, often played off each other to solve things, and all felt useful and accomplished at the end! That's the measure of a great escape room to me. Often in rooms the puzzles are linear, so the whole group is working on one thing at a time, which leads to boredom, but at Quest Factor there are lots of different puzzles all available to be worked on at the same time so you never feel superfluous. The locks are also varied and all worked well. I highly recommend Quest Factor rooms!"
"Escape room ""National Treasure"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-national-treasure,2,The shoreline national treasure room was very fun and challenging. I was blown away on how cool it was. We are going to go to the next ones. I can't wait to see if anything can beat this. Could have used another hour. This is really something special and worth the money.
