"Escape room ""Escape The Hydeout"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-ca-escape-the-hydeout,0,This escape room is a wonderful addition to the OC and is awesome for newbies and veterans alike. The Hydeout room is a wonderful mixture of linear and nonlinear puzzles that definitely challenge the mind. The in-room mechanics gave it the extra nudge into 5 stars along with the friendly staff. Definitely recommending this spot to friends. Can't wait to try their other rooms!

The worker Joe who was working there was very kind, friendly, and funny. If you're in Anaheim as a local or visiting, I'd recommend this to anyone else to do this escape room!"

My husband, daughter and I made it out with only 3 minutes to spare! It was fun to spend the time together looking for clues and figuring out how to apply them to the challenge of finding the door key. Can""t wait to try the new rooms when they are ready! Kudos to Joe! He was great!"

This was a first escape game for me and I can't wait to try others! I went with family, a group of 9 and we all had a lot of fun! Very exciting when you figure out the clues and it opens a new door! I encourage everyone to try it! You have to all work together! The staff was very friendly and engaging! We also made it out with 9 seconds to spare, which totally made our night!! Highly recommend!!"
