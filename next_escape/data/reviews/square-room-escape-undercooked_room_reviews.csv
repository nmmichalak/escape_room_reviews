"Escape room ""Undercooked"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/square-room-escape-undercooked,0,"Had a great time.  We were a party of 5 and did the Uncooked game.  Person who checked us in explained everything clearly and answered all our questions.  At the end of game she went over how we did and explained some of the puzzles where were stuck on - eye opener!  lol  Everyone enjoyed themselves and would definitely go back and do it again.  Uncooked game was different from other escape room game types which was a nice surprise and change.  Instead of trying to beat the clock to get out of a room, you're fighting the clock to try to make as many recipes/dishes as possible - nice twist.  Good for all ages."
