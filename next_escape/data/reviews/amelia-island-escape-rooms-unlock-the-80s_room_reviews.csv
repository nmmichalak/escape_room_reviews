"Escape room ""Unlock The 80’s"" by Amelia Island Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/amelia-island-escape-rooms-unlock-the-80s,0,"After playing 50+ escape rooms throughout TN, GA, and the Carolinas and working at an escape room for 1.5 years, Amelia Island Escape’s “Escape the 80s” Room was my FAVORITE escape room I’ve completed yet.The set dressing was phenomenal, specifically for a locally owned in-house design. The dollhouse created by the owner was absolutely breathtaking (I do hope she’ll decide to encase the small rooms with a glass or acrylic barrier - the incredible attention to detail made me so nervous, as I know how easy it is for customers to get excited and forget what NOT to touch!) The variety of puzzle types was so impressive. Often, escape rooms are bogged down by repetitive puzzle types (translations, object-counting, etc) but this room had such unique puzzles, all perfectly woven into the logical storyline of the adventure itself. If you’re visiting Amelia Island and either enjoy escape rooms or are considering trying one for the first time, this adventure is well-worth the cash and, despite only lasting one hour, will give you something to talk about for the rest of the day!"

You have to solve a room to get into the room! Wow that was great! It was a blast from the past for My oldest and myself. We were distracted by the 80's memorabilia in the room, so the younger ones really came to the game! This is our 3rd room and we plan on booking the last one to test our mental capacity. The Escape rooms are so much fun for the whole family or just a group of friends. Try it, you'll get hooked too!"
"Escape room ""Unlock The 80’s"" by Amelia Island Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/amelia-island-escape-rooms-unlock-the-80s,2,We called in advance to set up 2 rooms (Greybeard's and Unlock the 80's) for our family of 15. They were fantastic in accommodating us with a toddler in one of our groups. Sage and Natalie were very friendly and helpful as we played. We all had a wonderful time and enjoyed a little family competition as well! Thank you so much!
