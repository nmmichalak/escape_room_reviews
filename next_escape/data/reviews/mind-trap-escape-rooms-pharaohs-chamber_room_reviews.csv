(Boys 15 & 17) Pharaoh's Tomb was challenging but doable with the aide of hints from the staff via walkie-talkie.We are anxious to try another ""room"" with a little scare factor.  I was impressed by the difficulties of the clues but also the simplicity of them once we relaxed and tried to make sense of them.  We will be back."
