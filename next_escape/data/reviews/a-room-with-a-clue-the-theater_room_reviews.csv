"Escape room ""The Theater"" by A Room with a Clue in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/a-room-with-a-clue-the-theater,0,"I like to mention in my reviews that I have played hundreds of escape games all across North America. This place had a lot of potential, but a few things really bothered me.The Theater room: There is a math puzzle in this room commonly known as the ""Peg Jumping Game"", which I was familiar with. This is extremely difficult to figure out if you don't have the ""grid"" to play the game with. We were provided the ""pegs"", but not any type of board/grid to help figure out the puzzle. I would suggest replacing this with another puzzle.The other thing that bothered me was the final puzzle involving the light board. The game master eventually had to tell us what to do, and I got the impression that this happens all the time. It was fun playing around with the lighting board and controlling the stage lights, but the ultimate solution of what you were supposed to figure out was very, very unclear."
"Escape room ""The Theater"" by A Room with a Clue in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/a-room-with-a-clue-the-theater,1,We did the Theatre room and it was so much fun! The clues and puzzles were not too difficult for us and we had such a great time going from one clue to the next. We have already talked about going back and trying another room! There were no creepy zombies trying to attack or anything so there was no added distraction. The room was very well planned out and I would recommend this place highly!
