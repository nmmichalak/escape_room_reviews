"Escape room ""The Wizard"" by Amazing Escape Room in Freehold",https://worldofescapes.com/freehold/quests/Amazing-Escape-Room-The-Samuri-Room,0,"3 of us did the Wizard Room last night. Awesome time. Very well thought out. Like others said, just the right amount of guidance. We had 2 others in the room with us. Made it out just in time! This was my first escape room. Great time. Definitely going back for the other rooms."

My family of four worked together with another family of four, and we made it out with just a few minutes to spare. Our game master, Sam, was terrific. Very friendly and helpful, gave us just enough guidance when we needed a clue, but not so much that it took away from the challenge. We've done three escape rooms, and this one was everyone's favorite. Great time!"
"Escape room ""The Wizard"" by Amazing Escape Room in Freehold",https://worldofescapes.com/freehold/quests/Amazing-Escape-Room-The-Samuri-Room,2,First time in an escape room and we found the wizard room was truly a blast! 8 of us having to work together and figure out clues that pertain to a story was truly exciting. Our game master Mike was a lot of fun especially when we needed clues he kept the secret with just enough to push us in the right direction. Can't wait to do it again!

We were 10 people and we had the room to ourselves. We did the Wizard room. We escaped with 20 minutes to spare. The clues were intriguing, and we did get totally stumped at one point, but figured it out at the end. We would def recommend and even want to go back and try another room."

It was so much fun! The staff was extremely helpful and patient with the boys. They're already talking about conquering another room. If you want something different to try, it's perfect!"
