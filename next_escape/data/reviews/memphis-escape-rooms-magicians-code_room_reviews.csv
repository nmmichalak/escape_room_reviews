"Escape room ""Magician's Code"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/memphis-escape-rooms-magicians-code,0,This room came highly recommended to our group. The attention to detail is wonderful. This lends to a wholly-immersive experience. The puzzles are moderate to slightly difficult to solve. Some aspects of this room are limiting to large groups as the spaces entered can only be occupied by 1-3 people at a time. This leads to a large lean on communication skills and identifying strengths and weaknesses in the group dynamic (which means this can be an excellent team-building activity for workplace associates) There is an awesome wow-factor in the solution of many puzzles. Excellent for kids!
