"Escape room ""The Factory - A Gas Works Company"" by Epic Escape Game in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/epic-escape-game-the-factory,5,"So much fun! Staff was friendly and helpful. We had a group of nine and did The Factory. The room was a little small for that large group, but the staff warned us and it was our choice to stay together. Just saying that a group of four or five would be the perfect size. Highly recommend this as a team building event, couples night out, etc. You won't be disappointed."

You have an hour to complete each room and you can call for up to three clues. It was a fun challenge! Your group needs to communicate, try ideas, and work well together. Some of the puzzles & clues were pretty difficult to solve. I would like to come back later and attempt their other two escape rooms. One thing that is cool is that they have two Factory rooms so two different groups can start it at the same time & challenge each other to see who finishes first. Also, the staff here are very friendly."
