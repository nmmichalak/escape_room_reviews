"Escape room ""Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge"" by Brainy Actz in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/brainy-actz-irvine-mystery-at-the-lost-pointe-lodge,0,"This is only the second escape room ive done but it I've definitely got the bug now. A friend and I did the Mystery Lodge room. It was certainly a challenge with just two of us, but our guide, Adam, did a great job of laying out the scenario and giving us hints that were juuust enough to keep us going without feeling like we were having our hands held. He definitely helped draw us into the experience with his intro.I was very surprised by the quality of the room as well. Wherever I expected something go be a bit 'low budget', I was pleasantly wrong. There is a lot of thought and effort to making a lot of these secret hatches cool and surprising. Just when I thought something was only another decoration, a puzzle would pop it open.The whole place was clean and professional too. A definite thumbs up, and ill be back for sure with more people to try one of the larger rooms.Thanks again Adam!"

Did the Mystery at Lost Point Lodge room with family and friends.Ok so we were more like a bunch of bumbling fools but we did figure out some clues on our own.   Wow Bobby and Monica were fun, friendly and professional.  Will be coming back again to try different rooms.The Ceniceros and Merlin family."

When I first walked in, the room felt very authentic, the sounds, the props made me feel like I was in a lodge. The things we had to figure out and find was fun. It was a great experience overall and I hope to go back soon to escape some of their other puzzle rooms."
