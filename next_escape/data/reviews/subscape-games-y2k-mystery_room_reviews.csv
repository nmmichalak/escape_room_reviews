"Escape room ""Y2K Mystery"" by SUBScape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/subscape-games-y2k-mystery,0,"Y2K Virus was the first room we did.  I feel that this was the easiest of the three rooms we did.  I thought the puzzles were challenging, but simple enough to figure out.  I don't think that there was a moment where we didn't know what we were supposed to do in this room.  It's easy to connect the dots and figure out what to do.  I would say this is an easy-intermediate difficulty room, and would recommend this if this is your first time or if you aren't that experienced at escape rooms.  We were told that Stage Call is their easiest room at Subscape, so if you are a beginner, you can start there as well.  "
