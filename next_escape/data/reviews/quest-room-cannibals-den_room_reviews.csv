"Escape room ""Cannibal’s Den"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-cannibals-den,0,"We did the cannibal room and it was scary and so much fun! Our group worked together to find clues and help each other ""escape"" from the cannibal room. Everything looked so realistic and detailed. You'll have adrenaline pumping through you the entire time. There was a lot of effort out into production which ultimately helps it all seem realistic."
