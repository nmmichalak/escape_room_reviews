"Escape room ""The Office of the Double Agent 33"" by Elusive Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/elusive-escape-rooms-the-office-of-double-agent-33,0,"This is my 4th escape room I've done. My wife and are are pretty good most of the time. The Agent 33 was VERY difficult. We did not make it out but had a great time trying to get it. The game master ""Katie"" was very helpful when we needed it and was always good for a laugh. Now the negative, the room had really no way of cooling off. We had 6 people in the group and we were all running around. It's also hot outside. Minor thing to think about. I would still recommend this place! Great fun for all ages!"
