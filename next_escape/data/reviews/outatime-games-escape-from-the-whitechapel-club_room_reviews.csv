"Escape room ""Escape from the Whitechapel Club"" by Outatime Games in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/outatime-games-escape-from-the-whitechapel-club,2,"I was really impressed with the room, considering that other rooms in Chicago proper are nearly twice as expensive, but the experience here was definitely above average with regards to the room.  It did feel a bit like there was a bit more volume than difficulty, but I believe they get a lot of kids groups being in the suburbs so that makes sense.  That being said we went with 7 people and had a great time.  They take up to 12 people and I feel like that's probably more than what you need, with our group we felt like we were all doing something for the most part except for at the start and at the finish.We had extra appreciation for confirmation on when puzzles or clues are solved properly, and you know if it's just a matter of fidgeting with the lock a bit more to get it to open or if you need to keep working on the puzzle."
