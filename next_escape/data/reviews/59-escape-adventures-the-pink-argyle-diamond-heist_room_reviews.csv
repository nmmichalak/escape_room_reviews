There were four of us and we did the Diamond Heist. We were absolutely clueless, but they gently guided us through. We made it out with five seconds to spare! It was a blast and want to try another room!!"

We had a blast! The game masters were super nice and were super fun. The Diamond Heist was challenging and filled with a ton of surprises. We will absolutely return to do the mad scientist room.

They were great at guiding our team in the right direction when we needed a little push. They were also very helpful and friendly!"

We worked together just the two of us and we had a blast. Not only did it help us to work together as a team but it helped us to grow in our communication skills and to just do something fun and unique together. I highly recommend this place. It's something different that far surpasses the fun of going to a movie or out to ice cream.
