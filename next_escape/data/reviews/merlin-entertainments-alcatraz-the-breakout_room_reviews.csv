"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,1,This was the best escape room I've done!  It's pretty challenging but solvable.  We learned at the end that there are a few ways to solve some of the puzzles which was really cool.  I did this escape room with a group of friends and we had a blast and really enjoyed our night.

We had quickly figured out WHAT we had to do, but it was so difficult, I almost believed that it wasn't the right thing to do. I've done many escape rooms, and usually the difficult part is figuring out WHAT the puzzle is, not solving the puzzle. But in general, I really liked many of the puzzles, and especially the theme."
