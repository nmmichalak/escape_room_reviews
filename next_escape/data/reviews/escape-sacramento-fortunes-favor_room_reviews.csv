Josh was our guide and he did an awesome job!! He explained what we needed to do and put us at ease. He was super positive and didn't make us feel""stupid"".This was a change of pace from out every other month bookclub gather and we all had a blast! We solved many of the clues and unlocked the treasures. We really enjoyed this and I highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Fortune's Favor"" by Escape Sacramento in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escape-sacramento-fortunes-favor,1,"Super fun times solving Fortunes Favor! This one is a cool cave/forest feel. Really beautifully constructed to transport you into another place. I have previously done The Seance, Gallery, and Heist here and each challenge presents new solutions and methods that I've never experienced before. They really go the extra mile here. We had a great time with five of us in the room. The premise was fun and played on cultural knowledge. It had a mild level of creepiness/darkness which I personally prefer to heighten the excitement. Caitlyn (sp?) was a great hostess. Having the 8pm time slot, I think she let us have an extra 15min because we were on a roll. We really appreciated that because it let us fully discover the room and succeed rather than cue the lights and open the door with remaining unsolved puzzles. We will definitely be back here for another challenge next month. Maybe The Space Station... Our team can't wait!"
