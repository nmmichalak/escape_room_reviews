"Escape room ""Star Trek: Discovery VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-star-trek-discovery,0,"I'm a longtime VR enthusiast and have been following the ups and downs of the industry for years. Unfortunately, VR has been a disappointment and I've been waiting for someone to bring great hardware and content together, and give me a reason to believe again. Enter, Sandbox VR.They call themselves a ""holodeck"" so, as a Star Trek purist, my expectations are sky high. I better feel like I'm knee deep in a Klingon swamp or spending a weekend in Risa with some lovely green ladies, or else I'll be disappointed.Well, after playing BOTH Sandbox experiences, I can say that my mind is completely BLOWN. It's by far the best VR experience I've had to date, especially if you're used to being a floating head on a disorienting roller coaster demo. This is NOT that. You move in the environment with your pals as perfectly mapped, MOCAP'd characters so there's no sense of feeling dizzy. The haptics make it feel like those zombies are really about to eat my face! It's practically an otherworldly experience that you have to see the believe.While there's currently a limited amount of content that's focused primarily on horror/survival themes, it's only a matter of time before we can take a pilates class or travel beyond the stars in VR. I, for one, came to play. Bring it on Sandbox!"
