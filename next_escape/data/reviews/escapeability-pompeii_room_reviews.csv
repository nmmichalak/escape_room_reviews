Very challenging but had us all talking about coming back again. Will be back!"
"Escape room ""Pompeii​"" by ESCAPEability in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapeability-pompeii,1,This is the first escape room I've been to in Vegas. It was amazing! I have yet to go to one with multiple rooms and Pompeii was! Went with a few buddies of mine who are a couple of the shaper tools in the shed. And we were all stumped on a couple of them! I thought it was well thought out and will definitely be back to do Casino Takeover where we will compete against each other! Can't wait!

It was a good horror escape challenge. This time I went to do Pompeii. Omg! It was tough. But my group and I manage to get out. If you like though clues, this one you should try."

I plan on coming back soon with a big group of friends to try the casino room. It's team versus team which sounds awesome.

Management was super friendly and took the time to explain the rooms and the process. Started with Pompeii and had such a great experience that our group added the Mars room to our day. Go! You will enjoy!!
