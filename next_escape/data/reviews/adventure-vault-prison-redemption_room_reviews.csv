"Escape room ""Prison Redemption"" by Adventure Vault in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/adventure-vault-prison-redemption,3,I went with 4 friends on Friday and had an awesome time. We did the Prison Break. It was our first time ever doing an escape room. We used our three clues available. But once we got the hang of what to look for we cruised on through and we were shocked that we actually escaped. (1 min overtime). We can't wait to go back to try another theme. A fun thing to do for sure.

The staff was so friendly and accommodating, the place was very clean and the experience of trying to escape out of the room was so much fun and the perfect amount of challenge. We were in the prison room which is their hardest room. I will definitely be going back with family and friends and would recommend this place to anyone. It's perfect for birthday party's, office party's etc. I am 8 months pregnant and was able to enjoy such an adventure thanks to their accommodations."
