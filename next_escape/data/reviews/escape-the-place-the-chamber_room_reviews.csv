"Escape room ""The Chamber"" by Escape the Place in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escape-the-place-the-chamber,0,"This room is wild! It will make you feel so smart and yet so stupid depending on which puzzle you just worked on. The best part though? Competing against your friends who are working on an identical room, stealing clues from them, riding the adrenaline as you beat the clock and beat them out of the escape room. Totally worth the effort. "

Did The Chamber with our group of three and had a blast! The only piece we didn't like were the malfunctioning locks that weren't opening with the right combination entered. Otherwise, a must play, challenging and fun!"
