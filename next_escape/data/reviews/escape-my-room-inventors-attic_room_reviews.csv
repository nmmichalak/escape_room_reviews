It was quite challenging, but we escaped and solved the mystery. I had an absolute blast and can not wait to return to try the next room."
"Escape room ""Inventor's Attic"" by Escape My Room in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/escape-my-room-inventors-attic,2,"This was my first ever escape room and I can honestly say, I loved it! From the second you enter the building, you're involved in the game. The decor and rooms were spectacular and very well done. As an author, I was blown away with the attention to detail.We did the Inventor's Attic and escaped in about half an hour then did bonus puzzles. Next, we did the Jazz Room and it was more complicated but also super fun. We also escaped with a little time to spare. It was my first but it won't be my last!"
