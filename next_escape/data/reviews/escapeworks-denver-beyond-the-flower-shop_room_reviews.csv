"Escape room ""Beyond the Flower Shop"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-beyond-the-flower-shop,0,Went and did the flower shop speakeasy room on a Friday night with work friends.   The puzzles were fairly difficult but fun!   Lidet was our game hostess.  She not only provided much needed clues when we needed them but also lots of encouragement!    Don't be surprised if she makes you dance for a clue!!   So much fun!

It was challenging, but the clues help. We didn't finish, but came very close. We did the flower shop. Can't wait to try another room."
