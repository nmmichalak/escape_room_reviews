"Escape room ""Chocolate Factory"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-the-chocolate-factory,0,"My husband and I recently did Escape Room 101's newest room-The Chocolate Factory. This was our first game since doing 3 lackluster rooms in Socal. We were not disappointed. Lots of puzzles and games to stimulate the ""little grey cells"". Our gamemaster was Sean who, as always, was a great clue giver. He made our visit fun and worthwhile. (Thx, Sean!) The room was family friendly, bright, colorful and fun. After the experience, we signed up to do the VR escape room for my husband's birthday next month. We can't wait! We highly recommend this business as ""must-do"" to locals and travelers alike."
