Not only was the game beautifully done, the story was cool, the effects were top notch, and I highly recommend! We did Cremlock Manor, and I will be coming back to try all of the other games! The best part of this experience was our game guide, Shane. He was the friendliest and most knowledgeable game host I have ever had, and I’ve done a bunch of escape rooms. He was engaged, fun, hilarious, and very helpful! We were a rowdy group of friends doing the last game of the night, and if he had been there all day, you couldn’t tell it! Give that man a raise and a promotion! Thanks Shane, you are the best!"
