"Escape room ""The Western Saloon Robbery"" by Crazy Cat Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/crazy-cat-escape-room-the-western-saloon-robbery,0,"Very fun and challenging. We did the Saloon and the Scene of the Crime. The Saloon was definitely more challenging, but I think the crime scene was more fun. I'm giving this place 4 stars because we have been to three total escape rooms, and this is by far the most expensive."

I definitely would recommend, the room was not extremely difficult (although we used all 3 clues) and the service was very friendly, helpful, and funny!We had a group of 4 adults and 2 kids.Both the kids and the adults really enjoyed themselves."

The room and clues made in exciting and fun for each team member.  Enjoyed the ability to work together, seek solutions, and laugh during the time in the room.  The room was challenging, but you had the ability to have 3 extra clues as required if the team needed them."
