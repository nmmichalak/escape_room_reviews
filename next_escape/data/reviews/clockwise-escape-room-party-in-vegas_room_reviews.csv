"Escape room ""Party in Vegas"" by ClockWise Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clockwise-escape-room-party-in-vegas,1,Our family went to the Las Vegas escape room and we had such a good time. We managed to get out in 50 minutes. Well worth it. The event coordinator was welcoming and funny. Coming back for the asylum room next time we are in town.

This was my 3rd time going to an escape room in general and this was my favorite so far. We did the Hangover room and had a great time! I can't wait to go back and try the asylum next time.

It is fun and an easier room to escape, even here we had to ask for a couple clues, thankfully we got out on time. Next time we will go back to try the Asylum room. Good location and pretty assistance working at the front desk."
"Escape room ""Party in Vegas"" by ClockWise Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clockwise-escape-room-party-in-vegas,4,Came for my 9th and 10th escape room! My friend and I tried both the Asylum and Party in Vegas rooms. They are still pretty new so the tech worked very well. It's not so much of search and find like some other rooms. This is strictly puzzles and solving riddles. Party in Vegas was so much FUN!!! It was a nice pace of change compared to other serious rooms. The decor was great and highly immersive. But I would say it's one of the easier escape rooms. We only had three people and escaped in 53 mins.
