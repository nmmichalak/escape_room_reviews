"Escape room ""Game of Espionage"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-ann-arbor-game-of-espionage,0,"Really enjoyed this Escape Room. Really clever hint mechanisms and the production value for the rooms is right on. Friendly, polite staff (thank you, Josh!). Brought a group of five for the Espionage room. We were super close but didn't make it out in time. Had a different group for the Circus one made it out in respectable time. Clues are open-ended enough to be difficult, but closed enough that you typically know when you've solved them. Worth it."
