"Escape room ""Central Intelligence"" by Tick Tock Escape Room in Overland Park",https://worldofescapes.com/overland-park/quests/tick-tock-escape-games-central-intelligence,0,"I have now done all three escape rooms at Tick Tock (Beasley's Billions, Pyramid Paradox and Central Intelligence). They are all unique and really well designed with lots of fun, challenging puzzles and cool elements. The game masters are great at providing relevant clues as needed. I hope they will add another room soon!"
