"Escape room ""The Society"" by Escape Room Entertainment in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-room-entertainment-the-society,0,Had a great time escaping The Society. Very clever puzzles to put your mind to work. Several clues to figure out the attempt to escape. Our entire group had a great time! Looking forward to returning to Elite Escape Room in the future!

It was an awesome experience thanks to her patience with us, and the kids loved it. We will definitely be returning to try a different room and hopefully weâ€™ll get her as our guide again. Thank You"
