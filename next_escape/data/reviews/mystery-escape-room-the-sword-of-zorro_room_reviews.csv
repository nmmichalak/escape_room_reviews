"Escape room ""The Sword of Zorro"" by Mystery Escape Room in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/mystery-escape-room-the-sword-of-zorro,0,We did the Zorro room with a group of 7 with ages varying from 10-39 we did not finish it but we still had an amazing time. Our guide Garret was very funny and we really appreciated his help. Each of puzzles were different and fun to solve. I would 100% recommend this experience to others.
