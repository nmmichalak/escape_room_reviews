"Escape room ""Enchanted Forest"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-enchanted-forest,1,"Just did the Enchanted Forest this last weekend for a friend's early birthday celebration. The Forest was super awesomely set up, it was gloomy and only mildly creepy if you're faint of heart, and the puzzles themselves were clever and entertaining. I don't like it much if they focus too heavily on math or calculations (simply because it's harder to do as a group activity) but this one had fun puzzles that you could do independently or with someone else.I definitely want to try the other rooms at this location now!"
