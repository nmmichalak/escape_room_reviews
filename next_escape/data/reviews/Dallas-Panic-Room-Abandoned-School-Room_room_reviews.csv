"Escape room ""Abandoned School Room"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/Dallas-Panic-Room-Abandoned-School-Room,0,We had a great time trying to find keys to locks and codes to figure out the combo locks on the Abandoned Schoolhouse to find the blueprints to give to the right person before we blew up. We escaped with only 3 seconds. Will recommend this to anyone wanting a challenging fun event. Thanks for a fun night!

None of us had ever done an escape room before, and we all had a great time! We escaped with 12 minutes to spare, so will probably go for a more difficult one next time. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable, we will certainly be back to try more rooms!"

It was definitely a great idea to stop by the DPR for an adventure filled with fun! Friendly staff as well!
