Very accommodating with time availability and easy to book it as private, which we prefer. Also great for adults and kids, we brought our 7 year old and she had fun too. Very fun!!"

We absolutely had a blast! I will definitely be back and will do more group events in the future!You guys did a great job building the scene and making the escape a little harder than we thought weâ€™d experience.Thanks for having us!
