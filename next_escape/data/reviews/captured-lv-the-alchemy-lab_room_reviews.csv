"Escape room ""The Alchemy Lab"" by Captured LV Escape Room in Bethlehem",https://worldofescapes.com/bethlehem/quests/captured-lv-the-alchemy-lab,0,Had a great time as a team activity with my peers. The Alchemy Lab was a blast! It was great to get together with my co-workers in a different setting outside of work and work together to try to solve these clues to try to escape.

We did the Alchemy Lab and it was new and refreshing way to spend an afternoon. It allowed our group to bond and explore together. My group has been together since elementary school and none of us had ever done anything like that and we've never all worked towards the same goal like that (we prefer to compete against each other). I'm happy to say, we escaped!"
