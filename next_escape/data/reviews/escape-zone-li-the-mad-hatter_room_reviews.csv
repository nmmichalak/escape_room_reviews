We did the mad hatter room. Totally worth every penny. Rooms were decorated for the theme well and there was a lot of clues and plenty of things that had to be done to escape. We went with 8 people which was the max, and it didn't feel crowded. We had so much fun! Special thanks to their employee Matt! He was so nice, flawlessly answered all of our questions and gave us clues when needed. He definitely played big a part of our great experience at escape zone!"

We had 8, 9-10 yr olds; 2, 7 yr olds, and 2 adults. We split up into 2 teams with an adult for each room. It was so much fun! They girls had a blast as well as my husband and I. We were laughing all night long about how insanely cute they kids were trying to figure out the puzzles using the clues we found within the room. Definitely bring your thinking cap though bc it is very challenging but really fun at the same time. My daughter told me, it was the best birthday and the escape room was exactly what she had wanted it to be. I highly recommend Escape Zone Long Island. The staff was super friendly and very acomidating as well!!"
