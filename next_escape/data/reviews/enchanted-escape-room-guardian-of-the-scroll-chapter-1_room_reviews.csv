"Escape room ""Guardian of the Scroll - Chapter 1"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-guardian-of-the-scroll-chapter-1,0,"We loved this place so much we did 2 challenges in 1 day. Literally finished one and we were so pumped we paid for another same day. Not so hard that it is impossible to escape, but challenging enough to make you brain work. We are actually planning on going again in a week for my bachelorette party! A must try if you want to do an escape room. There isn't enough words to explain how awesome this place is! It has never disappointed us!"
