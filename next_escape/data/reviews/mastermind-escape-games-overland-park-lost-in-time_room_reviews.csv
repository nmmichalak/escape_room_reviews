"Escape room ""Lost In Time"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Overland Park",https://worldofescapes.com/overland-park/quests/mastermind-escape-games-overland-park-lost-in-time,1,We came here for date night on Tuesday night and were lucky to have the Lost in Time room to ourselves. The clues were great and unique compared to other escape rooms we've been to. I love that they put a lot of effort into the decor and were so creative! The staff was awesome. They were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back soon to try another room.
