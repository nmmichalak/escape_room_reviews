"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-outbreak,0,"We decided to attempt this room because my boyfriend is a huge Fallout fan. I personally didn't think this room was too challenging, as everything was pretty linear and straightforward for the most part. High production value, and overall fun experience. Would recommend to anyone who likes Fallout or is looking to do an escape room with a smaller group since the max is 4 for this room. "

Neither of us knew what we were doing but with the help of Felicia, our host, we finished with 7.49 minutes to spare! Great fun can't wait to do another one. Fun for all ages."

I love the player-friendly style (unlimited hints, delivered via loudspeaker), the incredible attention to detail in the room, and Special Agent Crystal was an awesome element to the story-telling!"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-outbreak,3,I organized a group event for my company here. It was a fun to try to work out way out of the rooms. Damien and the rest of the staff were incredibly helpful. Puzzles were challenging but worth the experience so I highly recommend 60 out. They were in the process of building two new rooms so it looks like we'lol probably be back soon for another round.

The puzzles were challenging but not impossible. I loved the sets in both the rooms. The game masters were fun, friendly, and helpful. A great way to spend an hour! I have already booked my third room with them. Thanks to 60out I'm completely hooked on escape rooms. "
