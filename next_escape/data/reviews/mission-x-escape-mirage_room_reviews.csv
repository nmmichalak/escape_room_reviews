"Escape room ""Mirage"" by Mission X Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/mission-x-escape-mirage,0,This was a great first experience. The staff was very helpful and me and my boyfriend loved our first experience. We booked this the same day because we were tired of the same old movie and dinner night. We called to learn more information and Jenna( I believe that's her name and sorry if misspelled) answered all our questions. Will definitely be back !! The room we escaped was the Mirage awesome first choice
