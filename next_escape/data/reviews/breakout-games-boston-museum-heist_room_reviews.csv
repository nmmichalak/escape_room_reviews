They said the clues were great, the puzzle was challenging and they can't wait to go again. Happy to have something like this so close to home!"

I was hesitant when booking since it was our first time. But both my kids (10 and 14-year-olds) loved it! We will be coming back for the other rooms for sure.

The staff is awesome, giving enough help so you don't feel helpless, but not so much that you feel like you're being spoon-fed the answers. Can't wait to come again."

We did the Museum Heist and escaped with 7 minutes remaining. The only downfall was it was over to quick! I could have gone right onto another one. Definitely will be going back!
