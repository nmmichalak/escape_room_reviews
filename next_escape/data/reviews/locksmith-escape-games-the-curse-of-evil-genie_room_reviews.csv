"Escape room ""The Curse of the Evil Genie"" by Locksmith Escape Games in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/locksmith-escape-games-the-curse-of-evil-genie,0,"This was mine and my boyfriends first escape room and we chose “Break free from inside the genies lamp”. Our experience was nothing short of thrilling, entertaining and just pure fun!! The rooms are super detailed and make you feel like you are in a different place. The staff(game masters) were super knowledgeable, welcoming and sweet! They explained everything thoroughly and made it the best experience possible! They even have a trial puzzle in the lobby area for you to try before you go into your escape room that was really fun and helpful if you’ve never done one before! Overall our experience was a 10/10, and we will definitely be going back!"

My young daughter was also with us and she was able to participate and had a blast! The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. Will definitely come back to play the other games. Thank you for such a great time!!

We have been waiting for this place to open for a few months and couldn’t wait to try it out. When we got in the room, it was theme really well. Everything seems to go together. The puzzles were pretty fun and interesting. This is their hardest room right now, I would recommend doing it with four people to not get down to the very last seconds. It was only two of us and barely escaped. Staff was friendly and definitely helpful! Can’t wait to come back to try their other rooms."
