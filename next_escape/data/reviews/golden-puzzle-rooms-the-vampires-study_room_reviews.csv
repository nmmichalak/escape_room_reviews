We took my husband here for his birthday and all 8 of us had a great time working together and trying to figure out the way out of the room! Thank you Golden Puzzle Rooms for a unique afternoon and we will definitely be back again!!"
"Escape room ""The Vampire's Study"" by Golden Puzzle Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/golden-puzzle-rooms-the-vampires-study,1,I took my husband for his birthday and he loved it. It was just the 2 of us in the room so there were just too many puzzles for us to complete. So definitely take more people. We had so much fun and will do this again!

You've got something good here, and I hope it continues to grow. My experience was so much fun, even though my group was soooooo frickin close but still soooo far away from completing the whole thing. I'll be back for new rooms & new puzzles. Thanks for this night of fun!"

And there was a tremendous amount of fun to be had. I will say that to get there, you need to go to the J St/K St alley on 10th St. The entrance is right next to Pre Flite bar. When it was time to get puzzling, Matthew the Butler came to fetch us and give us the lowdown. We didn't escape, but we were so close it made my heart hurt. Regardless, we had a spectacular time and it was well worth it! When they change it up, we absolutely will be back for more."
