It was very difficult and fun too. We didn't get out, but we were close and almost made it. The owners are so kind and they make your experience even more enjoyable! This is a wonderful and fun thing to do with family, friends, co-workers - great team building exercise too. Thanks to the wonderful owners who are so kind and so much fun too!!! Love Operation: Escape Room, if you haven't been here yet, you must treat yourself and go!"

I have tried 3 different rooms. We did the whispering sister ( which we did not escape), the greyed beard ( was close, but did not succeed) and finally Dixmont ( which we got out!!!!!) Woot Woot!! I really enjoyed both The Grey Beard and Dixmont. Thank you for providing such great entertainment. We will be back for the new rooms."
