"Escape room ""Redemption"" by Key to Escape in Statesville",https://worldofescapes.com/statesville/quests/key-to-escape-redemption,2,We were celebrating my sons Birthday and spent the evening in the Redemption Room. It was so much fun! We have gone to many different Escape rooms and this one is right up there at the top of our list. Great design and so much detail put into the room and story. It was very challenging with all the many different puzzles to figure out which is everything you look for in a great Escape room! The owners and staff are so friendly and helpful. I 100% recommend giving them a try. You will be glad you did!
