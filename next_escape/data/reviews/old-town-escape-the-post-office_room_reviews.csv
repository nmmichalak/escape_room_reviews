You will be challenged to get out of the Post Office in less than an hour. Lots of nice touches, which I can't reveal, and lots of local flavor. A nice way to spend an afternoon or evening in Mankato."

I loved the Post Office room and I wish I had a time machine so could experience it for the first time all over again. I can't wait to play the Witch's Kitchen the next time I'm in Mankato! Seriously, if you haven't been to Old Town Escape yet, cancel today's plans and go!"
"Escape room ""The Post Office"" by Old Town Escape in Mankato",https://worldofescapes.com/mankato/quests/old-town-escape-the-post-office,4,We would HIGHLY recommend this experience to others! This was our family's first ever escape room. We did the Post Office room with kids - 11 and 13 years old and loved it. The host was very friendly and did an excellent job and dropping clues along the way. We would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fun night out.
