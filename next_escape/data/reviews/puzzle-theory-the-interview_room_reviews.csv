"Escape room ""The Interview"" by Puzzle Theory in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/puzzle-theory-the-interview,0,We went with a group of six people to celebrate my birthday and did the Interview. The puzzle was well designed and we had a great time solving it. I liked that we got to take home our magnet ID badge from the escape room. I can't wait to go back!

There was a good blend of easy to hard puzzles and if you get stuck staff can provide a clue or hint to help you. If you are looking for something new to do with friends or looking for something to build team work then check out Puzzle Theory. I have done quite a few escape rooms and this one was the best."

He had seen one done on a TV show and liked the idea. So we dragged my sister and brother-in-law along with us and completed ""The Interview"". We had an absolute blast and were so excited to solve the puzzle with 28 seconds left. We will definitely return to complete the other rooms. A great activity for when the weather isn't the greatest."

We completed ""The Interview"" with just about a minute to spare and only used 2 clues! I cannot wait to go back to try the second room in the Dr.X series! It's a great way to really put your heads together and I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a night out away from the norm! Team ""Meow"" for the win!"
