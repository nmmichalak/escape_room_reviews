"Escape room ""Immunity Quest"" by Locked in Fun in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/locked-in-fun-immunity-quest,1,This was our first time at an escape room. We really enjoyed ourselves. We will be coming back to try the other room.

It was challenging and fun. There are two rooms, and we did the 'easier' Immunity room (45 minutes) - it was still quite tough! Great fun for family, friend, and work outings. There is nothing scary so it's great for people with kids or for scaredy-cats :) we finished with exactly 4 seconds to spare, with a little help from the game monitor. Wonderful experience, and I'd highly recommend it."
