"Escape room ""Mission I"" by Escape Scene in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/escape-scene-everett-mission-1,0,"I have done three escape rooms prior to this and was highly impressed with this one. The owners really paid attention to detail both in the room and the whole experience in general. The place was super clean and I enjoyed the idea of a Time Travel Agency. We did the Old West themed room with two people who it was there first time. I really enjoyed it and blew my expectations away how close they stuck to the theme and how details they were with the locks, props, etc. Would definitely recommend and hope to be back again for another room."

I've done 5 escape rooms before these, and the Deadwood room is my all-time favorite so far. Great attention to detail, clever puzzles, great payoff, clean, well-organized, really well executed! We did Deadwood and Cairo with just two people and managed to escape both times...with less than a minute to spare. I can't wait for the WWII escape room to be ready!"

They offer free water!!! The room was interesting and spooky. I would recommend going. Staff was helpful with the clues to make them useful but still let us figure out the puzzles."
