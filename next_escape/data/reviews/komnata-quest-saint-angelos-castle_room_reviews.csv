"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,0,Komnata Quest is the best escape room game in NYC. The level of technology and unique games separates them from the competition. I played The castle first and fall in love with this kind of  games. I went to play many other games in NYC but could not find better the Komnata Quest . Now they have 6 different games open in two locations and building another 6 games and more locations is going to open in September... i can not wait...highly recommended.
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,1,"What an awesome and exciting way to spend an hour with your friends. We've tried several of the ""Escape The Room"" rooms, and while those were also very interesting and engaging I felt that Komnata Quest was much cooler.  The atmosphere of the room, the lighting, the music- all of it adds so much more to the entire experience. We did Saint Angelo's Castle and you actually feel like you've been locked in a medieval dungeon, kind of motivates you even more to escape from it.  Clues aren't easy to figure out but are totally doable if you think outside the box. If you get stuck the game master might offer some help over the speaker to help you move along to the next clue. Won't divulge anything more, just go and check it out for yourself. Great to go with friends or with co-workers as a team-building  exercise."
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,2,"Had a fun, challenging time playing Saint Angelo's Castle. Was definitely thrilling and challenging to try and piece the clues together and get out of the room in 60 minutes. Fun afternoon for me and my 2 girlfriends. We made it out in 54 minutes. Can you beat our time? hope you're not afraid of the dark! Think outside of the box, be creative, and work together.  Have fun!"
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,3,"Komnata Quest NYC is one of the best escape games I have ever played. As a previous manager for a similar escape game I must say this is top notch and stands above the rest! You are immediately captivated by the set as your adrenaline rushes through your body. The story line, set design and clues are very well thought out. Absolutely clever and keeps you on the edge of your seat till the very end. We never wanted the game to end! I would recommend this game to anyone who loves solving mysteries, escape rooms, puzzles or any sort of mystery quest. You won't be disappointed. If you need an event to bond with friends, family or team building look no more! This is just what the doctor ordered. This game reminded me of Sleep No More meets Escape The Room. Brilliant indeed. I can't wait to go back and see all of the new rooms they are planning for the fall. If I could, I would give this game 100 stars!!! I can only imagine the game getting better as time progresses. So glad NYC has something new and exciting to offer us all. Spine tingling and thrilling entertainment."
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,4,So if you want to do something completely different than normal I highly recommend this place to everyone! Using your mind to escape a room is very odd when you hear it because it's not something you would picture yourself doing! The whole experience was awesome!!! I can't wait for more rooms to open up!
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,5,"WOW! This the best quest I've been so far! If you are active, smart and like challenge this game is for you! The atmosphere of the room, story and props - all make it really great. I hope there will be more quest rooms open soon, can't wait  try to  escape again!Will recommend it to my friends! Good job!"
"Escape room ""Saint Angelo's Castle"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-saint-angelos-castle,6,"As a veteran of room escapes, I can say that this is the greatest introductory escape room we've ever done, and the best production out of all of them so far.The room was a little easy for our experienced team, as we got out in a little over 30 minutes, but for people who have never done one before, this is the one that will get you hooked. Phenomenal atmosphere, great presentation, and they make you put on druid costumes and carry around fake candles. What is not to like?"
