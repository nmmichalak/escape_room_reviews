"Escape room ""Ralph Breaks VR"" by The Void Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-void-orlando-ralph-breaks-vr,0,"The void was such an awesome and unique experience, got the chance to try both Starwars  and wreck it ralph. By far the coolest virtual reality experience i ever have done. Didnt feel cheesy and weird like most, it  felt very real , made me excited for things to come in the future. Id most most defiantly recommend wreck it Ralph tho it felt flawless and so clean with the VR id easily give it 5 Stars as for Starwars id give maybe 3 and a half it felt much shorter with some  left to be desired, plus much more glitchy . Was worth it tho"
"Escape room ""Ralph Breaks VR"" by The Void Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-void-orlando-ralph-breaks-vr,1,"We decided to give VR a try since my kids are thrill seekers and hey, we're on Spring Break! Why not? Go big or go home! Located in Disney Springs across from Earl of Sandwich adjacent to World of Disney store. Reservations are recommended as there are only a number of spots. They do take walk ins but we chose to book online for Wreck It Ralph at 5:15pm on a Friday. We heard Ralph was better than StarWars so we went with it. Check in was easy, staff awesome. It isn't cheap at $29.95. a pop but it is what it is. Once we checked in we saw a tutorial and suited up! All four of us ready to rock. Oh and we picked our avatars. We were all together playing but we had individual scores so we weren't working together per say as a team. It is a trip! So much fun, wish it was longer! We all got a great photo afterwards and even got a short video clip emailed to us. Photo was $15 plus tax and a copy sent to email. Overall the experience was great and the kids had an absolute blast! Must be 10+. We got to keep our avatar card as well as a keepsake. Will definitely do again!"

What a wonderfully original concept! Employees were friendly and efficient & I would totally go back! My one issue is the cost: $35 for what ends up being 15 minutes of game play is steep. I also didn't appreciate being charged nearly $3 ""per ticket processing fee"" when I paid in store at the cash register. I hate these sneaky ads-on fees, it seems really dishonest not to just raise the price of the ticket so people know exactly how much it's going to cost."
