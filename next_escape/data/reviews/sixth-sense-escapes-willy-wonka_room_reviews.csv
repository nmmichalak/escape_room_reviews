"Escape room ""Willy Wonka"" by 6th SE6SE Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/sixth-sense-escapes-willy-wonka,0,My family and I went to 6thSe6se escapes this past week and did every escape room . And we passed each one !  It was fun and very enjoyable! The escape rooms where challenge but no so bad where we felt we had to give up .  The owners were nice and welcoming they even remembered us when we came back ! We will definitely be visiting age in the coming months.  This is definitely the best escape room Iâ€™ve been to!!

Not 1, but 2 jigsaw puzzles (seriously, why pay nearly 30$ to put together jigsaw puzzles on a timer). Nested locks throughout the experience (one box had 2 locks on it. You open the box and find 2 more locked boxes). Most of the rest of the room is various types of counting puzzles. This might be a fun experience for younger kids who enjoy counting and searching for the items to count, but for a group of adults it was really boring."
