"Escape room ""Abducted: Escape from the Madman"" by trap't Escape Room Adventures in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/trapt-escape-room-adventures-abducted-escape-from-the-madman,0,We loved it! It was both challenging and fun. The rooms are so cleverly designed and there is something for everyone to solve. Our group had 5 people and I think if we had more it would've been harder to solve. We got out of the Abduction Room with 38 seconds to spare! The staff was very helpful and informative. I highly recommend!
"Escape room ""Abducted: Escape from the Madman"" by trap't Escape Room Adventures in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/trapt-escape-room-adventures-abducted-escape-from-the-madman,1,Loved it! Way more challenging than I expected. Did the Madman escape and had a little less than 3 minutes to spare. Definitely coming back.
"Escape room ""Abducted: Escape from the Madman"" by trap't Escape Room Adventures in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/trapt-escape-room-adventures-abducted-escape-from-the-madman,2,It was the first one I've done. Went with 3 other couple friends for my birthday. We did the Abducted room. It was so much fun! Each of us contributed something unique and it was a really engaging experience. We ended up finishing with 9 minutes left and all of us felt giddy and amped up afterward. It felt like quite the accomplishment. We did have some hints - but our game master said we needed far fewer clues than most groups. I definitely want to go back and do the other rooms. I highly recommend!

The puzzles were challenging and SO much fun to piece together. I really liked that you could request clues if you needed them, and the owners would give you just the right amount of info to help you without giving anything away. The ""abduction"" rooms were very well put together: amazing settings with so much realistic detail and very cleverly crafted puzzles. The owner was great to work with and went out of his way to make sure we enjoyed the experience. Couldn't recommend this place more highly! A very unique and amazing thing to do with family or friends!"

We had a ball. A great family night of trying to escape the Madman. Not sure where the hour went. A fun night for family and friends. Highly recommend this adventure and we are looking forward to trying our second room very soon!
