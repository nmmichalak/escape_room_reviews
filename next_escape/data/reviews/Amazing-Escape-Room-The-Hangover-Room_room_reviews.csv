It was our first Escape Room experience. There was one point where a clue we revealed was in the wrong box...but we got 2 minutes added on. We made it out in 35 minutes, and were pretty excited about it. The staff was super nice, helpful, and seemed to like what they were doing. We'll be back for sure."
