"Escape room ""Mutant X"" by Think Escape Games in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/think-escape-games-the-laboratory,0,"My Family and I were looking for something fun to do one Sunday afternoon and we came across Think Escape Games. This place blew our minds, we had such a blast. Their were 5 of us in total with ages ranging from 7 to 62. The Study room was super fun and had everyone involved. We will be back for sure. The staff were really friendly and answered all our questions after the game. "

We had a blast. We did The Laboratory game. It was difficult however we used our brains and worked as a team we got out.This is a great place the people there were friendly. Highly recommend going and engaging your mind and working as a team on these games.I am looking for an Escape Game place where I live and will be going frequently.

This was our first time and what a BLAST! I couldn't have asked for a better team. Solving the trivias for ""The Laboratory"" was a bit tedious, but you were so engaged and eager to solve the mysteries in each room you forget about the complexity of the game. Thanks to all the staff of Think Escape Games for making my birthday celebration different, fascinating and fun! Looking forward to ""The Lounge"". So we shall see you soon"
