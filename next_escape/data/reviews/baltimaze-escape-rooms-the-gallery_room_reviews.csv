"Escape room ""The Gallery"" by Baltimaze Escape Rooms in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/baltimaze-escape-rooms-the-gallery,1,"Escaped from 'The Gallery' on Baltimaze's Opening Day! Our team of 10 had an awesome time working together to get out with just over a minute left. I was so impressed at the complexity of the puzzles that the Baltimaze team had put together. It truly was a fun and unique experience, I can't wait to get back and try one of their other rooms out! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area."
