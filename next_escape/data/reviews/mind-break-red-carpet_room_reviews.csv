"Escape room ""Red Carpet"" by MindBreak in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mind-break-red-carpet,1,This was our first escape room so we were not sure what to expect. We had so much fun! There were 6 of us and we barely escaped! The workers were gracious to us and gave us an extra clue or two! Will definitely return if we are in the area!
