The staff was very friendly and accomodating. My wife and I went for our anniversary with some friends and we had a great time.

Awesome experience, go check this place out. You will not be disappointed!"

We played the Clownatorium and had a great time! This is by far the best themed and atmospheric escape room I've been to. I'm looking forward to trying the Space Parody and also their upcoming room as well!

It was so much fun and was so incredibly detailed. I was worried that our party was too big at first, but there was so much to do that it seemed like everyone was doing something at all times. It was also a perfect blend of creepy and hilarious fun. I'm definitely excited to go try out more of their escape rooms soon! If you like pop culture references, make some time to notice the details!"
