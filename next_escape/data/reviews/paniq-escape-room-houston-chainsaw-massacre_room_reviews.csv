We had tons of fun and Red did a great job getting us started! We did the Chainsaw Massacre room and we escaped with 20 minutes to spare. We cannot wait to come back again and try another room!
"Escape room ""Chainsaw Massacre"" by PanIQ Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/paniq-escape-room-houston-chainsaw-massacre,1,We went to Paniq Room Houston and had a blast. Red (our host) explained what we were and were not allowed to do to solve the puzzle and we nailed it. We escaped from the chainsaw massacre with 18 minutes left—which was a much better than our photo finish in the Wild West escape room. Paniq is a lot of fun every time we come.
