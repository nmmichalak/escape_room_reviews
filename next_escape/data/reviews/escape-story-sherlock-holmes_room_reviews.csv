"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-sherlock-holmes,0,"Terrific!  As promised on other reviews, Dan was great (so was his assistant).  This was our first ever escape room as a family of six, with kids in the 9 - 17 range.  Each of us added to the ideas, clues, and puzzles.  The furniture in the Sherlock Holmes room is vintage and caught my eye, for sure! And I was able to recite my joke:  Says Watson, ""But Holmes, what ARE the middle letters of the alphabet?"" ""L M N O P, my dear Watson."" (Insert four kid groans here.) Our family plans to escape the Indiana Jones room next time!"

Visited a lot of them, not just across the United States, but also Canada and Europe. And this is hands down the best one I ever visited so far! Kudos to the designer, the mechanics and the design of the room are outstanding! Make sure Escape Story is on your list."
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-sherlock-holmes,2,One of the best Escape Rooms I've been to. Challenging and fun. Sherlock Holmes  was great - can't wait to go back and do the Area 51.

Me and my girlfriend were in the ""AREA 51"" room trying to escape using powers of observation, teamwork, code breaking and other deductive skills to make it out  in an hour. Wonderfully challenging, great collaboration and a lot of fun!  Highly recommended!!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-sherlock-holmes,4,Couldn't recommend this place more! I've been to others that did not do a good job explaining the rules and guiding you in the right direction. The rooms and overall themes are fantastic and so creative!!! The people working their are eager to help and make it an awesome experience. We got down to the wire and managed to escape! It's the perfect amount of challenging and fun. You won't be disappointed!üëåüèª

We went there last Saturday and tried the Sherlock  room. The difficulty is average/above average, I guess. Some hints are not very obvious, but you can get them after some team efforts :) At the end we escaped with a bunch of hints, but it was definitely fun! :)Looking forward to trying the second room here."
