"Escape room ""The Billionaire's Den"" by Escape Room Mystery Cherry Hill in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-room-mystery-cherry-hill-the-billionaires-den,0,Had a great time during the July private room special. Victoria was our room guide and she was great. The facility was clean and the staff was friendly. We love escape rooms and were very excited to try this new site. Hopefully they have more private room options in the future because we would love to come back and escape the other themes.

Solving the puzzles with close friends was super engaging, and the staff was so friendly and made sure we had a great time!! We can't wait to go back to complete the other three rooms together!!"
