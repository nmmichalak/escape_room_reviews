"Escape room ""Locked Up"" by Exithis in Mansfield",https://worldofescapes.com/mansfield/quests/exithis-locked-up,0,"The wife and I, with some of her workmates had a great time. Was tougher than I thought it was going to be, but with the clues we escaped! They have 3 rooms I think. We did the prison break one. Was fun!"

"Escape room ""Locked Up"" by Exithis in Mansfield",https://worldofescapes.com/mansfield/quests/exithis-locked-up,2,"My group had a lot of fun trying to escape from prison. I did an escape room before in Cincinnati, but I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as Exithis. The guys working there were great. Looking forward to going back and trying the Temple Ruins!"
