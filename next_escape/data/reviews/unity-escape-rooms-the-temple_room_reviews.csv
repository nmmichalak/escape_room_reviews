"Escape room ""The Temple"" by Unity Escape Rooms in Redlands",https://worldofescapes.com/redlands/quests/unity-escape-rooms-the-temple,0,"Unity Escape Rooms was an amazing experience. My group did the Temple and it was unique, challenging, fun, and most importantly, made us uphold a sense of ""unity."" You have to work together to successfully conquer the rooms challenges. We are so excited to try the ""Cabin in the Woods"" and ""Wizard"" rooms. The owners are very creative and obviously at the top of their game. I have done other escape rooms and this one is definitely exceptional. Well played UER!"
