"Escape room ""Edison Puzzle Labs"" by Edison Puzzle Labs LLC in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/edison-puzzle-labs,0,"Super fun! It was set up in my living room and I did it with three of my young adult friends. It was challenging and I enjoyed the theme of it. Not creepy at all, and you felt like you were a part of the time period of Edison. It was cool to see how even though it only happened in one room, there were some awesome surprises along the way. I would definitely recommend this to do for a party or even a staff team-building event day!"
