"Escape room ""The Ransom"" by Daytona Escape Room Experience in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/daytona-escape-room-the-ransom,0,"We did ""The Ransom"" with four other people and it was a good group. The game host was very helpful in explaining the concept and the ""rules,"" as none of us had ever done this before. We did get a couple of clues (you can get a maximum of three). We completed the room in a little over 41 minutes, not bad for a first time!There is a second escape room at this location, we can't wait to do that one, too!"

"Escape room ""The Ransom"" by Daytona Escape Room Experience in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/daytona-escape-room-the-ransom,2,The Ransom room was cleverly created for challenging yet manageable escape tasks. Our group of 8 loved every minute of it and are super happy we completed the escape with minutes to spare! We plan to go back and hopefully be successful at the Black Jewel room. You won't be disappointed in The Daytona Escape Room Experience!!!
