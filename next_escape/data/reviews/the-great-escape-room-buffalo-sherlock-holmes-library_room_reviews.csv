"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/the-great-escape-room-buffalo-sherlock-holmes-library,0,"My husband and I decided to check this out. This was our first time doing one of these. We completed the Library room in 57 minutes with the help of another couple. Although we didn't know the other couple when we began, we all worked together to escape. Fran was our guide and was super friendly! I certainly recommend this fun experience and am sure we will be back to try a different room!"

The staff here made extra arrangements for us to truly enjoy a friend's birthday, they went above and beyond. One of my favorite parts was Frank! He is a great employee and really helped us have a great experience. Thanks Frank, you are awesome! "
