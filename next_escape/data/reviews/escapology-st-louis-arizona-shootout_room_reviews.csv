Tyler, our guide, was terrific! We were given solid hints to move us along when needed, and we escaped! We REALLY liked the whiteboard to keep track of clues. Great locks, well lit, and all really clean! And the “extended room” was psychologically encouraging versus just feeling trapped."
"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology St. Peters in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escapology-st-louis-arizona-shootout,2,"We were a team of 4 (2 adults, 2 teens) that played the Arizona Shootout. The story line was good. The puzzles were tricky at times and the props worked with the game. Our host, David, was fun and energetic. Then there was the mysterious puzzle master, Zack, whom we never met. We simply asked for a clue on an intercom and one appeared on the screen. He kept us going though so he did good, too. All in all we had a great time doing this puzzle and will be back some day for the others. Having done many of these now, I am not giving it 5 stars since it was not as sophisticated as others we had been to. Each clue leads to a standard lock of some kind. This lacked the secret room, magnetic lock or other creative extras that a couple other rooms in the area offer. But not every room could be the best. Finally, this place is connected to Kokomo Joes. Combining this with rounds of laser tag, mini bowling and other games makes for a fun, and expensive, outing. It was one we were glad we did."
