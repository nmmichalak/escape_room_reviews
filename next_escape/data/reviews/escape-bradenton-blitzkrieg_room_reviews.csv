"Escape room ""Blitzkrieg"" by Escape Bradenton in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/escape-bradenton-blitzkrieg,0,I loved it! Blitzkrieg was a challenging room. We got out with 50 seconds to go with some help. I want to go back and try a different room!

We fancy ourselves as experienced escape room artists and really enjoyed our time. Without giving anything away, the Blitzkrieg room has some amazing electro-engineering and puzzles and nothing we have done yet compares. It's a challenging room and has a really great gameplay. We can't wait to do more of their rooms! Thanks guys!"

Great as a family of four adults. We didn't escape but the staff was very helpful. The intricacies to detail are a must in this game. Having had no experience in this, would recommend an easier mission for a first timer. Will be back for another adventure."

We had previously done Inheritance and this time we did Blitzkrieg. Although both rooms were challenging, we managed to escape both times with a little help from base camp. Highly recommend Escape Bradenton, especially for team building as you need to communicate and work together to accomplish the tasks."
