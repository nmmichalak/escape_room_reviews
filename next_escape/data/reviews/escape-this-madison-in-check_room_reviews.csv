Chris and Renee were so welcoming, the space was modern and clean, and the room was well thought out. My group of 4 did the In check room. It was tricky, unique, and kept us on our toes. We barely made it out with success and cannot wait to try another room out. I would recommend this business to any of my friends!"

It was perfectly challenging and the grown-ups did not overpower the kids' ideas. It was a great way to spend an afternoon with the kids and their friends.
