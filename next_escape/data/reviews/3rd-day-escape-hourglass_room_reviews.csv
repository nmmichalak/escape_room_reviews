Isaac was so accommodating with our booking time and our host Joe was super friendly and nice. Hourglass 2.0 was not too easy or hard, but the room was really interesting. We are going back to do Harvest Motel very, very soon!"

We went with our little family and we had a great time solving the puzzles and having fun with the kids.The story is nice, not scary and the puzzles are very original. So you can come with your kids and see them have fun helping you finding the clues. Jo was a very nice host and made us feel comfortable.We did it ! And we had a 'bonus' room to do that was very nice too.3rd Day Escape are a great team, always very friendly and funny ! Thanks to Jo and Isaac for welcoming us to this Hourglass and to The Harvest Motel.For sure, highly recommended !!"
"Escape room ""Hourglass 2.0"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-hourglass,2,This was our first escape experience and it was a phenomenal first experience. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. They took care to reassure our 10 year old that it wasn't going to be too scary. The game itself is well laid out with a good balance of challenges. It was a great time and we look forward to trying other games from 3rd Day Escape.
