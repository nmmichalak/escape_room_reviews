Looking for something to do while it rained, we landed on this. We did the Travel Room as our first-ever escape room! This was a great puzzle for our group, and we had a blast!

My buddy and I spontaneously decided to do the Travel Room on a whim. Lots of little things to touch and play with, and a lot of the clues were very creative. Our GM was ridiculously fun to talk to, and the hints she gave us were clever and fun. We had a ton of fun!"
