"Escape room ""Moonshine Hootenanny"" by Gatlin's Escape Games in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/gatlins-escape-games-big-maw-bertha,0,"My wife and I had never done an escape room before, and we both enjoyed the Hootenanny experience. Our host kept it light and entertaining, and provided the right hints and clues to help us win. Experienced escape artists might find this one too easy, but for us it was just right! Highly recommended for a fun hour while in Gatlinburg."
