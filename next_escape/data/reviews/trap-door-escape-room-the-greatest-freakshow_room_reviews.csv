"Escape room ""The Greatest Freakshow"" by Trap Door Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/trap-door-escape-room-the-greatest-freakshow,0,"The best escape room in New Jersey for sure, we actually ended up driving 3 hours to come up here. We did the Freakshow room and escaped successfully. Thaddeus was a great game host! We ended up doing it with another group of people but it was still a lot of fun. I would definitely recommend coming here and doing their rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Greatest Freakshow"" by Trap Door Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/trap-door-escape-room-the-greatest-freakshow,1,Just played The Greatest Freakshow today. The game was awesome. They did very well capturing the feeling of being at a carnival. It was hard but we managed to get out with about 15 minutes left. If you like escape rooms or just want a fun thing to do with the family I would definitely play this game.
