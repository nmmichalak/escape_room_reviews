"Escape room ""Aliens"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-aliens,0,This room is on the easy side so great for players new to escape rooms. The room was nicely themed and nice story progression. This is a traditional lock-style puzzle room. The staff was great and very flexible with the booking process. A bonus with this room is that they let you take a team photo inside the room with a special prop. Makes for a great photo.

The neighborhood was a little more run down than I expected and the building looked very small but once inside, the fun began!! We can't wait to get back and try all of the other rooms!!

"Escape room ""Aliens"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-aliens,6,"I've played a few of these rooms in different cities and PanIQ Room is right up there with the best. Challenging, yet achievable, with a flow that matches the puzzles with the scenario. There is a lot of thought put in to the play/stump balance.Our hosts, Chan and Jeff, are my kind of people. They're the right blend of helpful, friendly and smart-ass. The after action talk is as fun as the room. We'll be back soon."

We did the alien room with our family, two adults and four kids. It was such a blast! My daughter was really nervous beforehand about being locked in a room and her ability to contribute. She had the best time! The clues are great and so varied that everyone will be able to add something. Loved loved loved it! We will be back soon to be kidnapped!"
