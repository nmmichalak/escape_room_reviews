"Escape room ""The 13th Floor"" by Escape Dothan in Dothan",https://worldofescapes.com/dothan/quests/escape-dothan-the-13th-floor,1,My boyfriend and I went here for a date night last weekend and we LOVED it! We did the 13th floor but were ultimately unable to escape. Ethan was the one working that night and was exceptionally kind and explained everything very thoroughly after we lost. We will definitely be back!

"Escape room ""The 13th Floor"" by Escape Dothan in Dothan",https://worldofescapes.com/dothan/quests/escape-dothan-the-13th-floor,4,My husband and I went in today to do the 13th Floor room. We loved it so much that we stayed and did Time Warp right after (there was an open slot). We have done multiple escape rooms in both Hawaii and Mississippi. Escape Dothan is by far the best one we have been to so far. The people that work the rooms allow you to struggle some before they give you hints. They don't make it too easy to get out! We plan on returning in the near future to do Murder at the Mansion and will continue to go as new rooms are opened. We highly recommend that everyone try Escape Dothan!
