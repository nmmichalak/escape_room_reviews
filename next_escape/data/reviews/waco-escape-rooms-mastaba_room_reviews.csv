"Escape room ""Mastaba"" by Waco Escape Rooms in Waco",https://worldofescapes.com/waco/quests/waco-escape-rooms-mastaba,0,"I just recently tried mastaba.  It was so eerily detailed and the atmosphere made it a ton of fun!  My group and I really enjoyed the puzzles and the horror-y feel to them.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful,  giving us just the clues we needed to push forward through the room and eventually escape.  I thouroughly enjoyed myself and am eager to try some of the other rooms.  I will most certainly be back and highly recommend checking it out if you're killing to spend an enjoyable hour doing something different."

Waco Escape Rooms had a great location, clean rooms, and helpful service. We tried Mastaba, and this was our first time. Although we didn't get out, we had a great time, with a great host (Armon). The experience was immersive and affordable."
