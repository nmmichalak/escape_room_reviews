"Escape room ""The Hustler"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-hustler,0,"Just did the Hustler room with some friends and we had a blast. Great room, excellent puzzle flow with lots to do for large groups, which can be hard to find. Also, our game master Liz was incredible. She gave the single best post game debrief I've ever had, ensuring we all really understood everything that went on since there were many things happening in different places all at once. As an enthusiast, I really appreciated understanding exactly what piece of the ""puzzle"" I contributed to. Very cool! Can't wait to go back and check their other rooms out!"
"Escape room ""The Hustler"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-hustler,1,"It was a blast. Did ""The Hustler"". Little overwhelming at first. I got separated from my friends which was probably for the best. Ended up in a room with people that had done a different escape room before so followed their lead. Met up with friends soon enough. Great fun for a hour and we got out with 4 minutes to spare. Would do it again."

Staff were courteous and quickly responsive to our requests for hints. The rooms were well constructed and the puzzles were clever but not impossible to figure out.We ended up solving the room with about 8 minutes to spare, but I could see myself enjoying the experience even if I'd met my untimely end in the basement of a Chinese dumpling restaurant.I can't wait to go again and try the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Hustler"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-hustler,3,It was great but quite challenging! Escaped with a few seconds left on the clock. Fun idea for a birthday party like ours or just a family outing.

As an ice-breaker it was great! The separation actually is great for communicating and teamworking. Definitely recommend this room, one of the best I've ever done."
