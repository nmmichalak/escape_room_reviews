We loved the spy theme and immediately got into our roles as mystery solvers! Everyone in our group (6 of us - all ages) had a great time, and we solved our room in the perfect amount of time with no clues. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys fun, group activities!"
"Escape room ""Eye Spy"" by Panic Room CDA in Coeur d'Alene",https://worldofescapes.com/coeur-d-alene/quests/panic-room-cda-eye-spy,2,My boyfriend and I had a blast in the EyeSpy room this past week! Definitely challenging but you are allowed up to 3 hints if/when you get stuck. The staff was very friendly and professional and it was easy to book our appt online. Would recommend on a rainy day or when you need a break from the sun!
