Both Chainsaw Bob and Amnesia rooms were amazing. Kids had so much fun, I am looking forward to doing an adult night out in the near future there. This place is a definite must see!"

We first did the Chainsaw Bob room and we won! It was great for bonding and working together as a team! We all loved it so much we got the group back together and did the second room equally just as challenging. The group we went with all had a blast and the staff was amazing, friendly, and fun we really enjoyed our time."

That was the first time I'd ever tried one of these so I had no idea what to expect or how to compare it to others, but I've since been back to do Room Amnesia and I've also tried escape rooms at two other places - and the two I did here (QQuest in Pompano) were by far the best.I just learned about the new location and new storyline (The Laboratory), so I got tix for me and my boyfriend to check out later this week. We can't wait!"

Man was this hard, in the beginning they tell you only 10% of people make it in time. But we all thought, cmon how is that possible?! lol it's possible. The staff was super cool though and we got a little extra time to escape ourselves. The puzzles were all well thought of and the room was well decorated. The whole vibe from when you walk into their establishment is nothing short of DOPE.Loved it!!!"
