"Escape room ""Rescue Pikachu"" by ASDF Escape in New Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/new-brunswick/quests/asdf-escape-rescue-pikachu,1,We did the Pikachu room with 7 people. Puzzles were generally good and only a couple of things were semi-arbitrary. We finished relatively quickly. Main complaints are that the atmosphere was disappointing and there should have been a max of 4 people in the room. I have also been to a much better escape room in DC.

Thy did a good job putting together the room and clues but it wasnâ€™t exactly professional looking - more like the upstairs of an old residential building with small rooms.

It was a little harder than I thought it would be. If not for my 11-year-old daughter, I wouldn't have even known where to begin, lol!"
