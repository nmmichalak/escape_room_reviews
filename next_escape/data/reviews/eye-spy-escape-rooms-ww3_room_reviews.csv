We had a group of 4 married couples and we all had a blast! We couldn't stop talking about it and we are excited to go back. It was a new experience for our whole group. We did the WW3 conspiracy room and it was very engaging for everyone and it is a great team building event.

Not only the room but the owner as well. We did the WW3 and figured it out 10 seconds too late. The most fun I've had in a while!"
