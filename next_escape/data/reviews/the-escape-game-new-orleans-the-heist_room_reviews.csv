"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-the-heist,1,"My family had a great time at the escape game. We did ""The Heist"" and completed it with 19 seconds left on the timer. It was challenging and fun at the same time. The staff was very pleasent and helpful. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great time."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-the-heist,2,Our group did the heist! It was very fun and made us use our heads. I would say not to bring toooo many people bc the rooms are kind of small. And you want to get in the know with all the clues easier. Cedes was our game master and she was awesome!

I don't know if escape games have died out or if anyone still does them, but this place about to make escape games a HUGE comeback! This place is located on Peters Road downtown. Parking sucks. You either pay for parking across the street(convenient) or find free street parking as long as it's after 7. A friend of mine saw a deal for 50% off escape room bookings, so she booked the crew and I for the Heist experience. I honestly did not know what to expect from the escape room. It's been like.. 4 years since I did one? I couldn't recall how my experience was during that time, but I'm sure I had a good time. However, it's been so long, I don't know how escape rooms have evolved overtime. Right off the bad, the place inside looks nice. Bookings are made easy and staff is very friendly and eager to help you through your time there. Our guy Bryant took us to our room and explained how everything worked and showed us the video. SUPER kind guy by the way! I had questions, HE had the answers! I won't get into too much about my Heist Experience escape game, but just know I had a frickin BLAST! Bryant says he personally finds the Heist the best, and I could see why! These puzzles are moderately challenging for the group of 6 I came with. The best part about the game was that as you find and unlock clues, the way the next clue is exposed just makes you scream ""WHOAAAAAAAA!!"" Like, literally every time we found or unlocked a clue, it would just expose itself in the most surprising ways! Wish I could explain in detail how much fun I had, but I wouldn't want to reveal the details of how or what we saw, you'll have to book the room with some friends yourselves!This place was DEFINITELY worth it, and for 50% off and our bookings were about $18 a person, it was a STEAL! I'd highly recommend this place for either just 2 of you, or even up to 8! Consider a max of 6, as the rooms may get a little cluttered if you have any more than that. Overall, I haven't had that much fun like that in a while. Check them out!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-the-heist,4,"The Escape Game company is BY FAR the best escape room company we've experienced. Our first ones were in Pigeon Forge and we've completed others in Houston and New Orleans. They are the reason we became hooked to escape rooms in the first place. We've completed more than 30 rooms and these are still the best. So glad that they have made it to New Orleans!!These are perfect for first timers and experienced players. First timers, start out with the lower difficulty rooms first and work your way up.You won't regret trying these! Good luck y'all!"
