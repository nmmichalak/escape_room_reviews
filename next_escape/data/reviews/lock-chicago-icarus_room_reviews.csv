"Escape room ""Icarus"" by Lock Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/lock-chicago-icarus,2,"Location: Lock Chicago has moved from Davis street to Green Bay road, both within Evanston. I do like this location much better as it is more spacious and there is more parking available. There are also several restaurants and fun shops in the area, so you should make a day out of it.Condition: We were a group of 6 people and booked a private room. It was the newest room and everything was in a good and clean condition.Staff: From the very beginning, the communication with the business from booking, to re-booking, to re-booking again has been friendly and efficient. Everybody working here is nice and happy to help.Summary: This specific room Icarus was very involved and I am glad there were 6 of us versus, let's say, just 4. Sadly we did not succeed, but that did not discouraged us from going to another room some another time. We had lots of fun and the hour went by very quickly."
