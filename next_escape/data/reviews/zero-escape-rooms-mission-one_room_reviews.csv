"Escape room ""Mission I: The Abstrusus"" by Zero Escape Rooms in Great Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/great-falls/quests/zero-escape-rooms-mission-one,1,"The owner is friendly and passionate about the business. The Abstrusus Museum Room is interesting and thoughtfully developed. This is a great family activity that requires working together as a team. If you're on a tight budget, this might seem expensive. I think it's worth every penny."
