"Escape room ""The Vault"" by Unchained STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/unchained-stl-the-vault,0,"Just finished our first escape at this location - we will be back!!! Clean, professional, no nonsense puzzles. Loved it! Lindsay was a great hostess - responsive and fun. There was enough for everyone to do so no one was standing around. Good story; great props. Can't wait to bring my girls scouts here for their detective badge."
