"Escape room ""Secret Agent"" by iPanic Escape Room in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/ipanic-escape-room-secret-agent,1,My boyfriend and I decided to try a 20 minute room tonight and loved every second of it! We chose the spy challenge & it was a blast. David (I hope that’s right!) at the front desk was a delight and made the experience even better than we expected. We will definitely be back with our friends for a 60 minute room soon!!

It was super fun! The guy working at the desk (wish we got his name!!) was SUPER helpful and made it a fun experience. His energy was great! We can’t wait to go back and try another room 😁"
