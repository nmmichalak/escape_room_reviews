"Escape room ""The Bat Cave Conundrum"" by House of Conundrum in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/house-of-conundrum-the-bat-cave-conundrum,0,Had such a great time doing the Batman room with the family. There were 8 of us ranging in age from 5 to adult and we all had fun! It was just challenging enough to be fun. Highly recommend! A very fun stop on our family vacation!
"Escape room ""The Bat Cave Conundrum"" by House of Conundrum in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/house-of-conundrum-the-bat-cave-conundrum,1,Took our 11-year-old daughter who loves superheroes and comics and a couple friends for her birthday to do the BatCave room and had a blast! None of us had ever done an escape room before and this one was both challenging and fun! The kids figured out some stuff we didn't and we figured out some stuff they didn't... great for everyone! The staff was great also and i can't wait to go back and try a few more of the rooms!
