We’ve gone to several escape rooms around the Dallas area and this was the best. Anna helped us and she was wonderful! She was so sweet and fun to work with. Thanks, Anna! We plan to return to try other rooms and will request to have her be our host again. The room was elaborate and had some great surprises. Thanks for a fun experience:) "

This is by far my favorite room!!!  It brings you so much joy, things constantly surprise you, it is never scary, and things are executed so well.  It is great for new timers and for experienced escapees.  This company does everything right!!!!"

Once you get inside, it’s an awesome experience from start to finish. We did the Playground escape room with a group of 9 people, including 6 adults and 3 kids. We’ve done many escape rooms and this was one of our favorites! There were so many puzzles and things to figure out that everyone had something to work on. No one was ever bored! The room requires a lot of teamwork and communication. It was great for a large group like ours. The school/playground theme is very well represented and was exciting for the adults and kids. There are lots of really fun surprises! We highly recommend this room."

We had a great time escaping tonight. We had a group of 9, 4 adults, 3 teens and 2 preteens. The playground room was perfect for us. We escaped with 45 seconds to spare. The staff was so nice and the room was clean and well organized. We will go back when we are in the Dallas area again."
"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-escape-game-dallas-playground,4,Had a great time with my team at Playground. This was my second team building event with The Escape Game Dallas. I would highly recommend to anyone. This would make a great date night with another couple. For those that feel claustrophobic this particular room is their largest. My biggest tip is pay attention because sometimes the easier answer is the right one.

This is the latest and greatest of their 4 games and after playing all of them, I honestly can't choose my favorite. They are all so intricate and amazing and gets my adrenaline pumping every time. Looking forward to the next!! There really is no comparison! The experience was ultimate from the beginning to the end and I highly recommend for families, work groups, fun date nights, excitement for all!"
