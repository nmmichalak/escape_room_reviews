"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-cuban-crisis,0,"Came today with a group of 5 and did the Cuban middle crisis puzzle. Very challenging and creative with hidden doors and safes. Lots of puzzles, we were able to solve with 3 minutes to spare. A little pricey but worth it."

This place is awesome and the staff was very friendly. We loved getting out of the first room so much we did a second room the same night. I highly recommend this place.
