"Escape room ""Lost Jewel of Zanzibar"" by Escape Room Center in Bridgewater",https://worldofescapes.com/bridgewater/quests/escape-room-center-lost-jewel-of-zanzibar,0,Excellent location. By far one of the best escape rooms I have done in NJ. Kelly was super helpful without giving away too much. Just a few kinks with the typewriter in the Zanzibar room and the outside noise level from the waiting area kept me from giving it five stars. Would still go again for sure.
