"Escape room ""Archaeologist's Adventure"" by Cville Escape Room in Charlottesville",https://worldofescapes.com/charlottesville/quests/cville-escape-room-archaeologists-adventure,1,"This was the first escape room game for me and we chose the Archaeology room. It took a few minutes to figure out how it all works as there were about a dozen lock boxes, lots of paintings and a radio playing oldies from the forties. However, once we got started we rolled well using the clues which took us to another room. Itâ€™s well worth the ticket and make sure you bring 4-5 people with you. The lady in charge was nice and friendly. We are definitely going back."
