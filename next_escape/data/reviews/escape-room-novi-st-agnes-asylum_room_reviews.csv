"Escape room ""St. Agnes Asylum"" by Escape Room Novi in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-novi-st-agnes-asylum,0,"My coworkers and I went there the other night and unfortunately, some of the props didn't work correctly. We did the Asylum room and did not have the best experience due to the malfunctioning. The staff was able to help us escape, but it would have been better if we could have gone through the clues ourselves."

And no I didn't make it out... but the electrodes are not hurting so much today. Anyway, it was fun creepy, and ""insanely"" challenging. Thanks also to our guide Carson. He allowed me to post this. I'm still strapped to the slab..."

We did the Asylum and it was really challenging. The only criticism, there was a moment when we solved a clue that triggered a voice which gave another clue, but we couldn't hear it (nor did we realize it was a clue) because the music was REALLY loud. We probably would have solved it in time if we would have heard the voice and the music wasn't so intense. Other than that, it was awesome. Great puzzles and fun!"

The Asylum is hard, indeed, but do-able. If we hadn't gotten stuck on one of the puzzles and then missed the first part of the clue because we didn't realize we'd finally done it right, we'd have made it out.Highly recommended (though the Asylum is definitely for a more mature audience)."

We did asylum, and it was the most challenging they offered. We beat it with 7 minutes to spare and only used two clues. Such a great atmosphere and the staff was pretty awesome as well."

Me, my Dad, my daughter, my Wife, and two of my besties went. We chose the ""insanely hard"" asylum room. We only took 1 out of three clues and made it out with 3 minutes 25 seconds to spare!! Had a great time!"
