We had two families experience the escape room today. Fantastic. We returned after Saving the White House last year. Glad to have experienced both rooms at Escape House. Agent Dark Heart was exceptional. Great with our kids and a lot of fun.

We found this adventure challenging and fun. It required critical thought, teamwork and clear communication. The staff was accommodating and accessible. Agent Dark Heart was particularly good to work with and helpful in the journey. We would highly recommend the experience and plan on returning to attempt a new adventure and are looking forward to the opening of Safe House restaurant in February.Thanks EscapeHouse Chicago! We had a blast."

The Agent room was a fantastic companion through the 60-minute adventure. It was very fun and just challenging enough to scratch our heads. We finished with 4 minutes left on the clock and 2 clues used. We were definitely feeling the pressure! Thank you so much for the great experience!
