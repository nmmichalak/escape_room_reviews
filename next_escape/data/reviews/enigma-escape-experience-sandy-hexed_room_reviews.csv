"Escape room ""Hexed"" by Enigma Escape Experience in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/enigma-escape-experience-sandy-hexed,0,"My family and I loved it!!! We are visiting Utah from California this week but the ski season does not officially open until Wednesday so we searched other things to do for Monday and Tuesday. Soooo glad we found Enigma Escape Experience. Tom was able to accommodate a same day appointment, we were welcomed when walking in, we received instructions and away we went. We did the hexed room and it was only my husband, my 13 year old, my six year old, and I. It was such a great way to spend time together and it sure stimulated our thinking skills Its great for all ages. I would recommend this place to anyone trying to have some fun, likes challenges, and likes to work as a group."

I didn't know quite what to expect, as this was my first escape room experience. The storyline that went along with the 'Hexed' room was super creative and interesting, and I thought the clues, props, and overall setup were super well done. The whole experience had a kind of an Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark vibe to it, which I loved! My group and I had a blast, and I can't wait for their next room. Oh, and Tom was an awesome host. Very personable and fun. Highly recommend!"
