"Escape room ""The Pyramid"" by Room X Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/room-x-escape-the-pyramid,0,"Had a great time in the mummy room yesterday. The owner is super nice and the game was challenging but fun. Probably wouldn’t have made it out without the 6 other guys that were with us, but that’s okay! We’ll definitely be going back to try the treasure and castle rooms!"

It was a multi-room adventure that forces you to really work as a team to gather all the clues and see how they connect. Plus, there were more than a few really cool surprises throughout. Very memorable!"
