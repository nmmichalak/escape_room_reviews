"Escape room ""The Basement"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-basement-chicago,0,This place was so much fun!! It's kinda like the movie saw where you have riddles and have to figure it out to get out. But you only have an hour to go through the two rooms. Super hard but awesome!! So worth the 30 a person!

It was a blast! Very glad I finally was able to experience a room escape, and the tight theme made it all the better! Awesome job, and our gamemaster, whose name escapes me, did a great job answering our questions. Very fun. I will be back to try the other room!"

They also had the nicest staff members which made the experience that much more enjoyable!My friends and I did The Basement with two strangers, and found it easy to all work together. We nearly made it out, but didn't in the end. Oh, well, next time!Our guide was awesome at steering us in the right direction when we had issues with the clues and riddles, and easing my worries about the room being too scary (it wasn't, don't worry!).Loved everything, and will definitely go again"
"Escape room ""The Basement"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-basement-chicago,5,"SO FUN!  Did a team building exercise here for work today, and it was awesome!Wish I could say we were one of the 10% that gets out in an hour, but no such luck... it wasn't as easy as we'd hoped, nor as difficult as I feared... but tough.  We did the basement, and were thankful that they keep a 'guide' with you.  They don't really help, but they do try to steer you toward a clue, if you don't realize you're on to it.  Keys?  Don't over think it.  Listen to each other.Would we do it again?  Yes!  In a heartbeat!"
"Escape room ""The Basement"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-basement-chicago,6,"Absolutely great time! We did the HH Holmes basement rooms! The 8 of us has to work as a team to solve puzzles and riddles to get codes to unlock the locks or find keys.  It was great.  The staff are friendly, entertaining, educational and fun.  You have 60 minutes to break free from the room.  Or room actually had two rooms to escape.  They say only 12% are able to escape but most that don't are very close.  We finished with just under 11 minutes to spare! It was a team effort and was a lot of fun.  Be sure to speak up and work together.  No suggestion is a bad suggestion.  Highly recommend!"
