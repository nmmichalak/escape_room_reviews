"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/the-escape-game-houston-prison-break,0,"We played the Prison Break and it was complete fun. I want to go back to do the other ones. Great option for birthday celebrations, team buildings and just friends get together!"
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/the-escape-game-houston-prison-break,1,Went here with my three friends and they teamed us up with two more strangers. I'm so glad they did because the more people the better! We did Prison Break theme (the hardest) and escaped with 22 seconds left! It was so much fun. The instructor makes it really clear at the beginning as well as hints are available throughout the game if you get stuck. It takes a lot of brain power but isn't impossible because we did it! I recommend this for anyone and I definitely want to go back to try other rooms!!!

We had 7 adults and did the Prison Break room.  We were soooo close to getting out in time. This is my 5th escape room and it was a lot of fun and with lots of surprises!  The employees were a lot of fun also.  We will definitely be back.

From our greeter to our guide (Tim) we had a wonderful experience. For galentines we decided to try and escape prison with ""prison break"". My favorite game so far. We will be back and try to escape ""gold rush"" next time."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/the-escape-game-houston-prison-break,4,This was my very first escape room and it was awesome! It might be my favorite. Lots of challenging aspects of it.  I have done it twice so far as the first time we didn't escape prison.  Lots of communication is required!! Super fun and definitely something fun to do with family or coworkers. They do a great job here!
