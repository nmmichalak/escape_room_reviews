"Escape room ""Dr. Guts"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-dr-guts,0,"After doing the third room at Xterious one of the staff suggested Dr. Guts. We made time for it and are sure glad we did. One of the smoothest rooms I have ever been in, great staff, great puzzles, great back story video to get you started. Woohoo we made the leader board! One clue"

Kaiden was so helpful throughout the ordeal and he had a blast with us! If you're looking for a fun birthday activity with friends, come here for a fun day! I recommend Dr. Guts"
"Escape room ""Dr. Guts"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-dr-guts,2,"We were in Vegas for our daughter’s 21st birthday and wanted to try something new and fun, so we googled escape rooms and called AmeriEscape and talked to Peter, who gave us a great deal on a late afternoon Saturday time slot. When we arrived, Ben was our host and he took great care of us. There were seven in our group, and we had the BEST time in the “Dr. Guts” escape room(s). It was challenging but not impossible – it had well thought-out clues and props – you could tell they must have put 100s of hours into the design of Dr. Guts. Next time we are in Vegas, we are definitely going back and trying their Egyptian “tomb raider” escape room. Thanks again to Peter and Ben for an awesome experience!"
