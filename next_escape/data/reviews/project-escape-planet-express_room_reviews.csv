"Escape room ""Planet Express"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-planet-express,0,"Project: Escape has quality games and friendly, accommodating staff! We’ve only escaped one of the three games in time, but look forward to visiting the other two in the future.If you’re in the Marietta+ area, you owe it to yourself to get a group of family or friends together to solve one of these fun adventures. Great for holiday get togethers, team building or just a fun visit with friends. The new Planet Express is top notch and now my current favorite (because it’s the only one we’ve beat!)."

Project Escape is tons of fun and the escape rooms are great.Tonight was our second trip there and once again, it did not disappoint. Escaped the new room, Planet Express - tons of fun. Did the Vault 2nd and unfortunately, did not escape in time.We will be going back again and again to hopefully conquer the other rooms.The staff is super awesome and super friendly.Definitely a 5 star experience!"
