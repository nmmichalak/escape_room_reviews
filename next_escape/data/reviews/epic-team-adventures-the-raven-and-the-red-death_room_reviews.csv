"Escape room ""The Raven and the Red Death"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-raven-and-the-red-death,0,"This was actually my first Escape Room experience, but I've participated in similar events where I work for years. I got to playtest their new scenario ""The Raven and the Red Death"" which was a lot of fun. There were a few minor hitches in just a couple of puzzles (which they are planning to address based on playtest feedback). Other than that, the puzzle execution was great, the props in the room were of excellent build and they've made good use of tech to expand how big the puzzle space feels (being able to move between rooms to gain access to additional clues/puzzles). I definitely would recommend my experience to anyone looking to have a good time with an average sized group of friends."
"Escape room ""The Raven and the Red Death"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-raven-and-the-red-death,1,"I've done three different rooms at Epic Team Adventures and they're all fantastic, some of the best I've done anywhere, and I've done escape rooms all over the US. Good storyline, fantastic props and theming, clean, consistent puzzles, and really nice use of tech to make things work automatically. It's hard to rank rooms which are really different but Raven and the Red Death is definitely in the top 3 that I've done. Highly recommended."
"Escape room ""The Raven and the Red Death"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-raven-and-the-red-death,2,"We went to ETA for my husband's birthday. We had a blast! I was worried the puzzles were going to be hard and I would feel like I do watching Jeopardy. That was not the case. Matt, one of the ETA staff, was there to give us assistance if we really got stuck. We did use him a couple of times, but still felt a great sense of accomplishment when we solved the last puzzle. This is something everyone should try at least once, but don't blame me if you get hooked. I am definitely going back to do one of the other rooms."
