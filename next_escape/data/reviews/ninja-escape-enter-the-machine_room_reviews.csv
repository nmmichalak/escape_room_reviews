"Escape room ""Enter the Machine"" by Ninja Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/ninja-escape-enter-the-machine,0,"Enter The Machine in Fremont was really fun! It was our first escape room game ever, and five of us friends beat the room just BARELY in time. Definitely stressful, lots of brain required, and great for working with others. The staff was enthusiastic and kind. Highly recommended!"

It was a blast and I would recommend this escape room if anyone asks me. The challenge was good and the room was well designed. I and my team finished it with only minutes to go.

We had the time of our lives! The puzzles were just the right level of difficulty. We barely escaped with our lives! I can confidently recommend ninja escape if you like puzzles. I'll definitely be back!"
