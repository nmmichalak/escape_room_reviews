We tried the Inventor's Garage as a group of six. The puzzles were really fun and creative. The staff was super friendly, well organized, and accommodating. Can't wait to go back and try the other 3 rooms! Highly recommended."

So far we've done The Inventor's Garage, Sweet Dreams and the Lost Continent, all with a different mix of people. I'm thoroughly impressed with the thoughtful design of each of the rooms and all of the puzzles are unique. The decorations in the room match the story lines perfectly. I've met both owners now and they're equally friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the escape room experience and Epic Escape Game in particular."
"Escape room ""The Inventor's Garage"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-the-inventors-garage,3,This place is great! I had never done an escape room before and my sister suggested we do it for our dad's birthday the other day. We did the Inventor's Garage and got out within approximately 40 minutes. It was a great way to get those gears in our brains moving all while having fun. It was much more intricate of a set up than I thought it would be and I will definitely be going back.

Will be back to try the other rooms! Thanks for the great time!
