We did the Creepy Lair (rated as hard) with our group of 6 and a family of 3. We had a blast! The rooms were awesome, the clues varied from moderate to pretty difficult, yet they were logical.We made it out with about 2 min to spare, but we had to ask for 2 clues towards the end. The staff was awesome as well!"

Very friendly and helpful. Well worth the money and it made you think. I cannot wait to come back and do the Heist. If you have a group in St Louis, you need to do this!"
"Escape room ""Creepy Lair"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/Mastermind-Escape-Room-The-Creepy-Lair,3,HIGHLY recommend! The owners were extremely friendly and really made us feel at home from being out of town. Very fun and upbeat personalities. We almost had it solved! Staff was super encouraging! The puzzles weren't ridiculously hard but they weren't easy by any stretch either. The scene was done very tastefully yet felt authentic at the same time. Really had a blast doing this and would highly recommend to all! Well worth the 3 he trip and money!
