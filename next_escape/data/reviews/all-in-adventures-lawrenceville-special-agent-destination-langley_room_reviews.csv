"Escape room ""Special Agent - Destination Langley"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-special-agent-destination-langley,0,"Attempted the Special Agent Room last night with three friends. We weren't able to solve the puzzle in the 45 minute time frame, but it was a lot of fun trying. Apparently we picked the hardest room. It was really challenging and fun. The staff was very friendly and helpful in providing clues to our team. I recommend this as a great team building exercise for family, friends and coworkers. BTW, park at the Basspro. It is located across the hall."
