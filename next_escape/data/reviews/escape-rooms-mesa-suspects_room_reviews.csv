"Escape room ""Suspects"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-suspects,0,"I've been to this place twice and love it! I recently did suspects and boy was there a twist on that room, but also did bookie! Fantastic place and one of the best escape rooms that I've been to. Def worth the money and I highly recommend seeing if there is a groupon, then call and ask them for the same deal and they will give it to you! More money in their pockets and you still get a great deal. Jack was our control master and he had fun with us as well, sending celebratory messages on the screen when we would get the next clue unlocked. Can't wait to go back, already scheduled my next adventure 3/2... doing captains quarters :)"
