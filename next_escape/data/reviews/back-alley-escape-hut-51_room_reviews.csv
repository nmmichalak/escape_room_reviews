"Escape room ""Hut 51"" by Back Alley Escape in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/back-alley-escape-hut-51,1,What are you waiting for ??? Don't miss the opportunity to play Back Alleys Escape rooms. The owners Simon and Angie are helpful and so fun to interact with. It's a family run business with such a fun vibe. The two rooms that they have are very challenging and well thought out. I think they make there own rooms. A ton of detail and fun is packed into each room. The Hut was challenging but we got out in time with the help of our game master. The Basement was a 9/10 in level hardest. We could not get though it. We are doing it again and hope to escape the next time. We have played 20 escape rooms to date and consider this to be one of the most challenging. Highly recommend you play here. Also the have VR escape rooms. And they are fun as well. We enjoyed both of them and will go back again just to play. One last bonus is the laxer tag room. My children enjoyed themselves and it's a great idea to take the whole family for a afternoon of fun or even a birthday party.
