They have 5 different themes. We had to escape by finding Thomas Edison's patent which involved puzzles, locks, clues, hidden objects and movement between 2 rooms. 6 people per theme, so not crowded. Some clues are difficult - we were fortunate to escape right before time expired. Great fun, good for party or team building event."

The rooms are incredibly well decorated and so well thought out. After coming from only 1 experience at a different escape room I was blown away by the intensity and fun this was. The Edison Room is a MUST! Thank you for such a great time, we will most definitely be back!"
