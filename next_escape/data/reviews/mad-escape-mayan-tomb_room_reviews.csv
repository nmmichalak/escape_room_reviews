"Escape room ""Mayan Tomb"" by Mad Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mad-escape-mayan-tomb,0,"This was the best escape room we have been to. We have gone to them all over the country and this was the most realistic, everything worked properly and it was a real challenge. We did the Mayan but we definitely be back to try the rest!"

"Escape room ""Mayan Tomb"" by Mad Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mad-escape-mayan-tomb,2,What a great time this was!! The staff were really sweet and accommodating since the weather was iffy when we were scheduled to go. The room was really detailed! We escaped with 4 people in Mayan tomb in 35 minutes. We needed some clues from the staff but it was truly awesome! Highly recommend!
