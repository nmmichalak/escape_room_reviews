With just the two of us, we managed to beat it without using all the clues and still had 13 minutes left. Now addicted. Cannot recommend enough."

We did the room with 3 strangers and they were fun and smart. Just like us. Hahaha. 6 total and we got out in about 50 minutes. Wasn't too easy and wasn't too hard. Will go back in a few months and try the Heist room. Totally enjoyed this experience."

The staff was really welcoming and friendly. We escaped the Gold Rush with about a minute to spare. It was pretty challenging, but the boys loved it. They even gave the birthday boy a t-shirt when we escaped, which he was so thrilled about that he wore it to bed and wore it to school the next day! I will definitely recommend and I’m sure we’ll be back to try another room soon."
