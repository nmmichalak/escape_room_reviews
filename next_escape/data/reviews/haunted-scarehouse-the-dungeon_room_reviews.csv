"Escape room ""The Dungeon"" by 13th Hour Haunted House in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/haunted-scarehouse-the-dungeon,1,We did the Dungeon the other night and it was awesome! Completely different experience than my other escape rooms. What a pleasant surprise with the attention to detail in this room. We escaped and will be back to try the other rooms!
"Escape room ""The Dungeon"" by 13th Hour Haunted House in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/haunted-scarehouse-the-dungeon,2,Loved this place - fun and has a nice atmosphere. The Dungeon turned out to be a good escape room experience for us. The actors really help in keeping the suspense and add a fear factor to whatever you decide to do. An immersive and challenging hour.

The ambience is not too bad except for the yelling of other players in escape rooms next door. There was only one room with a staircase to a balcony, so there is a lot of back and forth in a relatively small space."

Had a great time! I'm not easy to scare, but there are definitely times where I was in laughter because they scared me. Fun times!"

The staff was unbelievably accommodating. They squeezed us in at the very end of the night to do the Dungeon escape room. Not only did they create a slot at midnight for us, they let us finish the game when our hour was up. (We would have only needed 10 more minutes!) The staff stayed in character the entire time even as we were leaving. They never faltered. The escape room itself was quite difficult (and we work at an escape room) we were slightly embarrassed. Being blindfolded and chained up only added to the mystery and excitement. I love how they learned our names and personalized the experience for us. I can't wait to go back and do another room. A sincere thank you to the staff for being so awesome!"
