"Escape room ""The Murder Mystery"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-the-murder-mystery,0,"Super fun! My husband and I have probably done 25+ escape rooms both in the Bay and in other states and countries. (You would think we're really good at them, but no we just enjoy them .) We did the Mystery Room and didn't escape in time (got out in just over an hour). The host was really attentive (he wasn't in the room, but I guess from the monitors he could tell when we were struggling) and asked if we wanted clues at just the right times. He was super nice and friendly too and is why I give this place five stars instead of the four I would probably give just for the room itself.Storyline and theme was just okay, but it was still an overall good time. Would recommend this for a fun little date, the room is doable by two people."
"Escape room ""The Murder Mystery"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-the-murder-mystery,1,"I did the murder room with a group of my friends.  We worked out butts off to figure out the puzzles and beat the room with 1 minute and 30 seconds left before the hour expired.  The room as challenging but totally doable.  Keep yourself organized and have fun!  Great way to build team spirit and have a fun group date.  Best tip is to embrace the experience, lose yourself in the game and you'll have a great time.The PEZ crew was very helpful and the rooms were very well done.5/5 would recommend."
"Escape room ""The Murder Mystery"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-the-murder-mystery,2,"A fun way to spend time with a small group of friends or colleagues, solving a murder! Get a diverse group of buddies and each can work on a different clue or puzzle - we solved the ""crime"" and escaped with only a few moments to spare. If you're looking for a team building exercise - look no further."
