"Escape room ""Backstage"" by Escape AC in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-ac-backstage,0,"First time doing an escape room, and would 100% go back. I was with a bachelor party, so we had to split into two groups, and our group of eight guys went into the Backstage, alas, we could not escape. The truth is, it didn't matter that we couldn't escape, we had an amazing time.I made the reservations over the phone; the staff was very accommodating and explained exactly what an escape room was. When we go there, same thing. Your group does a 5 minute orientation to explain to you exactly what an escape room is, and some general rules and tips to be successful. I won't spoil the room itself; all I'll say is, it was a blast. We had quite a large group in the room, and my personal feeling is it's easier to do it with big groups, but small groups can work too. Once we failed to escape within the 60 minutes, the employee who was watching us the whole time took our picture, and we met up with the other half of our party. Every single person was more then willing to do it again!The $39/person price tag isn't cheap, but totally worth it. I'm not sure if you need a reservation, or they accept walk-ins, but for sure, Escape AC is a must if you are looking for a good time in AC that doesn't involve a deck of cards or dice."

"Escape room ""Backstage"" by Escape AC in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-ac-backstage,2,We had a blast here! The whole place is super clean and classy and the rooms are amazing! We did the poker room and backstage. There were a ton of little puzzles throughout the room and we found them to be very challenging! We've done other escape rooms and definitely found escape ac to be a step above. Can't wait to come back during our next AC trip!
