"Escape room ""Predestined"" by The Box Escape Experience in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/the-box-escape-experience-predestined,0,"Came here for my husbands Birthday and did the Predestined room. We were 4 people total. It was really creative and had a lot of cool details. It reminded me of a spy movie and a Zelda game combined. The guy who led us to the room was very nice and helped add to the atmosphere by keeping in character. It really made the whole thing more fun! We already plan to go back and do another room next time we visit family in Charlotte. I would highly recommend this place! It's a great family activity, or would be great as a office team building event."

There were two other choices but we stayed away since they seemed a tad scary/creepy. The host/attendant played into the whole mood and got you mentally prepared for what was to come. You're allotted an hour to solve the puzzle and though it was a rough start at first we found our stride, especially once we got a few tips. I would totally do this again as this was really fun experience for people who love puzzles."

It's a favorite! The Box always blows us away with the story in the rooms and this one was a real treat. I won't spoil it, but I will say I recommend doing Cold Case Killer and The Ventriloquist first if you can (some great easter eggs). The room itself has lots to do, both as a group and individually. We would regularly work on different puzzles then come together to collaborate on a major piece. The puzzles are mostly intuitive and the few hints we needed were to remember to use things we had already found. The staff is warm, friendly, and in-character. Andy always makes us feel welcome and we'll be back again in the future when their next room opens :)"
