"Escape room ""Battleship"" by Unreal Escapes in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/unreal-escapes-battleship,0,"Super fun, incredibly beautiful and immersive room. Perfect amount of technology and analog. As someone who has played over 50 escape rooms, I can safely say this is in my top five. Puzzles were clever and made me feel smart when I solved them.Highly recommended when you are in the area. Great for team building because of the awesome party room. "

This place is a must visit. The intricacy of the room is amazing, nothing is broken and everything works the way it should. My group will definitely be back to do the other room. Great customer relations as well. The owner was super friendly and helpful."
"Escape room ""Battleship"" by Unreal Escapes in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/unreal-escapes-battleship,2,"This was my 3rd Escape Room and this was the best and most memorable one by far. My kids escaped quite a few escape rooms in the last few years and while my daughter was home for the holiday, all my kids escaped the Disco 54NYC room at Unreal Escapes. They loved it so much that they went back for the Battleship room and convinced me to come along to escape with them. The Battleship room was so much fun and allowed me to see how smart my kids were, and the mastermind behind the whole concept turned the escape into an adventure with ingenious ideas that left a lasting impression for all of us."

It ended up being her present to us! We had a wonderful time. We were able to escape in just under the allotted time. It was not easy! The escape room was a very authentic looking battleship and the puzzles were complicated but solvable if you work as a team. Fortunately for us the rest of the group paid little attention to me and went about solving the riddle of the room. It was such a good time, and my contribution has continued to grow in the re-telling, which has made it even more enjoyable! 5 stars!"
