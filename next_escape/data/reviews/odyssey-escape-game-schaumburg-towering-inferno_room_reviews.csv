"Escape room ""Towering Inferno - Race the Flames"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/odyssey-escape-game-schaumburg-towering-inferno,0,"We did the inferno escape room and loved the multiple rooms aspect. This was a unique experience and we really all had to work in multiple teams to get to the end. The staff was great and the building was very nice! Our finishing time was the quickest so we were thrilled to get on the leader board, go Blues Clues! We’ll be back for more rooms!"

As someone who loves escape rooms, I have to say this is one of the best ones I’ve been to. The puzzles were challenging and the rooms were all so differently and very detailed. The workers were all very nice and helpful as well throughout our “escape”. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!"
"Escape room ""Towering Inferno - Race the Flames"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/odyssey-escape-game-schaumburg-towering-inferno,2,I have done two of the rooms here (Jack the Ripper and Towering Inferno) and have loved both of them! The attention to detail in the rooms is amazing! I would warn people that I think Jack the Ripper is a hard room (and that is not bad); I just think its harder then their website leads you to believe. Titanic or Towering Inferno is where you want to start if you are new to escape rooms. Odyssey - welcome to Chicagoland! Looking forward to doing your other two rooms!
