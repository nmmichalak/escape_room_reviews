"Escape room ""The Shady Tavern"" by Think Escape Games in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/think-escape-games-the-lounge,0,"I recently went to Think Escape and played both the Study and Shady Tavern rooms while on vacation in Ft. Lauderdale with a couple of friends. I've played around a dozen Escape Rooms in total and I would definitely recommend these rooms for those who like to test their wits and perception skills!Both rooms were very themstic which helped with immersion. I also appreciated the mechanical, dexterity-based puzzles in both rooms (especially Shady Tavern) which I haven't really seen in other rooms before. I'm also a sucker for hidden doors and extravagant locking mechanisms, and I was not disappointed here.Overall I would definitely recommend Think Escape to anyone passing through the area, especially those looking for something fun to do with friends or those who have previously enjoyed an escape attempt!"

This is a thinking game and it's really cool to see how everything comes together. We tried everything we thought of, often times laughing at our ideas, but we figured it out and cant wait to go back for the other room."
