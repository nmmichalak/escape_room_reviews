"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,0,I’ve done several escape the room games and they are always really fun. They’re so different from each other that you can keep going and it’s always a challenge.
"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,1,"Did the Pop Star Room of Doom here with a full group of reasonably experienced ppl, and barely made it out. The main draw of the room is that it's very different than traditional escape rooms: the time loop concept was interesting and is why I'm rating this room as high as I am, and I appreciate that they tried something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, I found the execution somewhat lacking: the actors were all good, but the main puzzles just weren't that interesting, and there was a particular thing you had to keep on doing through the game that felt like it was unnecessarily added to the room as filler. The game is weird in that there isn't really that much to do in the game in general, so an individual person will probably contribute exactly one key insight since most of the puzzles are based on observation. This probably is worth checking out for escape room enthusiasts simply due to the premise and novelty of the room, but I imagine that if the idea catches on and more companies starting doing rooms like this (which is honestly not super likely to happen due to the additional cost needed to make this work) then this will end up being a more average experience."
"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,2,"We did the Pop Star's Room of Doom. This is not the escape room for people who love puzzles and the traditional escape room experience. This room is for people who like the sleuthing aspect of escape rooms, can think on their feet, want an interactive experience and want to try a new take on an escape room experience.  I would not do this room with more than 4 people as there is definitely a logjam aspect inherent to the room where you will be doing nothing waiting for something to happen frequently if you have more people. I would rate this room medium to high difficulty level. Bring a lot of people who are super observant with you! MILD SPOILERS:- the actors in the room were so fun and great at improvising as they interacted with us with their snarky responses. I loved this part of the room the most.- the room left a few of us twiddling our thumbs but I don't know a way around this because of the way the puzzle is structured. Nevertheless, we enjoyed wasting time just using our thinking caps in those moments.- I find the structure and planning for this room so creative and intricate, I really admire the planning that must have gone into engineering this experience.- I like how the actors did not try to mislead us with red herrings and drag out the time which some other rooms try to do. - the hinting system may be tough for those who want hints on command, but we found it worked fine."
