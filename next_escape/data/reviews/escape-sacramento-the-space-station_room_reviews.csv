"Escape room ""The Space Station"" by Escape Sacramento in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escape-sacramento-the-space-station,1,My sister and 15 yr old niece came up from Los Angeles to visit and we took them here on a Friday night.  Great time for all of us.  We didn't escape but had a blast.  My niece couldn't stop talking about how fun it was and wants to go back as soon as she can.  Thank you to the ladies running the experience. Great times!!!

The challenges we were tasked at solving were age appropriate, anxiety provoking (in a good way) and of course a lot of fun. You have ample opportunity to try to solve problems and help is readily available by phone. Most of all, it's fairly affordable at about $35 a person. Will definitely do this again!"
