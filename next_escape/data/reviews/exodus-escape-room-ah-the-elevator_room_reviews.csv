"Escape room ""The Elevator"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exodus-escape-room-ah-the-elevator,0,"""The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off!""  --Gloria SteinemI love the Exodus has an escape room for smaller parties.  Our little group of four smarty-pants.... rather, three smarty-pants and one very short but enthusiastic cheerleader (that would be me by the way), had a blast in The Elevator scenario which was perfect for a group of four!  The puzzles were challenging and fun.  The environment was themed so well!  They even had elevator music playing as we worked our way around each dilemma.  We escaped in time, and made the leader board for about 5 minutes as I'm sure other teams have beaten that record by now.  Still, we were proud of it and it was such a fantastic experience for our friends visiting from Oregon!The service was wonderful and the young lady who helped us (she told us her name a few times but I have the memory of a goldfish) was utterly helpful and delightful to talk to.  A young man also game out to greet us, who very much seemed like he was very knowledgeable about the rooms.  Anyway, I digress.  Exodus is fantastic.  And it's located right by an In-N-Out if all that thinking got you hungry."

Last one we did was submarine which was a little bit frustrating but other than that it was good. Favorite room was elevator, make sure you try that out. Puzzles were good and for a room with not a lot of room to work with or tech they made it work. Shoutout to Beth who helped us both times we were there!"

It was my first time doing an escape room and Beth made my experience great. 10/10 would recommend going here! Beth was so funny & friendly. We did the Sherlock Study Holiday version & the Elevator one. Both were so much fun and challenging!
