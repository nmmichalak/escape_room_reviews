"Escape room ""Prey"" by Escape Room Madness in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/59-59-room-escape-hound,0,"We had a really great experience at 59:59! We decided to try out the Hounds of Baskerville room on a Saturday night. The booking process was super easy, and once we got there we started right on time. One thing to note though is that this is a 10 people room, and so we paired up with another group of six. This actually turned out to be quite fun, so don't worry about it being uncomfortable or anything!The room itself was great. The clues were challenging, but definitely not impossible. There was a small story plot as well, which I loved. In case you get stuck, the staff will send out clues in riddle forms. We had a lot of lucky guesses, and Richard walked us through again. Overall, this was a great experience, and I'd recommend 59:59 for everybody! We want to try out the darker themed room next time."

I have been there twice so far. Friendly staff. And most importantly, puzzles r well designed. Between the Christmas Ghosts and hound of the Baskervilles, I like Baskervilles more because I am not good at word puzzles. It really just personal preference and what u better at."
"Escape room ""Prey"" by Escape Room Madness in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/59-59-room-escape-hound,2,We went to 59:59 escape room on a Saturday evening and decided to do the hound of baskervilles room. An absolute fun evening spent solving clues and playing Sherlock Holmes. We managed to lock ourselves out with 3.00mins remming.This is definitely a fun team building event that also helps people to mingle and solve things together and play detective for an hour.  The puzzles are pretty hard but it really makes you think on your toes. On top of that the customer service is excellent as well. A must do to spruce things up in your life . Highly recommend this place.

We had a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday. For once, I actually came early, so I got to play with some puzzles in the lobby. They were not strict on starting time anyway, which was fortunate since one of us was running late.We did the Hound of the Baskervilles room, obviously themed by the Sherlock Holmes story. Once again, they had stickers marking items that had nothing to do with the escape, a bit more subtle this time though. The room was very lock heavy, mostly solving clues to get the right combos. It was fun, but a little bit too easy since we got out in about half an hour."

The puzzles were challenging but not impossible and we had a blast. Vivian, who was at the front desk, was accommodating and awesome. We already have purchased passes to go back to play another room! Woohoo!"

Something different was what we all needed to stray away from the usual restaurant outings. We arrived late unfortunately (due to oversleeping our nap) but the staff was so kind and welcoming. We chose ""The Hounds of Baskerville."" We were given clear instructions on the goal and also what wasn't necessary to do in order to reach that goal. There were so many steps but we were glad because for our group of eight, there was plenty for each person to do. When we got stuck, the clues the staff gave to us via a monitor in the room were extremely helpful. We are definitely doing this again as soon as our schedules allow for it. Keep up the good work!"
