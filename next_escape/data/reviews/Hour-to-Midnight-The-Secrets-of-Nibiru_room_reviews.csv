The decor and puzzles were high quality and very well done! We also liked the lights and sound effects! The lobby was very large, clean and they had lots of escape theme box games for sale. Melissa was very friendly and funny and we enjoyed meeting and talking with the owners as well. You can tell that they're passionate about doing a quality job with these rooms and are very creative."

It was a challenge but escaped with time to spare. I have done other room escapes but this one by far was one of the best I have been too. Totally worth trying!!!!
