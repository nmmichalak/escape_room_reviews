"Escape room ""Time Paradox"" by Amazing Escape Room in Freehold",https://worldofescapes.com/freehold/quests/amazing-escape-room-time-paradox,0,I have been there with a group of friends twice now in 2 weeks. We tried the Time Paradox room the first time and the Wizard room just yesterday. We've had a blast both times and have not yet been disappointed. We are coming back next month to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Hoping to get the Wild West room. I'm totally looking forward to it!

The room wasn't too easy, so I wouldn't recommend it for kids. It was tough to get going but we figured it out with 15 minutes to spare, second best time of the day!"
