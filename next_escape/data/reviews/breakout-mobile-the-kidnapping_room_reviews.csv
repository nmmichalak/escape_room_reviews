"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-the-kidnapping,0,"Went yesterday as a group of four friends. The most fun I've had in a couple of years on an outing! We did the Kidnapping and broke out in 56 minutes. If you want a challenge and an outright rush of adrenaline, I highly suggest doing these games! The staff was great as well. Overall a thrill!"
