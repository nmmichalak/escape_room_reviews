"Escape room ""Vendetta"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-vendetta,0,A great birthday experience! Our group of 8 went for my son's 13th birthday and we were successful in unlocking the Vendetta room with 1 minute and 58 seconds remaining!

I was in the Vendetta room which is very heist/safe cracking and mind puzzle themed which was very demanding on the brain, you don't really know how you're doing on time so you have to keep moving because you don't know when the search is over, I recommend you go here with a group of 5 people!"

It was heart pounding, nail biting fun. Our Game Master was Andrew and he was outstanding. We can't wait to go back for the Spooky Room... Andrew, get ready for us!"
"Escape room ""Vendetta"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-vendetta,3,We were celebrating a birthday with a group of friends and thought an escape room would be something different and fun. We had a great time. We cannot wait to go back and check out the spooky room.
"Escape room ""Vendetta"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-vendetta,4,"What a surprise to find Astoria has an escape room game, and a top notch one at that. We did the Vendetta room – my ninth escape room, and a first for my sister and friend. This being a new room, I expected some kinks would still be working out, or some beginner-level puzzles, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. Well thought out with a sophisticated mix of technology, set construction, and props. A good mix of complex puzzles, and some so simple you smack your head and wonder why you didn’t think of it sooner. Our game master helped steer us in the right direction via messages on TV monitors in the rooms, but the hints were never so revealing that it felt like he was doing the work for us. The plot was great – interesting story, but not more than you needed. We finished with 2 minutes to spare and we can’t wait to go back! Highly recommended for both veterans and first-timers alike. Definitely one of the best rooms I’ve ever done. Go!"
