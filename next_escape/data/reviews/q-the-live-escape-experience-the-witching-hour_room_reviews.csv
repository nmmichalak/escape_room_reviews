"Escape room ""The Witching Hour"" by Q: The Live Escape Experience in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/q-the-live-escape-experience-the-witching-hour,1,Last year we visited the Q: The Live Escape Experience in Loveland and this year we decided to try the one in Greeley. It's in a basement which gives an eerie feeling before you even enter the Escape Room. We chose the Witching Hour. It was a lot of fun and we made it out at 59:59 minutes. Although I think the employee was generous letting us have that last second. We plan to go back every year for team building.

What an experience that was enjoyed by all! I would advise anyone to go and participate.!!! It was a blast!!"
