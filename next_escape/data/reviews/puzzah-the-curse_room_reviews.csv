"Escape room ""The Curse"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-the-curse,0,"Puzzah at Flatirons is AWFUL.  Puzzles arenâ€™t reset, it is a mall atmosphere and the puzzles themselves are HORRIBLE. The Curse room is the single worst room of over 40 I have done "

The rooms are automated like nothing I've ever seen! It's a great experience start to finish, the staff is delightful as well. I will definitely be back for more!!"
