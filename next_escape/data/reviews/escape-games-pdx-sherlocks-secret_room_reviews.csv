The team members who set us up on the Sherlock Holmes mission were great. They showed a true genuine passion for working there and were very friendly. We ended up getting out with 10 minutes left and only using one clue. Truly a team effort and amazing bonding experience with our team! Thanks for creating a lasting memory I can celebrate with colleagues.
