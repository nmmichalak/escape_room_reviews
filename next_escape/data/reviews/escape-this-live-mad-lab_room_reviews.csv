Challenging, varied, and full of surprises! We had a crazy fun time and felt like heroes when we defused the bomb! Holy cow, what a thrill. Amazing owner, exceptional service, and beautifully done professional atmosphere!"
"Escape room ""Mad Lab"" by Escape This Live in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/escape-this-live-mad-lab,2,So much fun! Really high-quality rooms. We did the Lab and it was really challenging and that math problem was killer! I have been to several escape rooms in different states and this was one of the best! The effects and props were excellent! I am super bummed we didn’t “escape” so we will be back to try another room and redeem ourselves!
