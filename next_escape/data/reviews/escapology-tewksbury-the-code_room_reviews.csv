Charlie, our game master, was excellent at giving us the hints we needed to help us along the way! It's also great that they have a fully stocked bar! Not sure if the booze helped or hindered our solve time. We did TH3 C0D3, which is rated as the second EASIEST! Can't wait to go back and try more!"
