"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Locked: Escape Game in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/locked-escape-game-franklin-antidote,0,We did the Antidote room and loved it! The clues were very well done and challenged us. We love the rooms and staff at Locked. We cannot wait to go back!
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Locked: Escape Game in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/locked-escape-game-franklin-antidote,1,"Antidote was my 5th escape room. It is a fairly small room that can be done by three people or even two. There are not that many rooms out there that are both small enough for a tiny group but still engaging and challenging. So, if you are looking for a room that is not huge but is very well designed, this is a good one. Staff is laid back and will give you as little or as much help as you want. Plus, they are very efficient about check-in."

Diego was great, gave us some extra clues since it was just my husband and myself with our three kids. We came sooooooooooooooo close to finishing! What a great time, we will be back!"
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Locked: Escape Game in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/locked-escape-game-franklin-antidote,3,Played Antidote last weekend. We were a group of 6 - 4 of us and 2 others joined the group. We worked well as a team and escaped! The puzzles were very challenging and took patience to complete. It was well worth the money for an hour of fun!
