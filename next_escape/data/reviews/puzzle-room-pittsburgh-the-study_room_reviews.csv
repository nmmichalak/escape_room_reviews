"Escape room ""The Study"" by Puzzle Room Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/puzzle-room-pittsburgh-the-study,0,"The Study escape room was so intricately designed and layed out in such a way that it constantly challenged my mind and emphasized teamwork with friends. The clues and puzzles in this room were creative, surprising, and artfully designed. It was easy to see the creator's passion in every tiny detail of this room. By far this has been my best escape room experience and I look forward to returning to try my luck in the Sasquatch room."
"Escape room ""The Study"" by Puzzle Room Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/puzzle-room-pittsburgh-the-study,1,"I have done escape rooms in the past, and this one was very well done. It was my 12 yr old niece and me (her first room). We did The Study which was well done and had enough clues and puzzles to keep the excitement going. We both had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend the Puzzle Room to others. The only negative was the room could have had more light - at times it was difficult to read some of the clues with the low light. The staff was excellent and friendly. We look forward to trying the other room, and they informed us they will open a 3rd room soon."

My mother, sister, and I did ""The Study"" and it was really well thought out and clever.  I thought it was going to end on many occasions, but was pleasantly surprised when the puzzles continued. My mother and sister had not been to an escape room before and they also loved it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area, I will be coming back in the future."
