"Escape room ""Suite Escape"" by Count:down Escape Games in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/countdown-escape-games-suite-escape,0,"Tucked away in the corner of a Home Depot shopping plaza, it's easy to miss if you don't see the sign right away. There was a coupon that we decided to use for the game. We went for the Suite Escape room. It's the hardest one come to find out after we got there and we decided to attempt it.The room as well as the other two that are there consists of locks and combos to open by figuring out puzzles and using clues for them in the room.  It's better to have more than less in the group since it helps with the brainstorming and solving of the puzzles. Even though our group lost, we still had fun and we plan to go back to do a different room next time."
