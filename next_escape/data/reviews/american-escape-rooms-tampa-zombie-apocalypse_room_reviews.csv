"Escape room ""Zombie Apocalypse"" by American Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/american-escape-rooms-tampa-zombie-apocalypse,0,"Such an awesome experience! I'm a huge escape room fan (I do one in every state I travel to) and living in Tampa, I try to support all of the local ones. First time at this one and hands down, one of the best rooms I've every played. Myself and a close friend did the zombie apocalypse room by ourselves (which is fine, we like the challenge) and had SO much fun. Shout out to our game master, Kristen for good hints and being super awesome during the game. We escaped! I'll 100000% be back to try the Cold War room and mad professor. Great quality games, good pricing and a very accommodating staff."

Clues were difficult but doable, and the hints were very helpful! We did Zombie Apocalypse (just two of us) and almost finished!"

We had an outstanding time! Our diverse ages made the experience even more fun as we laughed our way through puzzling out the clues. We highly recommend American Escape Rooms as a fun and exciting family activity."
