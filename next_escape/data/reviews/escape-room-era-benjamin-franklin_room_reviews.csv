"Escape room ""Christmas at Franklin's"" by Escape Room Era in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-era-benjamin-franklin,0,"We did this with a group of 8 yesterday and despite having done over many, many different rooms, this one had a number of things that pleasantly surprised us. You can tell David takes a great deal of pride in his work, and the way he incorporates historical stuff about Benjamin Franklin into the room was lots of fun. There is a good mix of physical and mind puzzles too. The ending was great! Can't wait to see the new room here. We will be back."

David was so nice and fun and creative. I think the payoff of solving the puzzle was the best I have seen yet! There were also a lot of fun, different puzzles to solve that you don't normally and the whole group was busy at work. Loved this room and the historical Easter eggs. Thanks David! We will be back when you open even more rooms for sure!"
"Escape room ""Christmas at Franklin's"" by Escape Room Era in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-era-benjamin-franklin,2,"This escape room gets high marks for customer service and puzzle quality. The creator of this room (actually, rooms, since there are about three rooms for the game) put much effort into keeping the story line and its theme running throughout, from the signing of the liability form, to the grand finale. Many of the puzzles were very ingenious. Some really puzzled us, but once we figured them out we all had to say, ""Oh, wow!""  "
