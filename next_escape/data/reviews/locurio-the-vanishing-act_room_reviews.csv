"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,4,"I've done escape rooms at about a half dozen companies and Locurios was far and away the best! Perfect quantity and quality of puzzles, fantastic theming and room design, everything was easy to do when doing it right (no having to force locks or mash buttons) and I was never afraid I'd break something investigating, the puzzles were ingenious and frequently required many of us having different insights to put it all together, but I never felt completely lost, just like I needed to think more. It was also great that there were multiple things you could work on simultaneously so even though we had a team of eight everyone was always busy (yet everyone got to see everything that happened). Just all around perfect. I cannot recommend it highly enough! PLEASE design another room so we can come back!"
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,5,Just came out here for my birthday yesterday and it was an absolute blast! I had reserved the 8 tickets for me and my friends and I highly recommend doing so! Challenging but so exciting and fun! Probably would be a lot more difficult with strangers in my opinion.
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,6,"This was my first puzzle room, a gift to my sister for her birthday, and it was her first puzzle room as well. We had an absolute blast! Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The puzzles are fantastically detailed, and it was interesting seeing the teamwork it took to solve them. I would certainly do this again, and I'm looking forward to seeing what they have next! Thank you!"
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,7,"Wow. This room was amazing!!! Every puzzle was themed & complimented the story & feel of the room. The room is well taken care of & everything is cleverly placed. I wish I could ""neuralize"" myself like they do in Men In Black so I could do this room again. By far the best escape room I've done in Seattle (so far I've done 4 including Locurio). Highly recommended!!! Thank you Locurio for an amazing time!!!"
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,8,"This was a really great experience. It surpassed my expectations. From the dramatic start to the magical conclusion, this was a very engaging puzzle room. The quality of the room and the puzzles were excellent and the staff was super. Our team was able to finish, but I feel like the difficulty was just right. I highly recommend this unique experience."
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,9,"I went to Locurio this week with a group of four men to do the Vanishing Act. I had heard about it online from a friend and could not wait to check out all the buzz. I must say, it was a very well done experience and I could tell that they put a lot of thought into placing you into the mood.From my experience, this one is the best escape room in Seattle and ranks right up there with others that I have done in other states. I highly recommend their room. The music, the lights, and the puzzles really put you into the mood. The room has tons of surprises too throughout the experience. The puzzles we unique, the solutions made sense once we solved them and all their locks functioned well.For the staff, they really get into character which I enjoyed and keep you in the zone. It is not an easy room but that made it fun and it really challenged us. I did enjoy the staff letting us a couple questions at end and showing a couple hidden surprises.We will be back next time we are in town to try again to find even more fun and surprises."

"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,11,My first puzzle room... was a very fun event! Would recommend it to other novices like myself.. I was surprised that I actually contributed and caught some clues!
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,12,"This was so much fun!!! Quality sets, fun puzzles, and a immersive ""scary"" storytelling adventure. If you have 70 minutes to try something new ... then this puzzle room is a ""must do"" in Seattle! Wish we could have had 120 minutes of play time."
"Escape room ""The Vanishing Act"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-vanishing-act,13,"Locurio provided an amazing, thoughtful, and challenging experience! I have done a few room escape games and this one was far and away the highest quality and most innovative one I've experienced. The level of puzzling is unmatched! A must!!!"
