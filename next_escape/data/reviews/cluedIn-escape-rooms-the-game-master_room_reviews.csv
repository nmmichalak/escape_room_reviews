I was accompanied by a few 11-year-olds and a few adults. We did the Game Master which was just right for our ability and the theme was appropriate for all. So fun and very happy with our experience!

There were four in our group and four people we had never met. The clues were well thought out and challenging. I would highly recommend Clued In. Can't wait to try the Asylum.

We've been to several in the area and have had tons of fun. The Gamemaster was hands down my fav! The host was fantastic, and we were matched with a great group. Very creative clues and puzzles. We escaped with only 16 seconds left which, to me, means it was a perfect escape room!"
