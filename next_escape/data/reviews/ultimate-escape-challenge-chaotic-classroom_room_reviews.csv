"Escape room ""Chaotic Classroom 1 & 2"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/ultimate-escape-challenge-chaotic-classroom,0,"This place will be closed in no time.  Staff there said business is, ""really slow"" and I can see why - HORRIBLE treatment of customers! I took my children here and the staff member that was working with us was so rude to my son he nearly cried. I called the owner to let her know how rudely my son was spoken to and her response was, ""you can bring your son back in and I will have the staff member apologize to him, but that is all I will do"". Her remedy was to have me drive over an hour round trip to have a rude high school employee say, ""sorry"" to my 9 year old - the owner does not care about the customers, she is just clinging to every last penny she can make before her business sinks.   I strongly encourage you to seek another venue if you are looking for an escape challenge.. WHAT A HUGE WASTE OF $85.00"

We didn't make it out in time, but we'll definitely go back now, especially since we have an idea of what to do and can get a jump on it the next time. Well worth the money. My kid wanted to stay and immediately take on another challenge/room."
