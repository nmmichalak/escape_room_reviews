"Escape room ""Egyptian Mysteries"" by Escape Haus in San Marcos",https://worldofescapes.com/san-marcos/quests/escape-haus-egyptian-mysteries,0,My friends and I had an amazing time solving the Egyptian Mysteries room last weekend! The puzzles were challenging enough to keep us engaged without being frustrating. The staff was very friendly and kept us engaged in the room. We're already planning to come back and solve the others!

We had a blast! None of us had ever been to an activity like this before so we were a little bit slow in starting out but it didn't take us long to get into the swing of things. We really enjoyed it!"
