"Escape room ""Escape from Mars"" by ESCAPEability in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapability-escape-from-mars,2,We did the Mars room. I've done multiple escape rooms from different places and have to say that this one was by far the worst. The price was cheap that's why they are getting 2 stars. It felt like they didn't put a lot of time into it. Having multiple people was a disadvantage due to only being able to solve one thing at a time to move on. The rooms looked pretty basic and didn't follow the storyline.

The Mars room was great, we pictured ourselves being Mark Watney, but we are sure he wouldn't be able to escape this room! Challenging yet not impossible, all in all great fun. Will be back!"
