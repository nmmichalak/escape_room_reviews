"Escape room ""Where in the World?"" by Beach Escape Game in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/beach-escape-game-where-in-the-world,0,"We got this as a Christmas Present from our family, so we decided to take them with us. I would highly recommend it! It was challenging yet fun and made us work together the entire time. Everyone was involved and pulled their weight. We did Around the World, apparently the toughest room, and escaped with just 30 seconds to spare. No time was wasted! Great staff too!!!"

We all worked great together even though we were strangers. The clues were well thought out, challenging and really exciting! We had a fantastic time ( especially since we made it out with less than 10 seconds left)!! We will be back to try out the other 3 rooms!"
"Escape room ""Where in the World?"" by Beach Escape Game in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/beach-escape-game-where-in-the-world,2,"We came in to Beach Escape Game as a group of four and did the Caged and Where in the World rooms. We escaped both with very little time to spare, but had a great time. The staff was very friendly and we will definitely be coming back to do the other two rooms on our next trip."
