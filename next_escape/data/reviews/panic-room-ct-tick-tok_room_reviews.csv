"Escape room ""Tick Tok"" by Panic Room CT in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/panic-room-ct-tick-tok,1,"This was our first escape room. We did Tik Tok and loved it, came very close to solving it with only two locks left. I was worried it might not be something we all would enjoy, but that was not the case. Our group ranged from 16-21 and we all agreed we will definitely do it again! Super fun and challenging!"

We had a great time! This is a wonderful ""game"" to play where the cell phones are not just put away but you don't even think about them. We can't wait to book a different room and do it all over again! Thanks Panic Room!"
