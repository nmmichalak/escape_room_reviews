"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Evansville in Evansville",https://worldofescapes.com/evansville/quests/breakout-games-evansville-operation-casino,0,We went with another couple after work to do the Casino mission. First time doing an escape room and it was a great evening. Got to think and work together to solve the clues. We got done with 2 minutes to go. Would like to do another room soon.

What a great time! The staff were friendly. Especially Jessica our game master. The puzzles were challenging and fun too. We would do this again."
