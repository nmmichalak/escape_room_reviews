Our cluemaster Asher did an excellent job of letting us go through the room but giving us help when we needed it, allowing for it to be challenging but still really fun so we could finish the room with 7 minutes to spare. We'd love to go back at some point and do the other rooms, as the rest of the staff was great too."
