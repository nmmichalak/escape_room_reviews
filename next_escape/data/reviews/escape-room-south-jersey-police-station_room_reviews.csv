"Escape room ""Police Station"" by Exit 4 Private Escape Rooms in Glassboro",https://worldofescapes.com/glassboro/quests/escape-room-south-jersey-police-station,0,"I was in a group of 10 people in the Police Station room. Many times, my friends felt like we were just standing around because others were working on a task. There was just not as many tasks to complete overall or simultaneously as previous Escape Rooms I have been to. The room was also fairly easy; my group finished it in a little over 30 minutes with no hints used.However, the room and its puzzles were still fun and creative and the staff was great. If you have never done an escape room, this would still be an awesome place to go, especially with the wide variety of rooms they offer."
