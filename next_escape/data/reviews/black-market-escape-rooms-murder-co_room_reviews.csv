"Escape room ""MURDER CO."" by Black Market Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/black-market-escape-rooms-murder-co,1,"**Murder Co Hardcore is an experience, keep that in mind**As a huge fan of horror, I was pretty stoked to try Murder Co. I do not jump or scare easily so I thought I had this in the bag...boy was I wrong. My heart was pounding and my anxiety was through the roof. The room was so immersive that I thought I was going to be the next victim of Maneater (the scare actor who played Maneater was absolutely amazing!!). Everyone involved in this room did a phenomenal jobs and scared the daylights out of my whole group. If you have the chance, do Murder Co. Hardcore! This was truly the best horror escape experience I have ever had. Thank you Black Market Escape Room for such an amazing experience and making me feel alive (ironically lol)."
"Escape room ""MURDER CO."" by Black Market Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/black-market-escape-rooms-murder-co,2,This is my favorite escape room I have ever done and I have done more then 20. I can't wait to come back again and bring different friends to see how they do and watch their reactions. It truly is an immersive experience. Great staff from the second we got there til the second we left. I wish I can give them 6 stars. Everyone did an amazing job thank you so much for your hospitality. Highly recommend this place!
