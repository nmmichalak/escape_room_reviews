"Escape room ""Mansion Library. The Abduction"" by Escape Challenge St. Louis in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-challenge-st-louis-mansion-library,2,"From an experienced escape room player, I would have to say the Mansion Library room is my new favorite of all-time. The room is very well put together, the clues and puzzles all make sense, and the puzzles are actually fun. You don't feel like they are monotonous tasks to just get from one clue to the other. It's supposed to be the hardest room they have, and I can definitely see why. The group of 6 right before us came out and they couldn't complete it in time. We only had 2 people in our group, so we were a little nervous. Thankfully, our previous escape room knowledge and ability to work incredibly well together paid off and we got out with about 2 minutes remaining."
