Unfortunately, we didn't make it out but the game truly tested our reasoning skills and teamwork. It's also a great outing for when you meet new people, everyone gets to relax and just have fun."

We actually finished with just over 10 minutes to spare. We definitely could have spent more time on it though if we weren't as careful. We had such a wonderful time, they gave us just enough information to get you to the next clue without it being super obvious. Definitely challenged our minds. Will definitely come back and try the harder ones!!!!"
