"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Pigeon Forge in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Escape-Game-Pigeon-Forge-The-Heist,0,"My family and I had a fantastic time trying to figure out The Heist. The rooms were very well done and laid out. We loved the details and the steps required to move forward in the game.Although we didn’t quite make it (we literally had the painting and informational to get out of the room before the time ran out), the experience was a blast! The staff was extremely helpful and made the game all the more enjoyable. We’re looking forward for when we can come back and try the other games offered."

The room was so cool and props were great. We had to ask for several clues. It was just my 2 boys and myself. We luckily figured it out in the nick of time and found the missing painting!!! Many things to make you think for sure.

We read about the Escape Game, we booked (Prison Break) and had an absolutely awesome time! Two days later, we booked (Heist), and the fun continued there! If you enjoy a challenge we highly recommend (Prison Break )."
