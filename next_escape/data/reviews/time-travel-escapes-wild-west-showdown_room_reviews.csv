Even if anyone is nervous about being in a closed room, she will walk you and show you the key and make your worries go away! We did the Wild West and the men did One if by land. If you need reading glasses don't forget them, cause you will need them to read things. All in all the rooms were very well put together and cleverly done!"

We had a blast. The owners are terrific and did everything to ensure we had a great time. Will definitely go back to try the other two rooms. We did the Wild West. Definitely recommend!
