"Escape room ""Doggy Dog World"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-doggy-dog-world,0,"I am finally getting around to reviewing this room - I just had to! My husband and I have done about 50 rooms and Doggy Dog World is our favorite so far. At first, we were concerned that it would be too easy (the pictures make it seem a bit kid-oriented). But, I'm glad I didn't let that stop us from checking it out. We had a blast! The puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly so and the overall concept is so unique and creative, we wish there were a ton more like it. If you're looking for a great room, try this one - you won't be disappointed!"

This is a wonderful room - lots of fun and really well done. If you haven't done it, I recommend making time to play before the room closes."
