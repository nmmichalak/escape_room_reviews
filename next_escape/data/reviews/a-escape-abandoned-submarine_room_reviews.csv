"Escape room ""Abandoned Submarine"" by A-Escape in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/a-escape-abandoned-submarine,0,"One of the best escape rooms in Asheville.  The room put immersed you in the story and made the puzzles that much more fun to solve.  Our party was fairly large (I usually just do these with 4 people), but most everyone had a job to do with this room.  This one is highly recommended for those who want a decently scary atmosphere added to their escape experience. "
"Escape room ""Abandoned Submarine"" by A-Escape in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/a-escape-abandoned-submarine,1,"Incredible. Attention to detail and ambience of the room was on point. Puzzles were difficult but intuitive. I was legitimately scared in the Submarine room which was awesome. My group has done many, many escape rooms across the country and this is hands down the best room we've been to. Guides were friendly and so helpful! Thanks for the great experience!"
"Escape room ""Abandoned Submarine"" by A-Escape in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/a-escape-abandoned-submarine,2,My team and I did the Submarine room and loved it. The puzzles were challenging and well put together. I have done more than a dozen escape rooms and this one is definitely towards the top of my list. My only complaint is that we didn't have the time to do them all!
