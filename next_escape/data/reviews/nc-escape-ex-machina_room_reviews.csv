The puzzles were varied and just the right difficulty level (for a hard rated room). It was just two of us and we felt that the room could be completed with any size group. Our game master was helpful, friendly, and attentive. We highly recommend for newbies and experienced escapers alike."

There were a ton of interactive puzzles with really cool technology behind them. The puzzles require you to really think and work together with your team. If you're stuck, you can get a hint from the game master. I really liked the steampunk mysterious vibe the room had. Overall, I highly recommend NC Escape!"

We did two of their rooms, The Study and Ex Machina. The second room was just amazing. That room had some of the most creative puzzles I've seen in an escape room. I cannot recommend that room highly enough!Aside from the rooms, the staff is very friendly and professional, the building is great, and parking is surprisingly convenient for downtown Durham. I plan on coming back."
