"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-mystery-mansion,0,"I live in Des Moines and have done most of the escape rooms available in the city. Mystery Mansion at Breakout is my favorite room of theirs. I did the room with my husband and a friend, and we finished with around 10 minutes to spare. We only asked for a few hints, and the puzzles were so much fun to solve. I highly recommend this room."

This was our first experience and we all had a really fun time! But know, you pretty much HAVE to ask for clues to pass. We thought we could do it without asking for clues, and learned afterwards no one has ever passed without asking for clues. Afterwards, we were also told the average amount of clues asked is 5-10. So keep that in mind when you go in to play!"
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-mystery-mansion,2,"I took my daughter and a few of her friends here to celebrate her 12th birthday. The girls did Mystery Mansion and absolutely loved it! (Age range: 10-14). I went in as a chaperone since they weren't old enough to go alone, but I didn't have to pay for a spot (and I didn't help with solving). Our staff member, Aaron, was great with the girls, giving them some extra clues at times when he knew they may not understand what they were looking for. They finished just in the nick of time (55:59) and they had so much fun. They all talked about how they wanted to come back and try the other rooms!"

We chose the Mystery Mansion and it was AWESOME! It was the first time ever doing an escape room for both of us, but we were able to make it out in the end! Our guide was so nice and you could really tell he was having fun too. We will definitely be back for more games in the future!"
