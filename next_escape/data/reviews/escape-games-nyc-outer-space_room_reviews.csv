"Escape room ""Outer Space"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-outer-space,0,The staff were very professional and I was very pleased with their service. Originally we booked the detective room but we wanted to switch to this one in the last minute. The concept was good but the execution was poor.  Puzzles weren't difficult but they were extremely frustrating because their machines were extremely sensitive and there wasn't much of an indication if anything was opened. The game also lacked some sort of flow. You didn't really have to work together to solve anything so if you're looking for a group building experience then this wouldn't be my top choice.

I highly recommend this company for the staff and design of their rooms. Outer Space is one of my favorites. Well themed, I really felt like I was in a spaceship. Escape rooms are all about immersion and this room delivers. Puzzles are themed and connected to form an overarching mission. Puzzles are modern, task-based as opposed to combination locks. Easy to med. difficulty. Four of us escaped in 40 min. "

It was surprisingly challenging, but not frustrating. The 5 of us had a great time, and I can't wait to do another!!! The hosts there were also really helpful and friendly."

Woo! I would recommend this experience if you're looking for a fun interactive activity to do with a group of folks, co-workers, etc."
"Escape room ""Outer Space"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-outer-space,4,"Had a great time.  The staff was very friendly and informative.  Gave us as much instructions as possible without giving away the game.  We played the ""Outta Space"" theme and escaped with less than 6 minutes to spare.  Some of my friends thinks the puzzles weren't as challenging at another game we played elsewhere, but I think it's because this is the second mission game we played and know what to expect.  This really require some team work and we had a great team.   Will come back and try their Detective Story game.  Go ""Team D""!!!"

I had gone to another place a couple of times, but this place was on a whole different level.  We chose the spaceship room and it looked really slick.  The puzzles were challenging but not confusing -- that is, the sequence you needed to solve things in was pretty clear, you just needed to figure out how to do it.  If you needed help, a staff member could type you messages on one of the monitors. You can play with up to six people in a room.  Unlike other places I have been, you only ever play with your own group.  The plus side is that you don't have to play with strangers.  The downside is that if you have a small team, it costs more per person.  The staff were very friendly and engaging.  We will definitely be back to try the detective room."

I've done a couple of escape rooms around NYC, and this is one of the good ones! Having a private room is also a plus since being with people you know won't make it awkward and it's easier to split the work and assign tasks to one another. We didn't escape, but we were working on the final puzzle and only missed escaping by a minute or two. So close! Had a great time, would definitely recommend this location!"
"Escape room ""Outer Space"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-outer-space,7,"By far one of the best escape rooms in the city.  Everything is really well thought out and creative.  They only have two rooms right now... but, I hear a third is in the works.  Our group started off with the harder ""space"" room.  Oh man, it was hard!  We didn't escape, but we were very close!!!  I think if we had 10 more minutes we could have totes gotten it!  I haven't tried the detective room yet, but we were given a tour and I'm excited to give it a go soon.  A friend of mine did try it out and said it was considerably easier than the space room.  So, maybe you should try that one out first for the confidence boost hahahhahaa"
