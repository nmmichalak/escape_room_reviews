"Escape room ""Patient Zero"" by Fort Wayne Escape Room in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/fort-wayne-escape-room-patient-zero,5,It was a great time! Very challenging. We went with two groups -- one that escaped the pirate room and another that came very close to escaping the patient zero room (if only we had one more minute). We're hoping to come back and try the larger room in a month or two!
