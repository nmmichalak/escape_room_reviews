"Escape room ""The Surgery"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-the-surgery,1,"A group of us tried out the Puzzle Parlour doctor-themed puzzle room. It was entertaining, challenging but not impossible, and the production values were excellent. A group full of newbies all had their moments to shine, and everyone had a blast. We'll definitely be back to check out Heist, and any and all new rooms Ken creates."
"Escape room ""The Surgery"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-the-surgery,2,Had a blast figuring out the Surgery puzzle. Despite being seven very well educated men it took us almost all our allotted time to escape! Highly recommend the experience!
"Escape room ""The Surgery"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-the-surgery,3,I had such a blast in Surgery! The puzzles were very clever and we encountered more doors than I had expected. We needed several clues since we were only two people in our private group. The game master/host was clear with directions beforehand and helpful with clues throughout. We enjoyed speaking with the staff afterward too. Highly recommend!

From the awesome staff to the lobby decor and actual game itself, you are guaranteed to have an amazing time. Our group of five did the Surgery room for a friend's birthday. We enjoyed it being just us in the room. We laughed, we cheered each time we figured something out, we made it out with about 9 mins to spare. The debriefing after the game was lovely and the staff member who greeted us in the end was great."
