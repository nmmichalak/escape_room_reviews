"Escape room ""Return To Planet Earth Junior"" by Code Breakers in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/code-breakers-return-to-planet-earth-junior,0,"We have done both Return to Planet Earth and the Cloning Experiment activities (kids 7-12 level). Grown ups and children enjoyed finding the clues, working in teams and scratching their heads when tasks were challenging. You can always ask for help. The game is hard enough that kids feel encouraged finding the answers but not so difficult that is frustrating. Bob was very helpful with the introduction to the room and taking pictures of our clones. Highly recommended!"
