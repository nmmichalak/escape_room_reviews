"Escape room ""Cabin in the Woods"" by The Great Escape in Cameron",https://worldofescapes.com/cameron/quests/the-great-escape-cabin-in-the-woods,0,Got a last minute date night and LOVED it! Can't wait to go again! We went in The Cabin In the Woods room and beat the clock by 17 minutes! The locks and puzzles were insane and I haven't stopped thinking about my experience since then. The staff is sweet and make you feel really immersed into the story.
