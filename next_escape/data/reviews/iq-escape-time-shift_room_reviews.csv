"Escape room ""Time Shift"" by IQ Escape in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/iq-escape-time-shift,0,"One of our favorites. We did the Time Shift room, dubbed Pittsburgh's hardest room and I can see why. We posted one of the best scores ever and the team had a blast. The staff was super helpful and provided just the right amount of support. Will definately go back in the future."
