"Escape room ""Cabin"" by Amazing Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/rush-escape-room-cabin,0,So much fun! My friends and I did the Cabin for my husbands birthday. We had to ask for one clue (out of three) but made it out with about 8 minutes to spare! We had 5 in our group and I fit in the rooms just fine. It was fun and took teamwork to finish. We are hoping to come back soon and do the virus room!
