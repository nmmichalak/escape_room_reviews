"Escape room ""The Great Escape"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-the-great-escape,0,"We had an amazing time ending our double  date night at Xterious Escape. Our group did the ""Great Escape"" game. Without giving away any spoilers, you're a fugitive trying to escape jail. You start off inside of the jail cell and with each room you solve, it takes you one step closer to being free. I definitely recommend this game if you're looking for a challenging obstacle that allows your team to partner in pairs. Apparently, the best solve record was under 25 minutes, but sadly it took our group the full hour.  Our experience at XE was very positive. The staffs were friendly and attentive. They readily answered the walkie-talkes whenever we needed help and gave us informative clues in a timely manner. The place was clean and located in a good area near the strip. Also, the rooms were nicely decorated with props that were high-tech and believable. Overall, I highly recommend this place."

It was challenging and we couldn't have done it without our wonderful host. You definitely get your money's worth. The rooms were authenticly decorated and full of clues, surprises, and puzzles. I would highly recommend these rooms! We can't wait to go back and try more of the rooms, Casino room next for us! Can't wait!"
"Escape room ""The Great Escape"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-the-great-escape,2,Went here with our friends visiting from CA. There were 5 couple and 2 kids. The staff was nice enough to let the kids come in. We played the Great Escape Husbands vs Wives. They have 2 identical rooms which you can pass at the same time to compete who escapes first. We won! Go Wives :)
