"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Akron",https://worldofescapes.com/akron/quests/the-great-escape-room-akron-sherlock-holmes-library,0,Dr. Megan Watson helped us have a REALLY good time in the Library room. She explained to us what we were doing and was a pleasant presence during our adventure in trying to escape. No claustrophobia worries. Plenty of room to have fun and excitement as we used our brains.

We did Sherlock's Library. Our Dr. Watson (Katie) was so nice and helpful; she made it a lot of fun. I would definitely do this again. I do feel we would have had a better chance with 4-6 people (10 sounds a little crowded), so I would recommend bringing a few extra eyeballs."

We completed it with 3 people and the help of our guide. Madisyn was the best!
