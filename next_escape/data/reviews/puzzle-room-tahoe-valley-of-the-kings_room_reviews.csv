(ages 68-21) Each person participated in solving the hieroglyphics & puzzles. It took all of us, with under 5 minutes to spare. We'd have solved it 5 minutes sooner, but there was a short in one of the clues. It was actually a great highlight on our trip. Had so much fun, we purchased a package this summer in Texas so we can take his bother & wife as a ""thank-you"" gift for dog sitting. Their grandkid in high school may go with us, too. We will be back!"
