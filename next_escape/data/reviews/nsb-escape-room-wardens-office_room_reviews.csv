Our group had 4 adults, two teenagers and an 11 & 10-year-old. First time going and we get locked into The Warden's room. Didn't make it out in time but will definitely be going back to try again! Great prices and awesome staff. Something new and fun for all ages. Try it!"

It was difficult tasks that make you think and if you don't know something you have a guide to give you 3 hints (use them wisely). We had a blast, the guy was super nice and I would highly recommend because the business actually has several rooms so you can keep coming back!"

It keeps your mind going for sure. But that's what the game was about. I needed the guy from Prison Break there...lol, the people are super friendly and very helpful. It was a lot of fun."

Jim, the owner, was very nice and enthusiastic. Great atmosphere, the puzzles weren't too hard but not easy neither, which is a good thing lol that's the point. We did the Wardens Office and we are already making plans and soo excited to come back and try the other rooms! Thank you Jim!!!"
