Me and my boyfriend along with our two other friends did the Alcatraz Prison escape, I must say, IT WAS AWESOME. Required a lot of thinking out side the box (which was the point) but it's not like it was easy. Our group of 8 people finished with 3 minutes left! Even then I didn't think we'd make it. All of the staff was extremely nice. Jamie even took a picture of all of us to commemorate our success !! I would definitely recommend this it everyone I know (and I'm saying that honestly. It was a heck of a lot of fun!) the room was decorated perfectly and it made it even authentic. I will definitely be returning!!"
