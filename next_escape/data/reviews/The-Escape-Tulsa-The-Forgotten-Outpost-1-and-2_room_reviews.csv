"Escape room ""The Conquered Embassy"" by The Escape Tulsa in Tulsa",https://worldofescapes.com/tulsa/quests/The-Escape-Tulsa-The-Forgotten-Outpost-1-and-2,0,"We just enjoyed our first escape room experience and chose The Conquered Embassy because it has a low success rate ( 35% ). Our four family members worked like a well oiled machine and escaped in just over 38 minutes. We will definitely be back to try different rooms, this was a blast!"

The Conquered Embassy was our room of choice. It was hard!! We selected this room because it only has a 35% success rate and we had several experienced escape gamers. Sadly, we overestimated our ability. We loved the challenge and did solve most of the puzzle but not enough to escape. I highly recommend this place. Great staff and reasonable price for the experience."

Team reindeer escaped the room with 53 seconds to spare. Was a great team building activity! Staff is friendly & the room we were in was very interesting!"
