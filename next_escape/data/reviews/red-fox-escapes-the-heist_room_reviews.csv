"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Red Fox Escapes in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/red-fox-escapes-the-heist,0,We played The Heist while on a trip to Boston and it happened to be our 151st escape room! It was one of the best rooms we’ve experienced in the city. The owners were lovely and the room was a great challenge with a lot of interesting puzzles that we haven’t seen before. We would highly recommend Red Fox Escaped to any fellow enthusiasts!

Can't wait to go back when the second room (the submarine) is open later this year.

Our group really appreciated the care that went into every facet of the story -- all the clever and diverse puzzles, as well the ability to pair or split organically to tackle them in parallel. The experience was immersive, thoughtful, stylish, and just plain well done. Highly recommended!"
