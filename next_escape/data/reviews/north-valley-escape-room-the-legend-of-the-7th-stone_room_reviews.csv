"Escape room ""The Legend of the 7th Stone"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-the-legend-of-the-7th-stone,0,Had the pleasure of doing The Legend Of The 7th Stone and it was amazing!  Really one of the best escape rooms I have had the pleasure of experiencing.  Everything was top notch from the immersive theme to the helpful and energetic staff.  We made it out with a little more than 14 minutes to spare.  I honestly cannot wait to come back and try Great Outdoors!  Thanks for an amazing time!

I've done 2 of their rooms with my 8 year old son and both were challenging but FUN! We did The Principal's Office and The Legend of the 7th Stone. If you have kids hen you have to book the whole room but the flat rate to book it as a private room is reasonable. The staff has always been kind and friendly. We will definitely be back!
