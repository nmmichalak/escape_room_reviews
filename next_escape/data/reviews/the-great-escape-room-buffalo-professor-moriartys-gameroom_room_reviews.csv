"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/the-great-escape-room-buffalo-professor-moriartys-gameroom,0,"Would definitely recommend! I set up a private party for my birthday and the Location Manager, Karina, was SO helpful and accommodating to ensure that our group would have the best experience ever! Our event guide, Frank, was very patient and supportive during our attempts to escape. It was great to all work together to find clues and and play off each other's skills to solve the puzzles. We participated in Moriatry's Gameroom and fell about 30sec short of making it out. I would definitely return to The Great Escape Room for another event!!!! Two thumbs up! "

The clues were awesome and our game master Frank was very helpful and nice to us! I highly recommend this for anyone who has done escape rooms before because this is a bit challenging for beginners. Awesome time, will definitely be back"
