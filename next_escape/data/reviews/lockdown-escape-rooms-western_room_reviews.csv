We tried the Western room and came *THIS* close to victory, but were thwarted by an oversight on some simpler puzzles. Loved it, definitely coming back to try the Science room soon!"

The Western Room was so funny and just perfect for our first ever escape room. Definitely stimulates teamwork. We were so excited solving each puzzle! We can't wait to book the Voodoo room next.

It was a great experience each time, and the Western theme was my favorite. The decorations are really good and authentic and add to the story. Lisa did an awesome job greeting us, getting us ready, and helping us when we got stumped. Highly recommend!"
