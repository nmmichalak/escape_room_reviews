"Escape room ""Checkmate"" by No Escape in Ithaca",https://worldofescapes.com/ithaca/quests/no-escape-checkmate,0,"I have done some escape rooms in NY, but this one was the best. I had a group of 5, and it was a perfect way to finish our evening in our weekend trip upstate. Everything is really well thought and it was super fun. Good story and good puzzles. I totally recommend it!  "
"Escape room ""Checkmate"" by No Escape in Ithaca",https://worldofescapes.com/ithaca/quests/no-escape-checkmate,1,"This room was an absolute blast. You can tell he spent a lot of time and thought not only in the creation of the mechanical and electrical components, but the story line as well. It was more fun and more interesting than a lot of businesses I've been to that specialize in escape rooms. Great job! Thanks for a fun afternoon!"
