I knew my group had to try and beat the odds of this 18% escape rate! No need to ask...we did it! So fun. Always remember to think outside the box! Great staff and fun!

The 8 of us did the Game room and we (barely) escaped! Max was fun and kept things interesting and us guessing. I think I could do the same room again and not be able to remember half of the twists and turns. Looking forward to doing the other rooms!
