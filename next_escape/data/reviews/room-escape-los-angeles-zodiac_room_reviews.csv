I volunteered to be the first victim in, and was rewarded by being handcuffed down. Be warned there's a lot of blood and it has a definite creep factor. These puzzles were not as challenging mentally, but because of the handcuffs and clear physical limitations, proved to be pretty difficult to finally escape. "

I would definitely recommenced it if you like horror and scary and interactive! I was thoroughly impressed by this room and the puzzles involved! Also our game master Danny was so funny and sweet and cute! I cannot wait to come back and do their other rooms!
