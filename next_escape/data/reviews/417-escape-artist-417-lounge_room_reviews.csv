"Escape room ""417 Lounge"" by 417 Escape Artist in Springfield (MO)",https://worldofescapes.com/springfield-mo/quests/417-escape-artist-417-lounge,0,"This was my first experience (and my friend's) with an escape room. We weren't totally sure what to expect, but had the best time! We did the 417 Lounge and it was the perfect room to start out. The clues were fun and interesting. Challenging enough, but not so much that we got frustrated. The staff was really friendly, and explained everything really well. We will definitely be back for more escape rooms!"

The girls used great communication and worked together and we escaped 417 Lounge. We canâ€™t wait to go back and try the other rooms.
