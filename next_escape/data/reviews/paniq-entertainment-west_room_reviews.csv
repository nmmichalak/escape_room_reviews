"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,0,"The room was pretty well done although I thought it was a little too dark. We did have a flashlight and a lantern, though. The puzzles were a little too easy (all of us had only done one or two rooms before). I wish the timer appeared in all of the rooms, but it was only visible in the first room. We could only communicate to the game master through a walkie talkie, which was unexpected. Sometimes it was a little challenging to understand them. I think the room used its space well, and we only ever felt too crowded in the first room (with 6 people). We did end up finishing with over 20 minutes. I think everyone still had a good time. "
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,1,We did the Wild West room on a double date and it was so much fun! We were talking about it the rest of the weekend. We can't wait to go back and try another challenge.
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,2,"THIS WAS AWESOME! My husband, mom (visiting from out of town) and I did this on a free evening we had together because we had all heard of escape the rooms and wanted to do one. We wanted to do this as a bonding activity but also because all three of us enjoy good challenges. Typically, my mom and my husband are competitive and I'm the one telling everyone ""it's only a game, calm down!"" However, by the end, I was cursing (I don't curse) and getting frustrated as a completive side I never see in myself was coming out. We failed the room, going over our 60 minute time by 3 minutes or so. It IS challenging doing the room with only 3 people (as it says on their website) partially because there were times when my husband and mother were solving a clue in one part of the room and meanwhile I was trying to solve a clue on my own in the other corner. Time is of the essence and the more minds working together, the better. However, it is by no means impossible to do this with only two or three people.We did the Wild West room and we felt like this was a good challenge level for us since this is our first escape room (we've heard that at PanIQ, the Kidnapping room is the most challenging with the Alien room being a close second). We would have finished the room in time (I imagine) but we didn't realize it was ""okay"" to ask for hints. Although the lovely woman working there told us we could, we figured that a) that was ""cheating"" and b) we were going to escape this room ourselves, gosh dernit! In the future, we will phone in a few times and ask for hints...! So again, this location is not ""too tough"" to complete as some other puzzle rooms I've seen reviews of in the Phoenix area. They want you to have fun! We will definitely be coming back with more family and friends in the future. It was SUCH a blast! We will be talking about this for a long time afterward."
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,3,Sooooo much fun. Got locked up in the Wild West room with my brothers and dad (all adults) and it was challenging enough to make it entertaining but not so challenging that we were frustrated. Can't wait to go back and try another room.
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,4,"What a unique experience. My brother got locked up with his wife (a great idea, btw), and I got to save her (and him). Da da da da! We were the heroes! We asked if we could leave him, but just like the forest: ""Pack it in, pack it out...don't litter"". The staff was friendly and considerate. We needed a LOT of clues! It really requires community and communiction-which the world needs more of. It was good, wholesome, and great fun. Thanks, PANIQ Room Phx!!!"

It was myself (adult) and four teenagers and it was challenging enough for all of us but tons of fun!! We can't wait to come back and try the other rooms! Plus, the staff was awesome! Thank you for a fun experience!!!!! Hope to see you guys again soon!!"
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,6,"Have done 2 of the 3 rooms, Kidnapping and Wild West. Went thru the Kidnapping room with my family and friends (5 of us) and came out with a few minutes to spare. Wild West one went thru with my coworkers (6) for team building and we end up going way over our time. Everyone had a blast and was talking about how they wanted to do the other rooms with their other friends and family. I will most definitely be going back to do the Alien room."
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,7,"First time doing a panic room. We went with a group of 6 friends. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about being locked in a room for an hour, but it was a lot of fun working together to escape with only our own ingenuity. The time seem to pass quickly as we were racing the against the clock to solve the series of puzzles that would enable us to escape. I thought it was great! Especially with friends. Would be fun to do with a group of friends, family or team building for work. Grab a coupon and go check it out. Now I want to try all the rooms!"
