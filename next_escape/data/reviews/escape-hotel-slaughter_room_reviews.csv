"Escape room ""Slaughter"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-slaughter,0,"So much fun! My boyfriend and I stumbled across the Hotel when a zombie slammed her face against the window we were casually walking past. Definitely got our attention and we went right on in. We joined two strangers in the Slaughter House. We were blindfolded and handcuffed to the floor and WOW, thankfully we worked well with the other two guys. This is definitely a team effort. No way you could do this on your own. We almost made it to the end but ""died"" right before the end. All in all it was a great experience. We will be going again."

The beginning felt like a flashback of Saw! I was so excited my heart was beating... The front desk hostess was very hospitalble, and the caf√© hostess was very cool and served us all a very delicious drink to get our energy up while we waited for the serial killer. Overall a great experience we definitely will be back in the upcomong weeks."
