We have a lot of friends who live out of town, or who've never done the escape rooms before, and the first thing we suggest as a great hangout/bonding experience is to go try and beat a Jackson Escape Room! We've also been paired with complete strangers in an escape room before, and got to know them as we worked together to get out. Great experience!"
