We had a personalized experience and felt like valued customers which is rare these days. The Diamond Heist was incredibly challenging, but we did it. We will definitely make the trek back to Melbourne just to experience the other rooms. We will also bring family and friends as it is awesome. Thank you Escape Zone!"
"Escape room ""Diamond Heist"" by Escape Room Entertainment in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/the-escape-zone-diamond-heist,1,This was an amazing first experience. The staff was very friendly. I have been talking about how much fun it was since last night. I'm bringing my daughter to do the diamond heist. My heart was pounding as we entered the room where Oliva was murdered. It was like a real crime scene. Blood and a dead body outline. Lots of neat accessories. Very well crafted and thought out.
