"Escape room ""Sherlock's Study"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Exodus-Escape-Room-Sherlocks-Study,2,My group did the Sherlock room and it was a lot of fun! We had nine people which was a little bit of a crowd. The only problem that we had was that the finally lock was difficult to open and keep us from getting out in the hour. They did give us more time though because they knew that we had the code. My family is really excited to do this again though!
