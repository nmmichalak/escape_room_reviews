"Escape room ""Creature Room 2016"" by Escape Challenge in Rochester (MN)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester-mn/quests/escape-challenge-creature-room-2016,0,My father in law was not too keen on the idea but reluctantly we convinced him to come with. We were greeted by an excellent staff and had a wonderful and challenging time with the Creature Room. Finally after making it in and just completing with 4 seconds to spare we escaped and nothing was more gratifying than seeing the smile on my father-in-law's face. We all had a wonderful time and I would strongly recommend to anyone to please check this place out you will not be dissapointed!
