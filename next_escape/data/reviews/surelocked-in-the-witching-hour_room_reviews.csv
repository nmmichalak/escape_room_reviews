"Escape room ""The Witching Hour"" by Surelocked In in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/surelocked-in-the-witching-hour,0,Amazing! We did the Witching Hour the day it opened and were the 3rd group ever to do the room (apparently we got the furthest woohoo!). We failed to find the witch's heart but it was SO much fun. I can't wait to go back and try it again now that I've got some experience under my belt.

We were unsuccessful in completing our mission but were told by Chris for it being our first escape room and attempting the hardest room, we did fantastic! Loved every minute of it! They have done an amazing job designing these rooms. We will be back!"
