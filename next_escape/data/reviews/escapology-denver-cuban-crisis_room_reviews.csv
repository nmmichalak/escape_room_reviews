"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-cuban-crisis,0,team building exercise with colleagues and it was the first time doing an escape room for most of us. We had such a great time. The lady administering the room and keeping an eye on us recognized when we were really struggling and provided clues when she knew we were at a loss. We managed the escape the room and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other rooms!

Food was better than expected, ambience is great.  We did the Cuban Crisis and while I'd like it to be a bit more difficult, some of the puzzles were tricky.  I'll definitely be back to try a tougher room."

Lunch afterwards was tasty and fun. Good variety of food choices."
