"Escape room ""Train Robbery"" by Cyber Raccoon Escape Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/cyber-raccoon-escape-room-dc-train-robbery,1,"We had a team bonding activity with my colleagues and loved it very much! At the beginning you just walk around and explore the gaming room. Once you find your first clue, you just follow the series of puzzles. They are connected to each other and it helps you to understand what is your next step. The game masters watch you during the whole time and will give hints only if you ask for them.  We asked for 2 clues because we did not want to lose our time. If you like brain teasers and mysteries, definitely try this place!  "
