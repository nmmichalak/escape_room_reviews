"Escape room ""FDR Bunker II"" by Evergreen Fun Park in Park Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/park-rapids/quests/Evergreen-Gifts-And-Fun-Bunker-Escape-Room,1,"I have done 5 escape rooms in various cities, and the FDR room is absolutely one of the best. The attention to detail is excellent. The room is not too easy, and not too difficult. 6 of us escaped with ten minutes to spare. Absolutely worth the money to spend an hour escaping here!"
