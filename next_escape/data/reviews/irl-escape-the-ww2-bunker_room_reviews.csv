"Escape room ""The WW2 Bunker"" by IRL Escape in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/irl-escape-the-ww2-bunker,1,Very fun experience. The room was a great challenge with very cool and fun puzzles that were all fitting to the theme and timeline. The puzzles were very well thought out and used some very interesting technologies from WWII to tie everything together. I am looking forward to try their new rooms in the future!
"Escape room ""The WW2 Bunker"" by IRL Escape in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/irl-escape-the-ww2-bunker,2,IRL is a new escape room but has put together a nice WWII bunker themed room. The operator is very passionate about his facility and clearly takes pride in keeping it operational. Nicely done. We will return when his second room is complete.
"Escape room ""The WW2 Bunker"" by IRL Escape in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/irl-escape-the-ww2-bunker,3,The thrill of escaping and figuring out all the clues was definitely top notch at IRL Escape. When my sisters and I arrived we were welcomed and instructed on what to do and then let into the escape room. Everything from the sounds to the objects and wall decor was accurate to the time of the story. The clues were challenging but not so difficult we couldn't get them. The owner helped us along and made sure that we got all the clues. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the World War II Escape Room. Thank you to Travis for wonderful adventure!

I loved the puzzles and the theme of WWII. The room had a really creative layout and pattern of the clues and puzzles. Staff was helpful, inviting, and encouraging. Loved how the room was historically correct and authentic. Definitely recommend. Over all very well executed on the staff's end, and a great experience."
