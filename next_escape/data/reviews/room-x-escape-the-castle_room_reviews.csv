"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Room X Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/room-x-escape-the-castle,0,"Visited Room X Escape for a work team outing and had a really great time. The puzzles are ingenious, the progression is exciting, and the feeling of fulfillment upon finishing before the time runs out was very tangible. Highly recommended!"
"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Room X Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/room-x-escape-the-castle,1,"So much fun! I did the Castle one with a group of 13 and at no point did I think I was in a real castle (obviously a room with wallpaper, and the ""books on the shelf"" were made of cardstock) but the puzzles were very unique and challenging. I would give it 5 stars for the game, phone service, and person guiding us, but I wish it had felt more castle-y."

The guy who introduced the experience was fun. The escape room was full of twists and surprises. And we actually solved the puzzle, but with just a few minutes to spare. Highly recommended!"
