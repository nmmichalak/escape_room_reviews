"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,0,"We tried the game titled ""The Lost Expedition"" which was rated medium-hard as far as it's level of difficulty. Without giving anything away, we'll say that it's a lot different than what you're used to, and has a lot of parts to solving which will make your team think outside the box, communicate well, but this particular Escape Room had a particularly good ""flow"" as you progress through the room. We will say that the actual room used for the puzzle, are well thought out, Jason was a great host, and we all agree that this Escape Room is one of our Top 5 favorites we've ever tried. Not because we solved it, but because it was VERY fun to do! Have you ever done an Escape Room where it's a lock defeating puzzle and all you managed to do was open 15+ locks? Well, this Escape Room is far from that, and was really really interesting. Give Steal and Escape a try! We think you'll like their games A LOT! Steal and Escape's experiences cost $32/person, but we also think it was time very well spent in our humble opinion."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,1,"So I actually ran The Lost Expedition as my first escape room ever on December 19, and while I thought I had done a bunch of research ahead of time on how escape rooms work and what to expect, this room subverted my expectations and set up a tough standard for future rooms I would do.Everything in the room is user-activated (really heavy arduino use), and one of the mechanics of the room actually gives the players more agency in their experience. There are no traditional padlocks or number pads. There is a critical path for the players to follow, but non-linear encounters line that path. Certain players have roles defined in the context of the game that provide a natural kick to encourage participation and communication, and I feel like that's really clever and probably doesn't get enough credit.Jason is a great game master and clearly has the experience to know when and how to nudge versus hint, and crafted an experience for our group that felt appropriately challenging, but never frustrating. My first experience with an escape room just happened to be this one, and it was so great that I was motivated to visit a different facility on the same night. The only bummer here is that so much heart and soul has to go into the creation of each room that I don't want to come back too soon, because once I play Mysterious Stranger I'm going to have to wait until the next room is released."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,2,"My group and I completed The Lost Expedition and HIGHLY recommend this company and room! For my birthday my group and I decided to do an escape room crawl in San Diego and this was our first stop. Not only is this room very immersive, the staff is also extremely nice.We originally were supposed to have four people playing this room, but plans changed and could only do it with three. Instead of turning us away and saying that we couldn't do the room, the two gentlemen working just came in at one point to help us with the one puzzle that required four people. Without giving too much away, the room begins with everyone being assigned a role that will help you in completing the room. I really liked this idea because it ensures that everyone gets to be involved in the room, instead of just have a few players steamroll everyone else. The team elements that are required to escape really add to the experience in my opinion.The other major difference with this room is that it isn't your traditional 60 minute room. It's all dependent on the choices you make throughout the game how long it will last. Your time could end in 20 minutes, or it can end in two hours. We will definitely be back next time we're in San Diego to do their other room, and can't wait to see what this company has in store for the future!"
