"Escape room ""The Row"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-the-row,0,"A friend brought me here and we had an absolute blast doing the ""Death Row"" scenario. It ended up being just the two of us doing the scenario (and on a Friday night) which was kinda fun just working through it as the two of us. The staff was friendly, professional, and helpful. We're looking forward to going back again."

I was in charge of date night and didn't want to sit through dinner and a movie again. So we tried this place out. My husband and I had to escape death row and we where given an hour to do it. They have several other other themed rooms as well. Both my husband and I had a great time, the rooms are designed with a larger group of people in mind though. I've recommended this place to a lot of friends because it was so fun, I can't wait to try the other rooms!"
