"Escape room ""Dean's Diner Disaster"" by Escape Rooms Unlocked in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-rooms-unlocked-deans-diner-disaster,0,We did Deans diner room and it was a blast. I went with my people 20 to 50+ and even my dad who usually stays home while the rest of us go off thought it was fun. We were all able to figure out different clues and work together to finish the mission.

We found Dean's Diner to be perfect for us newbies as we had no idea what to expect. The room had enough challenge, but was solvable with team work. The staff was very helpful and friendly and I would recommend this activity for a group of all ages."
"Escape room ""Dean's Diner Disaster"" by Escape Rooms Unlocked in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-rooms-unlocked-deans-diner-disaster,2,"We had never done this before so we kind of came into it blind. Group of 3 of us did Dean's Disaster room. We did not finish we ran out of time. If we probably had about another 30 minutes we might have been able. He told us we were about 60 to 70 percent complete. We had to use all 3 clues. I don't want to give away anything from the room, so I will just say we had a great time and will be doing this again soon. Staff is very helpful and explains everything."
