"Escape room ""Henchmen's Hideout"" by Puzzlemental Escape Room Adventures in St. Joseph (MI)",https://worldofescapes.com/st-joseph-mi/quests/puzzlemental-henchmens-hideout,0,"Was my first time with an escape room. The group of friends I went with included six people total. We attempted the Al Capone themed room. Was most definitely a fun-filled experience. I would highly recommend this escape room location! Staff was kind and professional. The location is great, and the set-up of the business inside is done very well. Talking with staff, they are planning more-new experiences within. Check this place out!"
