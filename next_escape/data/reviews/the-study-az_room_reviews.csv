"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Sleuth Box in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-study-az,0,"Wow! A Hidden Gem of an Escape Room! My husband and I have done over 20 escape rooms, and we must say that this is our new favorite room. Megan did a great job as our cluemaster. We were lucky enough to do this room on our own which we prefer. (Too many cooks...and all that). This room had all sorts of unique puzzles and lots of good old-fashioned locks. And lots and lots of books, of course. This franchise allows you to take as long as you need to finish the game, which is always appreciated. We can't wait for their new room to open! If you like escape rooms, put this room at the top of your ""must-do"" list. You won't be disappointed."
"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Sleuth Box in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-study-az,1,"I've never had the opportunity to play an Escape Game before, but I'm glad my first experience was at the Sleuth Box!I don't want to give too much away, but every little detail was on point. From the look and feel of the room to the clues themselves, everything was done with attention to the finest detail.My co-workers and I who worked to solve the puzzle talked about our experience well after we were done and we are definitely eager to go back when the next room is available. Hey, we may even want to come back to solve the first puzzle since it was so much fun!A+ experience and would highly recommend to others!"
"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Sleuth Box in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-study-az,2,"This was my first experience at an escape room, and I have to say, The Sleuth Box set the bar high!! It was such a fun experience, and so different from anything I've done before. The room was incredibly detailed, and the mystery was intriguing and challenging. I'd recommend this for a date night, or with a group of friends or family. I can't wait to go back when they open their second room."

The men in our group, of course did not want to go, and of course we made them! After we were done they started talking about attending another in our home town, that is how much fun we had. We all worked together and were able to get out. We were surprised how we all came together and worked so well! This establishment is recommended to everyone. This was our first experience and now we can't wait for the second."
"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Sleuth Box in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-study-az,4,"My experience here over the weekend was phenomenal and my family is still raving about this a few days later.  And this wasn't my first escape room, and I *thought* the other one was pretty good...The room was so richly appointed and well decorated, to the point that it becomes an immersion experience.  And the puzzles were challenging and engaging, but not so ridiculous that no sane person could ever conceivably ever reach that end conclusion on their own accord.  Plus, there are a couple of bonus action items in the game that made our group exclaim in delight and surprise!  This was an extremely well thought out room and a completely delightful way to spend an hour.  I will return and I can't wait until they open another room!"
"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Sleuth Box in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-study-az,5,"My family took me here for my birthday this past year, and we had a blast escaping the Sleuth Box!  There's only one room right now, but it was so intricate and fun that I know the Cabin In The Woods (the room they're currently developing) is going to be a huge hit.  The Sleuth Box and Escape Zone AZ are probably my favorite two escape businesses I've visited so far, in regards to the atmosphere, the details of the puzzles, and how they're incorporated into the room.  I felt like I was Sherlock Holmes!"
