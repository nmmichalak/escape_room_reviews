"Escape room ""The Bistro"" by Escape The Post in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-the-post-the-bistro,2,We decided to try it out for my birthday! I'm pregnant so I figured it would be a fun family event. There was 6 of us and we did the Bistro. We had a blast! We even solved the mystery. We won a free admission since we solved it. I'd do it again!
