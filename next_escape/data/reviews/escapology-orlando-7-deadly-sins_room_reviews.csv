"Escape room ""7 Deadly Sins"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-7-deadly-sins,0,"Fun, exciting, and challenging rooms with a great variety of adventures to choose from, AND friendly, helpful, and witty game masters. I'm terrible with names, but I remember our gamemaster Matt was fantastic! Scott, Sierra, Dave, and everyone else whose name I forgot (sorry), were also awesome and made our experience that much better! I really wish we didn't live so far away, because there's still more rooms to do. We'll be back for sure! Thanks, everyone!"

Super friendly and even let us book over the phone and pay when we arrived. Checking in was easy and there's plenty of games to keep you busy while you wait. Game master was also super friendly and super helpful.Me and 3 other friends did the seven deadly sins room and it was very well done. Theme and decorations were great and the storyline continues throughout the entire room. We weren't able to finish the room in time but the game master was nice enough to take us through the rest of the room. Also if you're easily scared you should be fine to do the room, I'm a chicken and I found the only thing that really scared me was the smoke machine turning on.Just keep in mind that if you decide to do this room it's fairly difficult, 3/4 people in our group have done escape rooms in the past and we needed a lot of help. Also the rooms are fairly tiny, so I recommend keeping your group to about 4 or less people."
