"Escape room ""Bloody Mary"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-bloody-mary,0,Iâ€™ve done three different rooms at different places. This one was BY FAR the best! We had a blast in the Bloody Mary room.
"Escape room ""Bloody Mary"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-bloody-mary,1,This was my first time doing an escape room and it was great!  It was challenging and fun to solve the riddles.  We did Bloody Mary and the Asylum and they were both scary and fun!  This is a great team activity and the owners are awesome.  Kim helped guide us how to start and made us feel very welcome.  Can't wait to go back and try other rooms.  They said they are always changing things up to make it a different experience every time.  She was also telling us about the kid friendly room to come back and do with the little ones.  Thank you for giving us an experience we will never forget!

If you have to choose between these 2 rooms I would choose bloody Mary. Both rooms were very well decorated to get you into the theme. The game master we had was great, he helped us just enough to finish with only seconds left to spare. The bloody Mary room had many electromagnetic locks which I always love."
