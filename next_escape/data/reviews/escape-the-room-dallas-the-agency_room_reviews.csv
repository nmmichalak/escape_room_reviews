"Escape room ""Agency"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-the-agency,0,"Pretty good room and friendly staff. I did the Agency and completed the room. Some pretty hard puzzles which is good but definitely got way too make ""clues"". We weren't left alone enough to really be immersed into the room but rather it felt like I had training wheels on the whole time even getting prompts from the screen on things we already did. For beginners that might not be a bad thing but didn't enjoy it myself and wouldn't recommend if you have done an escape room before. I wouldn't go back."

The staff is great, and friendly. They really make the experience better. I've successfully completed The Dig, and the Agency. I'm looking forward to the Western Bank Heist. I highly recommend this Escape The Room."

I have done an escape room before and Escape The Room Dallas is top notch. The game was challenging and drew you in. Judd, our game host, did an outstanding job with the clues and keeping us energized. We were able to beat The Agency with only 30 seconds to spare. It was exciting right to the very end! Would recommend to anyone who likes excitement and fun! Thanks guys. We will be back again soon."
