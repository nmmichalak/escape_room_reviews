I did the two person game called, chained. It was a good balance of challenging and rewarding. Entrance is cool as well, that's where the puzzles start. We solved the bonus puzzle and the overall puzzle. Staff is very friendly and go over the initial instructions very well.  Everything was super clean and sanitized, which was visually evident and communicated by the staff. They offered gloves as well. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a good escape room experience. They're ""number 1"" for a reason. Haha"

We really enjoyed Chained and actually escaped! We’ll be going back the next time that my son visits. It’s so great to spend an hour working together without being distracted by the phone or social media.
