"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Newport News in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/breakout-games-newport-news-hostage,1,"This was our very first escape room ever and we had a blast. We did ""hostage"" and while we had no idea where to begin we eventually got the hang of it and managed to get out in about 47 mins! Really interesting use of old and new tools and technologies to make the experience super fun. Our game master Darryl didn't go super easy on us but was always there if we were super stuck and needed a clue. Go on a Sunday or a weekday! We were the only people there. Well worth the money and a fabulous date night idea."
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Newport News in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/breakout-games-newport-news-hostage,2,We just finished the Hostage game at Breakout. We had a great time. Definitely have to be quick with figuring out the clues. Matt the game master was very helpful with game hints. We did pretty well for two people. Will definitely go back to try other games.

The facilities are extremely clean and organized, and the staff was super friendly and helpful. We chose the Hostage room and were joined by two other people. I love how the room gives everyone a common goal that allows you to get to know one another, even if you've never met. The room was filled with so many twist, tricks, and turns and was a blast to solve. We made it out with just 6 minutes to spare so you definitely get your money's worth of time. Overall I recommend that you go and experience Breakout Games' facility. You will not be disappointed!"
