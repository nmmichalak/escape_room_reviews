We did the mob hit in the art gallery and finished with 39 seconds left. The clues were hard but not impossible, and it was really exciting. The hint system is pretty good (we used a couple at the end); you can do it without help or ask for one if you think you need it. Great fun, well done with the room and mystery."

We escaped in about 35 minutes, but not without a little extra help with clues. It was definitely a challenge-but a good one, for sure. Will definitely go again to try out the other rooms, and they have plans for expansion many times over."

My friends and I had a great time doing the Moonlight Gallery experience and we managed to finish in a half an hour with no hints. The puzzles were challenging, but not too frustrating or difficult. If you're on the fence, take a chance and go! You won't regret it."
