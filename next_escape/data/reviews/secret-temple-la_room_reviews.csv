"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,0,This was a lot of fun! Definitely want to come back for the Crime Scene Room.
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,1,Great time with visiting Family from Oklahoma. We did good.
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,2,"Done a number of Escape Rooms in LA & this one beat them all! We did The Temple and the room was clean, everything worked properly, clues were HIGH QUALITY and the story was fun! Even more so, the lady who sets up the group for the room was a great storyteller and did a great job of setting the atmosphere before we even started. We are going back again this weekend to try their next room!"
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,3,"I did the Secret Temple room with 7 other people for a friends bday party.  It was $25 each.  It was definitely a fun activity, but it wasn't as logic, puzzle-solving centered as I expected.  There was more trial and error and a little randomness involved.The man and woman that greeted us were fun, nice and engaging.  The guy continued on to monitor us in the room and was helpful (with clues) when we needed it.  Obviously this whole operation was set up and is run by some fun & creative people.  I see in some of the other reviews people mentioning an actress, but maybe we didn't get that far?!  I would definitely try a different room or other escape activity but didn't love this one.  It was a little more frustrating than it was fun in retrospect because I think that specific puzzle needed a main clue to bind all the random stuff together (maybe as a hint, they could reveal another framed clue that would give you an idea of what move you need first instead of the monitor giving verbal clues).  I'm not going into any detail so as not to give anything away.I also think a few details would make the room aesthetically a lot more cooler and make you feel like you are actually in a secret temple room.  There was laminating (which I get makes things last longer but just printing out new little papers seems worth it to heighten the experience) and labels/stickers that kind of took you right out of the secret temple and into Staples. lol.  I'd rate this experience a 3.5 but since everyone else's reviews are so high and it was worth trying, I don't want to lowball!  I'm curious to try the Apt. 205 room since people seem to love that one!"
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,4,Writing this review after our second visit to this amazing escape room! It all starts with the awesome staff! They really have gone the extra mile to intelligently design the rooms. Loved the exciting twists and turns while keeping to the theme from start to finish. On our first visit we were not able to solve The Secret Temple - it left us scratching our heads and more determined to complete a room. We came back to try Apartment 205 and solved it. We had so much fun we had to try the Temple again... Second time was a charm and we were able to solve it too... with clues from the secret society of course ;-) we can't wait for room three. We will be back again! Enigma Escape Rooms makes for a fun night with friends! Six thumbs up!
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,5,"Awesome experience! I think it's very unique although i've only been to the Exit game. But reading all the reviews, this would be one of the top.This experience is for sure worth it. Me and my co-workers have tried the Secret Temple, and Boy, our mind was boggled! They really put a lot of effort and thought with the puzzles and combinations. Lots and lots of surprises.I love how they have a narrator with you who's a really good actress. You can ask for a hint which i suggest, would be really helpful to get out.Online booking was great, they have a really good website, easy to navigate and great price! Parking is not bad, you have a few parking space at the back of the building. Great Area, and i love the interior setting. Can't wait to try Apartment 205!!!"
