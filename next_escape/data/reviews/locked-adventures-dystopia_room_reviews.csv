"Escape room ""Dystopia"" by Locked Adventures in San Marcos (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/san-marcos-ca/quests/locked-adventures-dystopia,0,"This escape room definitely exceeded my expectations. Me and my best friend spontaneously decided to do an escape room with our younger sisters so it was just us four, but we managed to escape!!! I have done many scary themed escape rooms, but this one really did bring my adrenaline up pretty high. I would definitely recommend this escape room, especially when youâ€™re into the more thrill-seeking escape rooms. "
