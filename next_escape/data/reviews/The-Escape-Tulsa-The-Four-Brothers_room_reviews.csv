It was challenging, but not too challenging. The staff was friendly. We enjoyed it so much, we booked Area 405 for next weekend. It was way better than we anticipated!! Definitely recommend."

It took some brainstorming but we were able to escape and we had so much fun in the process. They were professional and easy to work with. I needed to reschedule the room after I had booked it and they made it easy. They gave us fair warning that some of the other rooms won't be as challenging as this one was, but I will still look forward to trying them!"

We really enjoyed the excitement and stress. Everyone did some part and helped find clues. It was really fun and we plan to return. Oh, and we solved ""The Lost Antidote""!"
