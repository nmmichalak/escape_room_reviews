"Escape room ""The Pharaoh's Tomb"" by The Escape Room in South Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/south-portland/quests/the-escape-room-maine-the-pharaohs-tomb,0,We went last night for my birthday and did the Pharaohs room. We made it out with 20 minutes to spare. We had an absolute blast and are already planning our next room!

Trevor, our game master, was very friendly and energetic. The place was very dapper, clean, and was an overall welcoming atmosphere. My group of eight chose the Egyptian tomb. Absolutely stellar! The puzzles were well planned and although it was fairly difficult at times, it was so much fun and encouraged awesome teamwork amongst my group. It's definitely a fun group event or even just to do with a few friends. I highly recommend this place!"
