This place is so easy to get to from the strip. The entry room is clean and professional.We did the cursed cabin and I won't give any hints, but this place is so much fun. It was perfectly challenging, got stuck a couple times but they gave us good hints so that we could get through it.We are going to come back and try the other two rooms when we have more time!"
"Escape room ""Cursed Cabin"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-cursed-cabin,1,We went with a group of 5 for Cursed Cabin. Several teammates had been to similar escape rooms before and still enjoyed this one. It was great team building and overall fun.
"Escape room ""Cursed Cabin"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-cursed-cabin,2,We just played the Cursed Cabin. A great use of a small space. There were three of us which seemed about right since we did escape - barely (and using 3 hints).  I think two people would find it very difficult. 4-5 is about right probably.

Tyler and Jordan were awesome and helpful hosts. We hit several surprises that kept us guessing, and it felt so good to emerge victorious!"
