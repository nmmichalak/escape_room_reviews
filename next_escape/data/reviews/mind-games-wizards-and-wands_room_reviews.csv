"Escape room ""Wizards and Wands"" by Mind Games in Roseau",https://worldofescapes.com/roseau/quests/mind-games-wizards-and-wands,0,We had a group of people from ages 8 into adulthood and did the Wands and Wizards room. We did not find the sorting hat in time but we had a blast! The people who ran this place were very friendly and professional. I can't wait until I can come back and try another room!
