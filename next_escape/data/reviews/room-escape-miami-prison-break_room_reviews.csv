"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Room Escape Miami by Fox in a Box in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/room-escape-miami-prison-break,0,"Terrible venue. They start the clock exactly on the hour and end the room exactly on the hour. Get caught in a Florida thunderstorm while driving an hour to visit the venue? Too bad, you lose 10 minutes. The hour is up and you're literally 5 minutes from finishing the room? Too bad, you need to stop playing immediately even if they don't have another group scheduled after you."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Room Escape Miami by Fox in a Box in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/room-escape-miami-prison-break,1,"Laughable is a good way to describe this business. I was trying to surprise my girlfriend for a birthday date and was surprised to see that this Escape Room charged $70/person. I thought to myself, that's quite expensive. So I had written a review about how expensive it was and the manager responded saying they NEVER charge $75 a person. The picture I have clearly shows 2 people for $141, I guess it's not $75 but still close. They then had written to me and discussed why it was that expensive. Mind you I'm a paying customer. I had already bought the experience even though it was expensive, I had found a cheaper option. However, they did not care if I paid or not. They just kept saying bring more people and it's cheaper per person. Okay, so bring you more money makes it cheaper, I guess that makes sense.I asked if a refund was possible, they said no all sales are final.So I ask if I can add two more people and to charge my card. They respond saying you booked the room and it fits 7 people, when I get there I can pay for the rest. I said ok. And was just waiting till the day of the experience. Couple days go by and all of a sudden I get an email saying I'm being denied service for my malicious intent. All I did was point out how expensive it was.So I asked for a refund and they say they can't and DEMANDED to have my address to send me a check. There's a couple things wrong with this:1. Were in the 21st century, we've figured out how to refund people's credit cards.2. Asking for my address to send a check? That sounds fishy. Almost like they want to avoid the refund in the system to not look bad.I did not want to provide my address to a business that has taken a paying customers money and has now refused the service. So they said too bad. If you want, there's a check here waiting for you or you can cancel through your bank.Doesn't seem like good customer service to me.I had asked why she was being so unprofessional and she just kept saying I was a liability.I'm a liability for writing a review based off there pricing.As funny and as ridiculous as this story may seem, it's true. I honestly couldn't believe the service received as a paying customer. I knew the prices were high but still took decided to pay it to surprise my girlfriend for her birthday. And instead of the manager thinking of changing my mind and providing a great experience to change my review down the road about price, I'm harassed and denied entry. That's the last time I ever spend a penny at this place. Now I have to dispute through my bank this ridiculous charge because they refuse to refund me the normal way."

I forgot that it was just a game right from the beginning! Prison robes, actual authentic jail bars, music and decorations all add up to making it a great experience. We couldn't stop talking about it for a few days after! And yes, we escaped!! I definitely want to go back and try the others. It was my first time doing this and it certainly won't be my last!"
