We've done a few different types of escape the rooms in Tempe and Scottsdale but this was by far the best!Both the knight and rook/vegas rooms were tough and constantly had us moving around trying to get ourselves out. We were very happy the limit is 6 people, so our group of 4 was the only party booked when we went. I was impressed with the attention to detail and different types of obstacles we had to face in each room. We barely made it out of the second room it was intense!Awesome staff - looking forward to seeing the new rooms they open!"
