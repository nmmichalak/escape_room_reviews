"Escape room ""Laboratory of Biohazard"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omescape-laboratory-of-biohazard,0,"Wish we had more than just 2 of us for the Biohazard Laboratory room, but we had a great time and I would highly recommend this place and go back for the other rooms! This was my third room ever so far and it was awesome due to the production value, cleverness of puzzles, and it was all electrical/technological which was the first for me. Go check them out!"
"Escape room ""Laboratory of Biohazard"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omescape-laboratory-of-biohazard,1,"My friend and I had so much fun here! We were both new to the whole escape the room experience but were dying to try it out for a while. We did the biohazard laboratory room, which accommodates up to eight people, with a recommended group size of four to six. When we arrived, we were told another group of five people had also signed up to do the room. However, when that group came in and heard they wouldn't have the room to themselves, they asked if they could switch to another room for a private game since the other room was completely empty. This left my friend and me (two noobs) on our own to figure out the game for ourselves. I was a bit worried that our lack of manpower might be our downfall, but we managed to get some momentum going and successfully escape with only two minutes to spare! Not only would I come back to OMEscape to do another room, but I am already planning another outing with a big group of friends to take on their most difficult room, the Penitentiary. The extra couple of bucks that OMEscape charges over other companies is totally worth it, since their use of high tech props makes the experience so much more memorable, and really gets you into the setting. Thank you OMEscape for such a fun time. I can't wait to come back, and I hope you guys make some new rooms, so I can continue to return for some great new experiences."

I went with a group of roughly 20, and since our entire group had not arrived yet, they let us go upstairs first to wait--there were lots of board games that we could entertain ourselves with first. When our group was all here, we were split into 2 groups, one in prison break and the other in bio laboratory. I was in the latter. and the room was definitely challenging. There is a lot of observatory skills involved--it's easy to miss clues if you don't look through the whole room very careful. Overall, it was a very fun experience and I would definitely like to return to try the X-room!"

Among all the escape games we played, it is one of the tops. Worth the price. Great story line! You will get Into a series of rooms instead of only one. Difficulty is average (65/100) for experienced teams. Room design/theme is great. However the equipment needs more care maintained. Will definitely come back for other ones in OMEscapes!"

We were NYPD officers trying to catch the bad professor. The story is well-made up and the time is just enough, not too difficult but not easy!"
