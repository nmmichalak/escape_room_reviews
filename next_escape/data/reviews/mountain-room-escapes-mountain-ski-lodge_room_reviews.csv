I had done many other escape rooms in the LA area, but this was the first one for the other two people in our group. At the end, everyone was all smiles at the rush of puzzle solving and discovery. We plan on returning soon to do other rooms coming soon. Thanks again!"

The owner is an enthusiast and it definitely shows in the thoughtfulness and creativity of the puzzles. Joan was friendly and accommodating when we got stuck in traffic. No spoilers but there's a unique element of fun for the early finishers. Worth the beautiful drive!

Had a great time with my wife and three kids (age 15, 13, 10). The staff was attentive and friendly and the theme of the escape room was perfect for the being up in the mountains. We are glad that we escaped, and the kids said it was the highlight of our short summer getaway!"
"Escape room ""Mountain Ski Lodge"" by Mountain Room Escapes in Big Bear City",https://worldofescapes.com/big-bear-city/quests/mountain-room-escapes-mountain-ski-lodge,4,"We went as a group of eight with ages ranging from my 76 y.o in-laws to my wife and myself and our four kids ranging from 15 to 8. Everyone participated and had a great time. The theme was called ""Escape from the Ski Lodge"". It was very family friendly, no scary stuff at all. We've been to other escape places where it was a dark or supernatural theme and this one had none of that.The staff member, Sue, was very friendly and thorough, explaining everything to us and giving us clues if we wanted them. We escaped because everyone worked together and my kids absolutely loved it."
