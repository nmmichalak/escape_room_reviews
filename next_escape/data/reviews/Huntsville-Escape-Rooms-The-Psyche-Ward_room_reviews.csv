It was awesome and every little detail seems to matter. They will also provide hints through out the game if asked so that's a nice component. We did not escape so we're bound to go back and get a win!

We went with a group of 4 to the Psych Ward and got paired up with a family of 3. It felt a little awkward at first since we had never been and weren't expecting to be working with anyone else, but we quickly got past that and worked together to escape with 5 minutes left. Sooo much fun and I would recommend it to ANYONE who enjoys a good challenge. The staff was amazing, super friendly, and very helpful. I am already looking forward to the next opportunity to get a group together to go!"

We got Psych Ward, which they said has the lowest escape rate of all the rooms.We made it out with 1:43 left! I was really nervous, but it's the quickest hour of your life. Such a thrill! We had 6 people and it felt like the perfect amount. I hope we get to go back soon and do the other rooms!"
