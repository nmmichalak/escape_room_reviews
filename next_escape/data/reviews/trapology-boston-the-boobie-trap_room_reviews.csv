"Escape room ""The Boobie Trap"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-boobie-trap,0,Loved it. Amazing decor. Cool tech. A hilarious night out with girlfriends! We’ve played many games at Trapology before and the addition of an actor is a super fun one! 
"Escape room ""The Boobie Trap"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/trapology-boston-the-boobie-trap,1,This is an S&M themed room designed by someone that doesn’t do or know much about S&M. It was like a group of 10 year old boys designed it. Extremely linear room resulting in very frustrating pauses where puzzles were solved but no place to put the results. The story was so confusing it basically a heist.
