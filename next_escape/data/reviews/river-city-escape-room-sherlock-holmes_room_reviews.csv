"Escape room ""Manhattan"" by River City Escape Room in Richmond (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/richmond-v-a/quests/river-city-escape-room-sherlock-holmes,0,"The ""Sherlock Holmes and the case of Lord Byronâ€™s Murder"" room was incredibly detailed. The puzzles were challenging and complex. It was well worth the money for an afternoon outing with family!"

Only four people in our group had ever done an escape room so most of us didn't know what to expect. We all agreed it was the best! I highly recommend River City Escape Rooms for an time of challenge, thinking and laughter. The Sherlock Holmes room was beautifully outfitted to the time period which made the evening more special. We were warmly welcomed in by the friendly staff. That was an extra bonus for me since I was a bit nervous, never having done this before. All the way around - a great way to spend an hour with friends and family."

I have done the Sherlock room and today I did the Speakeasy. Thank you guys for such an amazing, immersive experience that allowed me to have a blast with family as well as people I've never met. Will be back to try to heist next!"
