"Escape room ""Tomb"" by 5 Wits in Albany",https://worldofescapes.com/albany/quests/5-wits-albany-tomb,0,The Tomb was my favorite! The staff really helped us get into character for the escape room. It was so fun that after the first escape room we insisted on doing all three rooms. I highly recommend spending an afternoon with your friends or family at 5 Wits!
