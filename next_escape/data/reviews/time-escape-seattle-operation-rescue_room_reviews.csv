"Escape room ""Operation Rescue"" by Time Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/time-escape-seattle-operation-rescue,0,This was super fun to do with a group! 45 minutes went by so fast. I loved that it was private and we wouldn't have been paired with another group like other puzzle rooms.

Staff was excellent, very well organized and accommodating. The puzzles were challenging, we definitely had to work as a team to escape in time. I've been to a number of escape rooms in Toronto, NYC, and Seattle, this one was definitely the best!"

The game is 45 min long - we tried Operation Rescue. We got out the last minute thanks to the helpful staff who helped us when we were clueless about what to do next. Looking forward to trying out the other games too!"
