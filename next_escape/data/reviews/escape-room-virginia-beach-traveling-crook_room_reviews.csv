Escaped from the Travelling Crook room with 13 minutes to spare, and one clue left completely unused (success rate is 14% right now). Staff was very friendly and appropriately informative. Will definitely come again!"
"Escape room ""Escape Room University"" by Escape Room Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/escape-room-virginia-beach-traveling-crook,5,Really fun and challenging experience. We had two adults and two children (12) and participated in the Traveling Crook room with another group of 4 adults. Everyone had opportunity to participate and each person solved at least one clue - having a larger group helps. This was our first time going and we definitely recommend this for anyone looking to do something a little different and have fun. Going to come back with a larger group from the office and see how it goes.

However, after we arrived and the game was explained we were really excited. My team and I quickly bonded and worked to solve the ""puzzle"". After about 15 minutes we were done. We discovered one of the locks did not work so we skipped a large part of the ""puzzle"". The 8 of us spent a lot of money and a 30 minute drive for 15 minutes of fun. They offered a small discount on our next visit. They owe us a free visit."
