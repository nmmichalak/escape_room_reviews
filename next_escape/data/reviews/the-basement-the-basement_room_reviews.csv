"Escape room ""The Basement"" by The Basement in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-basement-the-basement,0,"This was an awesome experience from the beginning. I don't want to spoil, so I will just say that the immersion in the game puts you in a scary place already. The decor was awesome, the clues and story line were very good too. Highly recommended if you like scary escape rooms. "
"Escape room ""The Basement"" by The Basement in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-basement-the-basement,1,"I have very mixed feelings about this room but I ultimately have to give it two stars because of the high price point per minute (this room is 45 min instead of 60) and the fact that the company over crowds the room by putting too many people in there. The first time we went with a group of 6 and did not get placed with anybody else for the first room in the story, The Basement. The story was scary and the story was well connected to the clues and everything flows well. The next day we returned with 6 people for the second room in the story, The Study, but this time we were placed with another group of 4, despite having paid around $270 altogether. The people placed with us had never done an escape room before and at parts were literally sitting on clues. Because of this we couldn’t get through most of the clues. When I called to talk about rescheduling, the company was very unhelpful and said the only was to book privately was to book the whole 10 slots, which would be very expensive, considering we had already spent over $500 at that company alone. This company also charges you to get the digital picture you take afterwards, which again, after spending so much money, seems silly. So, good storytelling and clues, but you often can’t enjoy them if you get out in an overcrowded room. "

We knew we had to try one during our vacation in Las Vegas. We ended up trying both The Basement and The Study. We both agreed that out of the many escape rooms and different companies we’ve tried, these escape rooms were unlike anything we have ever experienced. The live action, thrill, and scariness was insane! Great company and great people who work there. We would recommend to everyone!"

My group did both rooms, both are very very difficult total worth the trip. Definitely recommended if you are looking for something to do. Really great vibe, scary, good for anytime of year! If you are even remotely good at puzzles or have a group that needs something to do, this is for you."

As a 20+ experienced player, I can say that this was by far one of the best. The story, props, and immersion in the game all come together. Can't wait to do the other chapter!"
