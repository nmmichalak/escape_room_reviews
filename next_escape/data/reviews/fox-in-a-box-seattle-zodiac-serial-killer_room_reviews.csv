Soooo cool!!! I felt like a little detective!The staff was very friendly and I liked the lockers provided for personal belongings - something I haven’t seen in other rooms.Jo was our game supervisor and she took our experience to a whole new level.Can’t wait to go back for them to expand and add more rooms!

We chose the Zodiac theme room and it was challenging.  What made our experience extra special was meeting and working with both Ash and Austin the facilitators.  They were extremely friendly, gave us history of the theme we chose and clearly communicated the object.  We needed several clues throughout the game and both were there to give us key hints (not answers) to help us out. We will definitely go back."
