"Escape room ""Mystery of the Pharaoh"" by Wake Forest Escape Room in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/wake-forest-escape-room-mystery-of-the-pharoah,0,"We completed the mystery of pharaohs escape room. This was the first escape room that I’ve done that had you escape from more than one room. It was well designed, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and we were able to take pictures in the green room afterwards. Great price, and great fun! I will definitely be back to attempt the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Mystery of the Pharaoh"" by Wake Forest Escape Room in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/wake-forest-escape-room-mystery-of-the-pharoah,1,We came here for my sister-in law’s birthday! There were six of us and we did the Mystery of the Pharaoh! This was a first for all of us so we were not sure what to expect. We had an absolute blast! The puzzles were intriguing and took some thought but would be appropriate for most ages to figure out. There were lots of locks and puzzles and enough to keep everyone engaged. We finished with 17 minutes to spare and are still talking about it hours later! The staff is very friendly and did a great job explaining how puzzle rooms work. We are already planning our next trip to do the Exit Protocol room or one of the new rooms they are building! Would highly recommend for a fantastic group outing!

There were only 4 adults and my 9 year old nephew. It was our first time trying one of the escape rooms. It’s a fun time! Thank goodness for my nephew he was great at finding clues!
