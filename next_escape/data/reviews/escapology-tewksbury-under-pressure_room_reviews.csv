Very high quality experience with tons of detail to dig into. We did the 'Under Pressure' room with my wife and two college-age kids and all had a great time! The rooms and lobby are super clean, well managed and the staff was helpful and super friendly. We'll be back soon!"
"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Tewksbury in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escapology-tewksbury-under-pressure,2,"This was out first attempt at an escape room. We were very impressed with the professional staff and general appearance of the facility. Our room (Under Pressure) was extremely well themed with excellent production value. The scenario was immersive and you really could feel the ""pressure"" to succeed as the time ticked away. The puzzles were all challenging, but fair. I would definitely recommend Escapology Tewksbury and hope I can return again to try another room soon."
