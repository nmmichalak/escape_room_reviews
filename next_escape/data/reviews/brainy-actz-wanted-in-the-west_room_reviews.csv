"Escape room ""Wanted in the West"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-wanted-in-the-west,0,"Being a working mom usually means hoping to survive the day. When I called brainy actz the day before to schedule a surprise visit for my husband, Kevin made my reservation so smooth and accommodating. From start to finish, our first family escape room adventure was a blast. The challenges were fun and really tested our smarts. Our kids ages 9 & 7 were so involved and excited to find some of the clues. Nathan was our host and made us feel confident on taking on this endeavor. We didn't beat the clock but we made it out of the western escape room. We can't wait to try the rest of their rooms!!!"
"Escape room ""Wanted in the West"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-wanted-in-the-west,1,Really good time here. We did the Western room and it was a blast. Four of us (my 2 teenage sons and my dad joined) managed to make it out. Maaaaaay have needed an extra couple of minutes minutes but what are you gonna do. Tabatha was really helpful and friendly. I think we'll be coming back!
"Escape room ""Wanted in the West"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/brainy-actz-wanted-in-the-west,2,First time doing an escape room and we were not disappointed!!! Came for girls night out and we had so much fun!!! The room was awesome and the girl at the front desk was super sweet (I believe she was pretty new so definitely a good hire). We will be going back for the other rooms for sure!!!
