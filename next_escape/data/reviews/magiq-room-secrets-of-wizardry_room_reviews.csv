"Escape room ""The Secrets of Wizardry"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-secrets-of-wizardry,0,"It is great to see a company with all kid-friendly rooms. The game master recommended to start off with this one and then progress to the other rooms. I took my nephew and it is his favorite so far. Secrets of Wizardry had the perfect amount of spookiness that is appropriate for children. The puzzles were perfect for my nephew to figure out on his own. He barely needed my help, I was crying happy tears that day. I can't wait to take him to the other 2 rooms offered here."
"Escape room ""The Secrets of Wizardry"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-secrets-of-wizardry,1,"Ton of fun! My friends and I reserved a spot and checked out ""Secrets of Wizardry"".  It is technically a ""rookie"" level, but admittedly, I thought it was pretty hard...or at least very tricky.  This was my second experience ever doing an escape room. I went with my girlfriend and four other friends and we had to find our magic wands (we being wizards and all, cursed by an elf...perhaps a Hungarian elf) and find out how to escape the room in one hour. Nicely decorated with clever puzzles, you can ask for hints using a walkie talkie if you are really stuck. It is a type of experience you talk about long after it is over. Quite fun! Side note: street parking is recommended as there are just a few parking spots in the back. "

You get 60 minutes to solve a bunch of puzzles and find the item you are looking for to get out. I played the pirate & wizard rooms here. The rooms are beautifully decorated to their unique themes. The puzzles are not too difficult, so children would enjoy them too. They are still challenging enough for adults, especially first time puzzle room players!"
