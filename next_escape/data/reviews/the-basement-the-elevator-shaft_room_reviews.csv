I did it with one other person and it was perfect.  Clues were very well done and room effects were amazing.  Something that stands out above all other escape room places is the amazing staff, everyone is so nice!! Our hostess was Jazz and she is awesome, so friendly and really helped us get into the mindset for the room! Can't wait til they expand (hopefully!) or change some more rooms so I can keep coming!!"
"Escape room ""Chapter 2: The Elevator Shaft"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-elevator-shaft,1,The elevator shaft was dope. I can't stop thinking about it. 5/5 for sure. You feel like the elevator shaft is going to fall on you if you don't solve the puzzle. Nicest most realistic escape room i've been in. High-quality design!
