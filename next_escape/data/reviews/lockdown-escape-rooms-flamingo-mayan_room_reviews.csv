It was stressful but the puzzles were so fun. My friends and I had a great time. Although we asked for clues quite often, the clues were nice and helpful. The staff, Bryan and Jordan, was really nice and helpful, considering my friends and I were yelling very loudly the whole duration"

I am very tired of doing the same old thing. We always either go to the movies, bowling or golf. This was such a breath of fresh air and our group laughed the whole time. I like how they take photos of everyone at the end so that you can remember the experience. The staff was so nice and they made sure you enjoyed your time. I can't wait to come back and try the other two themes! "
