"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-runaway-train,0,"Breakout Games in Falls Church was absolutely amazing. My date and I did the ""Runaway Train"" game with our game master being James. The game was so much fun, and honestly, I recommended a lot of people to go to Breakout Games to experience the same game we tried. James was an amazing game master and truly helped us when we needed it. He gave us hints that were still mysterious, so it left you confused but they were helpful nonetheless. The hints made the game more exciting and throughout the entire time, I never lost that excitement factor that the game provided. Shout out to James for being an amazing game master/host. Give James a promotion or something because he killed it. Thank You for the great experience, and to anyone who is unsure if you should go or not, DEFINITELY GO! I had such an amazing time, I cannot explain it in words. I will definitely be coming back again."
