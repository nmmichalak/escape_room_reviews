"Escape room ""Operation: Santa's List"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-operation-santas-list,0,Solid escape room.  The themes were thoughtful and relatively well done.  I did two here.  The seasonal Christmas theme was good for the kids but you can tell was not as well integrated into the puzzles.  I find the best escape rooms integrate the puzzles into the story or logic of the escape in such a way that one does not feel like one is doing a puzzle just for the puzzles sake or just to get to the next puzzle.  It really does feel like you are solving a mystery and are performing some deductions and detective work.  The Santa Operations felt like one puzzle after another.  Still the kids had fun.  I have done one of the other staple Escape Rooms and felt like it was well done.  Definitely worth doing with friends or the family.  This is a well run escape room company and serves the customers well.  The staff was friendly.

It exceeded our expectations. We wanted to do one that wouldn't be too scary but were a little worried it would be simple..it wasn't! Really fun, super tricky, great family fun. The staff were really friendly and professional and it was clean and well organized. We all left wanting to come back. Thanks guys!"
