"Escape room ""Abandoned School Room"" by Houston Panic Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/houston-panic-room-abandoned-school-room,0,Fantastic experience! It was the first time any of us had done an escape room. There were 10 of us doing the Abandoned School Room and it was a lot of fun. It was more challenging than I expected but we did escape with 2 mins to spare. I would highly recommend this as a group activity with friends or colleagues. I will definitely try the other rooms!

The clues were pretty hard but we worked as a team. Hopefully, we will make it next time. We were left with two locks left."

It was hard but fun and most of all it taught us all that teamwork makes the dream work which in this case was to escape the abandoned school room. I recommend everyone give it a try. #teamlastminute
