"Escape room ""Civil War"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-civil-war,0,"I did the Breakout KC Civil War room in Lawrence which I assume is similar. It was so immersive, down to having to do it by lantern light. I want to do that one again even though I have done it once because it was so fun. We did not breakout, we were working on the last puzzle."
"Escape room ""Civil War"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-civil-war,1,Been to both locations and both of them are super sweet! The crew is always so nice and friendly; they really make the experience fantastic. My favorite room so far (out of 4) is the Civil War room at the park place location in Leawood. Give it a go sometime!

I have done both the Y2K room and the Civil War room and had a blast in both. I was lucky enough to get the same employee both times and Joanie made it so fun the entire time.
