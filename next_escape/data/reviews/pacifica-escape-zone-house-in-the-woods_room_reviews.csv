"Escape room ""House in the Woods"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-house-in-the-woods,0,"I'm a first timer and my friends had experienced another escape room before.  We did the House in the Woods and found it very challenging.  There were only 3 of us and did not make it, but I was impressed with the detail of the puzzles.  Recommend it for an hour of angst and realization of one's incompetence...kidding...it was fun!"
"Escape room ""House in the Woods"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-house-in-the-woods,1,"We visited Pacific Escape back in April. It was a long drive for us to Pacifica, CA but it was a nice & scenic one near the coastline. There’s plenty of parking outside of Pacifica Escape Zone. When you pull into the complex, you might not be able to see the name Pacifica Escape Zone as it’s named as their parent company “Anime Imports”.In addition to Pacifica Escape Zone, the owner also owns a comic book store in the near vicinity so if you are a comic book fan, make sure you check it out! As we entered the lobby area, there’s really no check in or décor which we thought this could be improved to give the player the whole experience. Today, we are trying their newest room called “House in the Woods”. They currently offer two rooms total with ""Murder Scene"" being the first. In ""House in the Woods"", you are playing in the dark for the majority of the time which makes it quite challenging. If you like escape rooms with locks, this is the one for you! Since there is a lot to do in this room for just two people, we were 95% in and didn't escape in time. Pacifica Escape Zone is trying to acquire another space within same complex to create another room! We can't wait to see what they have planned for their future!"
