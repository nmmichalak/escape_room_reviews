"Escape room ""Space Station Escape (VR)"" by Riddles Escape Room in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/riddles-escape-room-space-station-escape,2,We did the Escape the Space Station VR room. The owner was very friendly and explained everything very well. He put us all at ease with what we would be experiencing. Very funny and friendly guy. The VR experience was awesome. Figuring out how to escape was challenging but not impossible. It was fun to see how everyone in our group acted and what roles they played. We almost escaped..but just missed it! It was a hilarious but fun time however. Loved it. Dying to try another of their escape rooms. I highly recommend.
