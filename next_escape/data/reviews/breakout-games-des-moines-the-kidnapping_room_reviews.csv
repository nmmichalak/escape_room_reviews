"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-the-kidnapping,0,Kidnapping is my second favorite room at Breakout. Did it with one other friend and we finished with 12 minutes left. So much fun and loved the environment for the room. The puzzles were a great difficulty for the 2 of us. Not too hard and not too easy. We had a great time.
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-the-kidnapping,1,We did the kidnapping and it was awesome! It was just the two of us since no others had signed up for that time slot so that was nice. We ended up needing more than the allotted 60 minutes but since there was no one else signed up after us they let us finish! They only give hints when you ask which is also awesome. The only drawback we experienced is the safes in the room were malfunctioning and would lock us out after every wrong entry rather than after every third wrong entry like it's supposed to. I highly recommend and we will be returning!
