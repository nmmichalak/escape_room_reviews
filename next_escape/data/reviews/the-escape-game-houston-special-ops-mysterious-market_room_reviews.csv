If you're on the fence, do it! Great for groups. Javar was fantastic! This would be a perfect place to have a birthday party or just some get together. The puzzles get somewhat challenging so bring your smart friends to help"

We've been to escape rooms all over the country and this is by far one of the best. Super detailed rooms with tons of fun puzzles, unexpected surprises and openings. Plus a great staff! We were celebrating a birthday and they gave us a card that everyone signed with sweet little noted and gave to us with a free escape room birthday shirt. Will be coming back for sure."
