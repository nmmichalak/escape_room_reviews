"Escape room ""A Clinical Trial"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-a-clinical-trial,0,"My wife and I tackled the ""Clinical Trial"" room and had a great time. The owners are onsite and put a lot of time and effort into making this a great attraction. It was our first escape room experience and we will definitely be back to attempt the other room and anymore to come. "
"Escape room ""A Clinical Trial"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-a-clinical-trial,1,"My husband and I did this as a date activity for just the two of us. We had so much fun, we would do this again and again. We did the clinical trial room and it was challenging but not too difficult to take the fun out of it. The owners were super helpful and friendly and it was clear that they put a lot of work and creativity into making this a great experience for everyone. This was such a great way to spend time together and definitely worth the price. "
"Escape room ""A Clinical Trial"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-a-clinical-trial,2,"My wife and I narrowly escaped the Clinical Trial room. It was amazing. So much fun. The puzzle was linear, but not simple. The puzzles were varied and the clues were well thought out. You can tell that a LOT of effort goes into making the rooms and puzzles. We will definitely do this again next time we are in Hot Springs. "
"Escape room ""A Clinical Trial"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-a-clinical-trial,3,"My husband, 12 year old son and I did the room ""A Clinical Trial"" and had a blast! The clues were challenging, but each of us was able to play on our strengths. We got stumped once or twice, and they gave hints when needed. Other escape rooms I've been to gave a limited number of hints and/or penalized for hints, but A Narrow Escape does not. We solved the puzzle with less than 2 minutes to spare. We will definitely go back when we are in town again to try one of the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""A Clinical Trial"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape-a-clinical-trial,4,"I took my husband here as a surprise because he loves a good brain game, and we were not disappointed. Based on the description, I chose to go with ""A Clinical Trial"" for the simple fact that we weren't a large goup (although the two of us might have been okay doing any of the rooms). After we succeeded in escaping, we immediately wanted to do another!!"
