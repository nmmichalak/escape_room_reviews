"Escape room ""The Torture Chamber"" by Exit Strategy in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/exit-strategy-the-torture-chamber,0,"Just did ""Torture Chamber"" at Exit Strategy Games and it was awesome! One of the hardest rooms I have attempted. I highly recommend giving it a shot."
"Escape room ""The Torture Chamber"" by Exit Strategy in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/exit-strategy-the-torture-chamber,1,"First time here, second time overall doing an escape room and my experience here was amazing! I like how you can have just your own group whereas other places they combine groups. We did the Torture Chamber and you definitely have to communicate! The clues were difficult but not overwhelmingly so. Michael was super friendly and we did ask for help a few times and he would give us hints just enough for us to figure it out without just giving us the answer. It was a lot of fun and definitely would go back/recommend this place!"

It was tons of fun and spooky. Michael was our game host and he was so awesome! He was super nice, funny and helped us when we got stuck. I do recommend playing with at least 4 people... two people just isn't enough to get through all the puzzles. I'll definitely be returning!"

We had a group of 11 people and did the Torture Chamber and escaped with 4 and a half minutes! It was so much fun. We will definitely be back to do it again."

It was our first escape room and we can't wait to come back to try the conspiracy room! The guy at the front was enthusiastic, and did a great job getting us in the problem solving mindset. Can't wait to come back this summer!!!"

It was just the three of us and it took us a lot of time (we didn't make it) so I would recommend doing in a group of at least 4-5. The room was well done, required lots of communication, the puzzles were difficult but not extremely so, and I especially enjoyed the intro video :) Michael was genuinely good-natured and it was great interacting with him before and after the game."
