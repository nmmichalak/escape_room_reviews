"Escape room ""Wizard's Keep"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-wizards-keep,0,"Been here three times. A couple friends and I have done most of the rooms here and we always have a blast doing it, even when we get frustrated and lose the game, we still have fun overall. The rooms are really well thought out with awesome props and themes that by-far exceed any other escape rooms the Fresno/Clovis area has to offer. Wizards Keep was my personal favorite. It used very imaginative puzzles that had us doing some silly things to try and solve them. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't take themselves too seriously and is willing to have some fun, I know I can't wait til we go back."
