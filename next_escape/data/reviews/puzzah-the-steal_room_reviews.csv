"Escape room ""The Steal"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-the-steal,0,"Even though my wife and I died in the end, we had an absolute blast!! This was the most fun, as well as the most frustrating and rewarding experience I have had since living here in Denver. This is an awesome idea for spicing up a date night. The staff is amazing and extremely friendly! I definitely recommend Puzzah for anyone looking for something fun and different!! #puzzah #datenight #tictoc #brainhurtsnow"

"Escape room ""The Steal"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-the-steal,2,Such a great time! We had 5 people and it was a blast. You have to push your thinking in different ways and trust me...you will be challenged in ways you can't guess. Some innovative creators have come up with a unique experience. Strongly suggest everyone gives it a try! Can't wait to go back again for a different room.
