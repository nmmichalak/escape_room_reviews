"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-do-not-disturb,0,"This was super fun! It was the 2nd time doing an Escape Room for most of us! This room is very small, so I would say no more than 6 people should be in this one! It was a little dark and hard to see things. They did provide a flash light, but 2 would have been nice for our group! We had to ask for a few clues because there were a few things that were pretty difficult and the guy that worked there told us this was one of the more difficult rooms in the place! We had a Groupon, so the price was cheaper! It is in the Ridgedale Mall on the first level, right by JC Penney! We would go back there again to try another room!"
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-do-not-disturb,1,"I've done both Hostage and Do Not Disturb rooms - both were very fun and very different. Only concern is the size of the rooms seems pretty small to be comfortable for 6-7 people, 4-5 feels more accurate."
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-do-not-disturb,2,Went for my friends 17th birthday and it was so fun! The workers are really polite but kinda awkward and gave us clues without us asking. Iâ€™ve been here three times and the first two we did were museum heist and hostage. They were amazing.
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-do-not-disturb,3,I have done about a dozen different escape rooms and I can honestly say Breakout is my favorite. The rooms are so well planned out and have the best mix of task difficulty per room. I would say about a third of the tasks are fairly easy and the other two thirds moderate or difficult. I believe this is important because the percentage of easy tasks makes you feel like you're making progress instead of spending a lot of time on a difficult task just to unlock another difficult task that may stump you.The staff is very helpful. I just completed the new Do not Disturb room. Breakout has raised the bar with this new room and has created an escape room unlike any other.
