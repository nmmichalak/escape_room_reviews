"Escape room ""The Great Diamond Heist"" by Rockville Escape Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/rockville-escape-rooms-the-great-diamond-heist,0,"Decent room and we had fun doing it. Aesthetics were just okay. There was a countdown clock in the room. Part of the room feels designed for younger players, but many of the puzzles are more appropriate for adults. Best not to overthink it. There is better than average variety of puzzles, especially for an intermediate room."

Against better judgement after one bad experience with the rude and unhelpful staff, decided to go back because the kids enjoyed the challenge and again, had a terrible experience with staff.  Our group of 5 students was not acknowledged when we arrived and were ignored and left to sit and watch as another group arrived 10 minutes after us but were greeted and escorted to their challenge.  We did not begin our challenge until 26 minutes after our start time.  While the room and challenge was fun for the students, feel that we can get the same experience just down the road at the Game of Rooms Escape Room.  Do not give your money to a business that treats its customers so poorly"
"Escape room ""The Great Diamond Heist"" by Rockville Escape Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/rockville-escape-rooms-the-great-diamond-heist,2,"We did the Diamond Heist. I thought it was fun, but kind of low budget. Some of the clues were very obvious and some of them were not at all. There was also way too much math. We literally had 2 scientists in our group and even then we had to ask for a couple of hints. It's not that it was overly difficult, but some of the clues were not clear at all. I'd probably go back, but honestly I'm not going to solve all that math crap by myself so I would only do it in a group."

Can't imagine having more than 5 people in that room. Way too much math and one part was not clear AT ALL.

Did two rooms with my family - the zombie and then the diamond heist. First time for all of us. The Zombie Escape was hard but best by far. The Diamond Heist felt like it was missing steps needed to solve the puzzles. Had a blast, can't wait to try more."
