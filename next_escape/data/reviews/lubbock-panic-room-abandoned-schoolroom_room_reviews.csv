Two of us already did Escape the Room before and the rest of us were complete beginners. The puzzles were filled with chemistry, math problems, lockers, etc. The manager was helpful with her hints. I had fun eating the candy we found all over the room. In the end, we had a blast and made it out with only 10 seconds left!"
