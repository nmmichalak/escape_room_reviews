"Escape room ""Pirate's Curse"" by Escape Room Zone in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-room-zone-canton-pirates-curse,0,"Iâ€™ve visited several escape rooms and this one was one of the most unique and best experiences I ever had! Our guide was friendly, the effects and holograms were so entertaining , and very clever yet challenging puzzles. We even fired off a cannon! Took my wife on our anniversary and had a blast!"

"Escape room ""Pirate's Curse"" by Escape Room Zone in Canton",https://worldofescapes.com/canton/quests/escape-room-zone-canton-pirates-curse,2,I enjoyed doing the pirate theme escape room. The scenery was done very well and the clues/props were great. Some were easy and some were difficult but everything flowed together. The only thing was we didn't know if we had won or not at the end and just walked out. We escaped with 5 mins left!
