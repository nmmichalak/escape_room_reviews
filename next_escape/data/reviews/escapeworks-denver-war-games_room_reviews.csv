"Escape room ""War Games"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-war-games,0,"Fantastic escape room. War Games was very challenging, but they gave us help when we needed it. Great staff. Great design. Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting Denver. (We were a 6 person bachelor party and chose this as one of our activities)"

War Games and the updated Egyptian Tomb room were fantastic and we look forward to coming back to complete the others.
