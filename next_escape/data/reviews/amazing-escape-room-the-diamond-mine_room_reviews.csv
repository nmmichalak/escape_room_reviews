It couldn't have gone any better!! The woman who greeted us and got us signed in was super friendly and gave us some insight on what we could expect. The other woman who gave us our clues was absolutely amazing also and only helped when we actually needed it. This was such an amazing experience and we will definitely be doing it again!! I suggest for everyone to at least try this!!
