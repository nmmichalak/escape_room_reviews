"Escape room ""Club LOL"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-club-lol,0,We went to Legends in March for my husband's birthday and had a blast. We reserved an entire room (LOL CLUB) since we had 8 people in our group. It was almost everyone's first time doing an escape room. We had so much fun and did escape with about 20 seconds to spare. Highly recommend it!

We had two adults, two teens and two 'tweens. We did Club LOL. Booking online was easy. The person who explained the room and rules did so very well. The room was rated a three and we did manage to escape. We didn't use clues, although we were tempted during the last 15 minutes - but we made it. This was our second escape room experience, but our first at Legends. We will be coming back."
