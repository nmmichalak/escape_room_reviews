"Escape room ""CSI: SLC"" by The Escape Key in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/csi-ut,0,"Super fun!! Definitely recommend! We did the CSI room and it definitely made you have to think. I would probably keep your group no larger than 7 people, the room wasn't that big and it was difficult to move around without being on top of each other."
"Escape room ""CSI: SLC"" by The Escape Key in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/csi-ut,1,The Escape Key was super accommodating to our large group and the staff was easy to work with while setting this up in advance. My group did the CSI room. It was fun and complicated enough to keep us engaged. I've been to multiple escape rooms in the valley and The Escape Key has been my favorite. Reasonably priced. Would recommend.

What fun, we did it with just our family of four, great fun and laughter. Kids should be probably 9 and up..otherwise they don't know what's going on."
"Escape room ""CSI: SLC"" by The Escape Key in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/csi-ut,3,"Best date I have had in a long time! Skip dinner and a movie and come here! 60 minutes to solve a series of clues to escape the room. Very well done and challenging. Sherlock Holmes feel to it. They take groups up to 10. We had 9 and only knew the 4 we came with. Had a blast still. Definitely come with a bigger group, more minds to solve the puzzles. The owners were super nice too. Clean place in downtown SLC close to Washington Square. Can't wait for more rooms to open and solve the puzzles there."

The room was challenging but not frustrating or impossible. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful, we are already planning on going back!"
