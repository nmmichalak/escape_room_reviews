"Escape room ""The Vault"" by Symbology Escape Rooms in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paradox-escape-rooms-the-vault,0,"We had a group of 6 people escape The Vault - it was amazing! I would say that the space is a bit tight with 6 people, but it still worked. The room is a challenge, but not impossible. This was our first time escaping a room, and this seemed like a great room to start with. We were able to get out, but with only 30 seconds to spare.Staff was friendly and helpful. The facility was well maintained, clean, and everything was in working order. Highly recommend!"

We had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. They had simple solutions and were yet tricky to solve. Overall, it was an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend it!"
