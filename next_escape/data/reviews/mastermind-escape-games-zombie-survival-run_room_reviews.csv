I have always wanted to do this, so I made them participate. We chose the Zombie Run. We all had a blast! My nephew can't wait to go back! I think I got him hooked! They did an awesome job with the game and helped us with a few clues, but we still ended up as zombie chow! Next time we visit we will do a different room! I look forward to returning!"
