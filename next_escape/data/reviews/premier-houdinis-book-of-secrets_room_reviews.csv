"Escape room ""Houdini's Book of Secrets"" by Premier Escape Adventures in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/premier-houdinis-book-of-secrets,0,"My wife and I tried the Date Night Disaster and the Houdini, Book of Secrets escape rooms. They were both very detailed, challenging and fun! We also tried the virtual reality, which was awesome. If you've never experienced high end virtual reality, you have to try it! The owners are great, very friendly and want you to have a fun experience. We will definitely be back when the additional two escape rooms open. Thank you for a great time! :)"

Very challenging yet fun, it makes you really think outside the box. I highly recommend coming here to try the games. So far Houdini was my favorite."

The puzzles were challenging but totally solvable. The staff was very friendly and the facility was nice and fresh. We did the Houdini themed room and it was well themed.
