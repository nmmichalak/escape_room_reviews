"Escape room ""Elliot Ness Investigation"" by Perplexity Games in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/elliot-ness-investigation-perplexity-games,0,"Came here with a group of friends last week and had a blast! We've been to a few other escape rooms before and this one was really unique as it showcases some of Cleveland's history, i.e. Eliot Ness, which the owner enthusiastically explains at the start of the challenge. Loved the flow and logic of the puzzles, really look forward to coming back when the next challenge is ready!"

The Elliot Ness room is very well put together. The puzzles and clues throughout the game were the perfect balance; brain-twisters that keep you thinking, but are possible to figure out if you work as a team! We will be back for the next room that opens up for sure."

The experience was completely immersive and I felt as if I was actually transported back to the 1930's. All of the clues/puzzle were well thought out, clever, and stuck with theme of 1930's cleaning up Cleveland corruption and illegal gambling. Awesome experience, had a great time."

With some excellent customer service during the reservation process (thanks Diana), a few well-timed hints, some pure dumb luck, and a mad dash at the end, we managed to make it out with 3 seconds to spare! Now I'm addicted, and I can't wait to try the other escape room!"
"Escape room ""Elliot Ness Investigation"" by Perplexity Games in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/elliot-ness-investigation-perplexity-games,4,Really cool! We chose the Elliot Ness room. We were SO close! Not knowing what to expect as no one in our group of 4 had done an escape room. Kate was wonderful in explaining the process. My sons are hooked we will definitely be back.
