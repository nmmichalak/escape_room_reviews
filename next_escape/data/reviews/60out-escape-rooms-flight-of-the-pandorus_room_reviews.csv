"Escape room ""Galaxy Quest"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-flight-of-the-pandorus,0,"We've done a lot of 60out rooms and let me tell you, this place is something SPECIAL. Galaxy Quest: more challenging than Krampus. LOVED Cosmo, who gave me as much sass as I gave him. And the little friendly alien, who distracted us for longer than we probably should have been- but he was just so cute! If you like more tech-heavy effects do this one. I recommend at least 3 people if you're just casual escape room fans."

My 10 year old daughter and I enjoyed the high immersion, the sense of humor, and the sci-fi nature of the room. The puzzles were quirky and fun. I found myself repeating some of the directions because they were useful. It was also important to listen to directions given. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and found we had a lot to do and were fully engaged in either saving the world or destroying it. We did have a couple of tech issues, which honestly, happens in escape rooms in Los Angeles. I've come to expect them, but they didn't take away the joy we had in playing this room. (The only place where we've played escape rooms that have a lot of high tech and did not have any tech issues was in Israel, but the puzzles were not that interesting in the rooms we've played there.) We both enjoyed the puzzles at Galaxy Quest because of the mix and uniqueness.I would highly recommend this room to families of tweens, couples who want to laugh and work together and get to know each other better, and groups of friends looking for a fun, challenging time.There is a parking lot in the back and clean restrooms. The GM and owner, Brian was stellar."

I've been to the Marina Del Rey location a few times and was very impressed. This was my first time at this location, and it did not disappoint either.First off parking is very easy. There's a huge free attached parking lot. They have a few different rooms of varying difficulty. We chose the Galaxy Quest room which is by far the hardest room I've ever done. It is very different from many of the other rooms that I've done. 60out is great, and I can't wait to do some of their other rooms."
