"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Garwood in Garwood",https://worldofescapes.com/garwood/quests/escapology-garwood-the-code,0,"If you haven’t tried this venue, you are missing out!This is one of the best experiences, by far, that we’ve had. The rooms are set up according to the theme and are in great shape. It’s immersive and the clues are according to theme. We have done 2 of their rooms so far... Th3 Cod3 and Cuban Crisis, and both were phenomenal compared to almost all of the other games we’ve done. We actually booked to do another room in the next couple weeks even tho we live 45 minutes away. It’s worth it.The game masters were respectful to not give you clues unless you asked for them. The staff was courteous and friendly, which is an important part of the experience, I think.The venue itself is classy, and seems like the perfect place to hold a party or corporate gathering...We can’t say enough positive things about this place."
"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Garwood in Garwood",https://worldofescapes.com/garwood/quests/escapology-garwood-the-code,1,"I'm pretty active on the local escape room circuit and this place blew my mind. I fully recommend starting with Th3 C0D3; the puzzles were varied and imaginative and incorporated the perfect amount of technology to immerse you in the setting without feeling gimmicky. Escapology struck a perfect balance between puzzles that can be worked on simultaneously and independently, and puzzles that require team work. My boyfriend and I love when we can each ""do our own thing"" at times to set-up the solves, but when the game naturally guides us to reconvene to work on the more collaborative puzzles together.The staff was so fun and helpful, we already booked our next room and can't wait!"

We picked ""Th3 Cod3"" room. We absolutely loved the room! Tons of fun, great staff, management rocks! If anyone is looking for something fun to do, I would recommend this place in a heart beat! I liked this place so much, that I am coming back on the 15th. ""Budapest"" room here I come!"
