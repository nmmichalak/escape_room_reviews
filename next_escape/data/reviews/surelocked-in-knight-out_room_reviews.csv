"Escape room ""Knight Out"" by Surelocked In in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/surelocked-in-knight-out,0,"One of the better rooms we've ever done. Lots of fun. The staff really gets into it, and you can tell that they love what do. They're having as much fun as us. This room is challenging. There are a lot of puzzles, most of which can be done in parallel. The puzzles can be difficult, but nothing the feels ""out of right field"". The room doesn't have a lot of room for failure, we had to be super efficient and nearly perfect to make it out."
"Escape room ""Knight Out"" by Surelocked In in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/surelocked-in-knight-out,1,Played both the pirate and knight games. Had a great time. Staff was so friendly and the riddles were so creative. Will be coming back to play the witch hunt game when it comes out. Can't wait!
"Escape room ""Knight Out"" by Surelocked In in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/surelocked-in-knight-out,2,"Finally got a chance to get up to Frederick to try out Surelocked Escape! Six of us did Knight Out and had a blast. We are also escape room owners, so we look at things with a pretty critical eye, and Surelocked delivered! Fun theme, creative puzzles and great staff. Perfect fun night out with family and friends."
