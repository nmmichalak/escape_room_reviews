"Escape room ""Dead Man's Secret"" by Conundrum Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/conundrum-escape-rooms-dead-mans-secret,0,"We had a fantastic experience solving the Dead man’s secret! It was a real conundrum with no shortage of clues and puzzles. John and Sabrina were great, they genuinely want everyone to have the best time possible attempting to escape. I highly recommend giving this a try, you won’t be disappointed!"
"Escape room ""Dead Man's Secret"" by Conundrum Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/conundrum-escape-rooms-dead-mans-secret,1,"Definitely a good time, although I'm not sure why we decided to do the hardest room for our debut escape. Guess that's what happens when you hang out with a bunch of over-achieving brainiacs. We had an excellent time and would highly recommend Conundrum for your escape room escapades. Everyone was super friendly and informative. Not ever doing an escape room before I wasn't sure what to expect. The helpful people at Conundrum explained everything and we were on our way to finding our way to unlocking the mystery of Deadman's Secret. Conundrum has 4 escape rooms, each with a different theme and difficultly level. The pricing is great and they can accommodate large groups with a bit of notice. Don't be surprised if you don't escape the first time.Pro tip: If you get stuck, don't wait too long to ask for a clue!"
"Escape room ""Dead Man's Secret"" by Conundrum Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/conundrum-escape-rooms-dead-mans-secret,2,"We are escape enthusiasts, and to date have played 126 rooms globally. This place is legit! We have played both CABIN IN THE WOODS and DEAD MAN'S SECRET and both productions, tech, puzzles, and flow were amazing. Their price point is fair at $25 per player and I like that they have an option to book a private room for $150. They are normally closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but I called and they were able to fit us in fortunately. Had a blast! I think having four players is the right number of players for the difficulty level but can possibly be done with just two players but will be tough to do in 60 minutes. As a comparison, we have also played at Denver Escape room and they are great, but this place is awesome. These two companies are the top in the area"
