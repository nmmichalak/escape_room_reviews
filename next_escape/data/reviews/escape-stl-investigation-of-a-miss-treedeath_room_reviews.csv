"Escape room ""Investigation of a Miss Treedeath "" by Escape STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-stl-investigation-of-a-miss-treedeath,2,"My wife and I went alone. This was our first escape room and based on our experience we will definitely do more in the future! I'm not sure how the other locations are in the area but the worker was very nice and helpful. We didn't reserve the room either and he went through the trouble of setting up the room and answering all of our questions to get us in. I'm not sure of his name but he might recognize this, so thank you for being so great!"
