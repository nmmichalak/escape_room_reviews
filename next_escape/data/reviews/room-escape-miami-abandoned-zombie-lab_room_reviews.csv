"Escape room ""Abandoned Zombie Lab"" by Room Escape Miami by Fox in a Box in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/room-escape-miami-abandoned-zombie-lab,0,"Terrible venue. They start the clock exactly on the hour and end the room exactly on the hour. Get caught in a Florida thunderstorm while driving an hour to visit the venue? Too bad, you lose 10 minutes. The hour is up and you're literally 5 minutes from finishing the room? Too bad, you need to stop playing immediately even if they don't have another group scheduled after you. After 25+ escape rooms I've been to I've never seen such disgusting customer service."

My friends and I had a really good time. This place uses technology to make the overall experience very creative and interactive. We did the Abandoned Zombie Lab, and it was such a fun experience. I would definitely do another room at this location."

This was definitely a fun time we had to analyze, search and use quick thinking to beat the 1 hour clock. We won with 3 mins to spear and only needed to ask Jo for 1 clue. Our team consisted of myself (The mom), my two sons who are 18 and 21 years old and my sister."

Hard to choose a favorite between the zombie and prison. The decorations support the story, and the zombie lab also has creepy music that keeps you on your toes! The puzzles are challenging, but not impossible, and the staff are always ready to help out with a clue when you've hit a tough spot. Overall a great experience, and I will be back when the new rooms open!"
