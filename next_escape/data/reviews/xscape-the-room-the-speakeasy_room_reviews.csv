What a great afternoon spent with family! Xscape the Room (Speakeasy) was just a fun, challenging and engaging experience regardless of the age. Had a great time! Gong back when the kids all come back for Thanksgiving! Can't wait!"

We were lucky enough to escape the Speakeasy (and Bugsy's wrath). The room was very well put together, and it was challenging, but not to the point where you were so overwhelmed that you wanted to give up.We can't wait to do it again next year!"
