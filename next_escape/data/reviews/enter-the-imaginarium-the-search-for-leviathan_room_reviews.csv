"Escape room ""The Search for Leviathan"" by Enter the Imaginarium in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/enter-the-imaginarium-the-search-for-leviathan,0,"The escape experiences (don't want to classify these as escape rooms as they are so much more) are incredibly detailed and keep you engaged from start to finish. We did Chamber of Illusion once but did not escape, It took two tries on Inventor's Paradox to make it out with 3:47 seconds to spare... and last Sunday we took on the Search for Leviathan and it was amazing.... We did not make it out but enjoyed the creativity of the new experience... This place puts all other escape rooms in their place. Well done to the ""Inventors""!!!!"
