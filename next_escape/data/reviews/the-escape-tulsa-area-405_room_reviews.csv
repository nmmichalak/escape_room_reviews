"Escape room ""Area 405"" by The Escape Tulsa in Tulsa",https://worldofescapes.com/tulsa/quests/the-escape-tulsa-area-405,1,"I LOVE the Escape Tulsa. This place is what I compare all other escape rooms I've been at to. The rooms are immersive, challenging, and the location is awesome. The staff are awesome and I wish someone would wipe my memory just so I could do their rooms again. Area 405 is my favorite for sure. Perfect place to bring your family and friends if you're looking to kill an hour (or less) of time."
