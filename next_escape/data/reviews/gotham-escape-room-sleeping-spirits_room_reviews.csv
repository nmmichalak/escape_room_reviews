"Escape room ""Sleeping Spirits"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-sleeping-spirits,0,"I only did a 5 minute minute escape room before, so this is my second time doing an escape game, but this one was definitely a lot more complex, and it was amazing! I was surprised we won, and it was definitely creepy, I LOVED IT! 10/10 would recommend, and am in fact doing it again tomorrow, so if that doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will!!!"
"Escape room ""Sleeping Spirits"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-sleeping-spirits,1,This was a really great escape room- the quality was noticeably better than others I've been to. It was challenging and rewarding. Only critique is the mic system makes it kinda annoying/hard to hear the hints/prompts. I bet they've fixed it by now- the guys are all obviously very hard working and dedicated to making a nice experience for customers
"Escape room ""Sleeping Spirits"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-sleeping-spirits,2,Great game master! Exciting and challenging room.
"Escape room ""Sleeping Spirits"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-sleeping-spirits,3,"These rooms were AMAZING. We did all three - Chamber of Horrors, Game of Stones, and Sleeping Spirits - and loved each more than the last. Chamber of Horrors was first, and was wonderfully gory and suspenseful, a must for horror movie lovers. Next up was Game of Stones, which was so much fun - we loved the theme and all of the clues and props. Last up was Sleeping Spirits, which was a super fun, creepy room (we went home and watched 1408, the story it's based on). These were some of the best, most theatrical rooms we've done, and we've done a lot (50+!) A must-do if you love rooms!"
