"Escape room ""Locked Up Supermax"" by Mind Trap Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mind-trap-escape-rooms-locked-up-supermax,0,We did two escape rooms here and they were so much fun. The rooms were designed so intricately which really made for a fun experience. The puzzles were also very challenging. The people working there were so nice. They were excited when we got out of the rooms and even offered us a bottle of water in between rooms. We plan on going back for the Collector room and laser tag!

Nicely complex room with group and solo puzzles, multiple rooms and automata. Everything was nicely themed as well. Sitting at lunch afterwards we're talking about going back to do another new room there!"

No we didn't make it. We needed at least another hour lol! But there was just the 2 of us in the Supermax Prison break one. I'm floored by the creative ways they hid clues!!! It was fun and something different and I can't wait to do their other rooms. The people who worked there were younger adults or teenagers and they were all respectful, fun, helpful and kind!"
