"Escape room ""Doomsday"" by Escape 101 in Danbury",https://worldofescapes.com/danbury/quests/escape-101-doomsday,0,Best experience ever! We did the Doomsday room tonight and it was definitely worth the money and very well organized. Our team worked so well together and escaped with just a second left! We will definitely tell everyone we know to try it out at least once. Best birthday ever thanks to Escape 101.

Everyone there made us feel welcome and guided us nicely through the experience. The two different rooms we did (Jet Set and Doomsday) were very different from each other in theme, types of puzzles offered, and difficulty. It's really an exciting experience for all ages and a wonderful opportunity to do something out of the ordinary with friends. I would highly recommend going here, whether you're a beginner or an experienced player. You'll have an exhilarating time!"

The staff couldn't be nicer! The room was full of detail and the clues were not easy, which provided a very entertaining hour. We will definitely be back for more rooms."
