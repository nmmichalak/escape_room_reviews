"Escape room ""Western Bank Heist"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/western-bank-az,0,"The bank heist room was nice because it involved more props and physical activity than just writing down numbers and opening locks. The decorations were also great. Way too small for 12 people though, and a bit hot inside the room."
"Escape room ""Western Bank Heist"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/western-bank-az,1,"Meets the excellent standard of a great escape room. We did the Western Bank Heist with a group of 8. Apparently their hardest room! We had a good flow going, but for anyone you needs it you can get hints - of course their eyes and ears are on you the entire hour. Really cool system - one of the mirrors actually doubled as a TV for typed hints. With a little boost on the most embarrassing ones to miss, we were able to get out with less than five minutes to spare!"

It was a blast!!! We all had so much fun that we can't wait to book another adventure here. I highly recommend it for something fun and different to do.
