"Escape room ""Oval Office"" by Exithis in Mansfield",https://worldofescapes.com/mansfield/quests/exithis-oval-office,0,"This place was WONDERFUL! We drove 2 hours to get there and honestly, I'm ready to drive back and do it again tomorrow. We did the Oval Office and had a blast! Some of it was tricky but we made it out with 30 seconds to spare! The owner was a super nice guy and incredibly talented at putting this stuff together. Thanks for a great time!"

Tonight we tried our luck at The Oval Office and although we failed, it was so much fun! Challenging and creative clues! Brad is awesome and always takes the time to explain the rooms. Thanks so much for a great time!"
