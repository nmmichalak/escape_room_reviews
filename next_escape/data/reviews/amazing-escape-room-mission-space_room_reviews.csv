"Escape room ""Mission: Space"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-mission-space,0,We went last night and had so much fun! Second escape room for me and this one was far better. The puzzles and clues are very elaborate and well thought out. I don't want to give anything away but I want to go back and try other rooms they have.

Been here 3 times and each time I've experienced a different challenge full of interesting surprises. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun night out while still staying local!
