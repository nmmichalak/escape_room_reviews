"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/the-great-escape-room-providence-professor-moriartys-gameroom,0,I went to The Great Escape Room today with my family of 5 and was paired with another group of 5 for the Game Room. We all had an excellent experience solving a series of puzzles and eventually escaped! The Game Room was very well put together and fun for everyone.

We did the Gameroom, and Amanda was our game master. She was fantastic, and we had so much fun because of her! We got paired with three other women and had a great time working together with them. I'm from PA but if I ever come back, I definitely want to do one of the other rooms with Amanda!"
