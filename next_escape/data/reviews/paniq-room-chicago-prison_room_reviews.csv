Good price for the five of us and easy booking. Upon arrival, the level of customer service was amazing. Heidi our game maker was full of energy, friendly, set up the scene perfectly, and left us wanting to come back for more! We went through the Prison room and it definitely had its challenging moments but worth every second."
