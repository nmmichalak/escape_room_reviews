"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/EscapeMKE-James-Bomb,0,"Michele, the bride, was the common factor in bringing her friends to meet her some of her new in-laws!! What a fun group! We did the James Bomb experience and got out of handcuffs, discovered some poor soul's remains and diffused a bomb before we all blew up in the basement of a bank with SEVEN minutes to spare!! There is a pre-lock-in briefing, the one-hour experience and a debriefing (keep your pants on) too! Don't wear heels or your fancy clothes because you will be moving about. Lot of puzzles to solve, keys to find and communication to do! It got a little warm in the room with 8 women talking but that was it's only drawback. If fact, we were so good at thinking outside the box that one of our ideas maybe included in future adventures. Hope to be able to do another experience with my co-workers!!"
"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/EscapeMKE-James-Bomb,1,"Very fun and has a lot of potential to be amazing. There's so many directions that they could take this concept, which makes me excited to see what they come up with in the future. I would definitely do this again and recommend this to anyone.Sadly, the hour goes by so fast. As soon as your group exits the room everyone just wants to do it again because it's so fun.My only complaint is that there's no sign on or near the building that says ""Escape MKE"", so when you arrive you're not sure if its the right place. A sign is highly recommended."

We had an amazing time! It was a great way for our staff to work together to figure out the clues. There were also 3 strangers with us & it made the experience even better.Thanks for the amazing experience! The staff were great!!!
"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/EscapeMKE-James-Bomb,4,"We were in town for the weekend and my husband found out about this place online. We were with our daughters, ages 12 and 15. We were put with another group since it was just the four of us. Wasn't sure about it, but they were great! We were worried we wouldn't get our money's worth, but was worth every penny! So much to do and clues to find, I was glad we had ten of us. There was so much to do everyone was able to participate. We were also afraid that our 12 year old would be left out and unable to contribute, but she participated as much as the rest of us. Will definitely be back to try another one. Thanks Lauren, or ""Tammy from Yankee Candle!"""
"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/EscapeMKE-James-Bomb,5,This was an absolutely great experience. The missions are challenging but not so much that you don't have fun. Our group finished with less than a second left on the clock but we made it. I would definitely do this again and I highly recommend anyone interested in puzzles give it a try.

Had an absolute blast from the moment we walked in there. It was challenging, but with the help of the rest of our teammates we did a great job trying to get out of there! I would absolutely recommend Escape MKE to all of my friends and family, no matter the occasion!"
