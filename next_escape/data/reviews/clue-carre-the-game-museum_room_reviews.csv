"Escape room ""The Game Museum"" by Clue Carré in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/clue-carre-the-game-museum,1,The game room was a heart pumper. Took 6 of us all they way down to the last 33 seconds to get out. I can't wait to try another room. Rhy was an excellent game master.

The Game Room gives you a serious rush. So many games packed into one room. Rhy was amazing this was the second time we worked with her. Amazed that she actually recognized us. We can't wait to try the other room in maybe 2 months.

"Escape room ""The Game Museum"" by Clue Carré in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/clue-carre-the-game-museum,4,"We just did the Game Museum at the Metairie location and we loved it! We are from Missouri, visiting for Mardi Gras, and we have now done 20 rooms including this one. This one has some unique and fun aspects we had not experienced in others before, when we come back to Louisiana we definitely try the other rooms. Rhy was our GM, she was awesome and very helpful when we needed her."
