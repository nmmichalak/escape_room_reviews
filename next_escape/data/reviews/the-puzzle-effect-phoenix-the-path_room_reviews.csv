"Escape room ""The Path"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-the-path,0,"One of the more memorable escape rooms I have done, the design was excellent, both in the room and the puzzles themselves. It was great change of pace to do a room that didn't use any conventional lock puzzles."

"Escape room ""The Path"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-the-path,3,"I just finished their two new rooms, The Path and Curse on the Emerald Sea, at their new location and I must say that they were both quite well done and very indicative of the care they put into the business. Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."
