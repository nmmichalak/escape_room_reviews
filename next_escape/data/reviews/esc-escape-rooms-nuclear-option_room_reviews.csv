"Escape room ""Nuclear Option"" by ESC Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/esc-escape-rooms-nuclear-option,1,"So... We did Esc Escape Rooms ""Nuclear Option"" last night and it was amazing. I haven't seen much discussion about this one in my Facebook escape room groups, but it's in a double wide shipping container in North Hollywood behind a tiny community theater. Room was super fun, creative, and the owner Rick was a hoot. Highly recommended. This one deserves more way attention from the community. I've done more than 100 rooms worldwide, and this is one of the more memorable ones. Superbly well executed and staged. Check it out!"
