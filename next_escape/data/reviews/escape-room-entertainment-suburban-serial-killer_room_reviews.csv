They put a lot of thought into the storyline and puzzles for their rooms which makes it exciting and enjoyable! I’ve done the “Suburban Serial Killer” and “Wanted”, I can’t wait to try the other rooms."
"Escape room ""Suburban Serial Killer"" by The Escape Company in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-room-entertainment-suburban-serial-killer,1,Our group did Suburban Serial Killer and loved it! It was all of our first time doing a room escape game and we got out with just a few minutes to spare. Curtis was very nice and helpful. It was lots of fun.

Everyone at the facility is very kind and the room itself has a lot of different puzzles so you really feel engaged in what's going on no matter the size of the group (I was in a group of 7). My group and I loved the Silent Tide room and because of Matt, we'll definitely be back to try more of the rooms!"

We did the Serial Killer and had a blast! Staff was super helpful and the owner was wonderful! The room was well done in both decoration for the theme and the puzzles in the room! We will definitely return with the family!!
