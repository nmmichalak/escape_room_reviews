"Escape room ""Prohibition"" by Escape Blue Ridge in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-blue-ridge-prohibition,0,"The Prohibition room here was my first escape room ever, but I've done more since. The staff's very friendly, and we got to meet their adorable dog Bailey. Unfortunately, we could not take Bailey into the escape room. Presumably, because he knew all the answers already. ;) But this was truly a great first escape room experience. The friend I was with had done other escape rooms, and he found this just as challenging and enjoyable, so I'd say good for newbies and vets alike. Definitely want to try their other escape room next time I'm in Blue Ridge!"

The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was fun and challenging. Meeting Bailey the pup was a bonus! Thanks for a fun family adventure."

As far as escape rooms go this is very well planned and challenging. I would highly recommend visiting this establishment while in town. It's a great addition to a great community. The owners are very sweet and entertaining!We definitely will return next visit to Blue Ridge!
