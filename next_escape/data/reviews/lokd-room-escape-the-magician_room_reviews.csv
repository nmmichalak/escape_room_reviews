"Escape room ""The Magician"" by LOK'd Room Escape in Manchester",https://worldofescapes.com/manchester/quests/lokd-room-escape-the-magician,1,"My wife of nearly 50 years and I enjoyed ""The Magician's Room"" together and, as it happened, we were the only couple that evening. This was nice in that the staff allowed us extra time to work our way out. The staff was friendly, helpful and encouraging and the many challenges made it exciting. We definitely will try another room, perhaps with another couple whom we know."
"Escape room ""The Magician"" by LOK'd Room Escape in Manchester",https://worldofescapes.com/manchester/quests/lokd-room-escape-the-magician,2,We did the Magician's room 6 of us and we found it challenging well thought out. The staff was amazing. We did it with 2 mins to spare. I highly recommend this and we look forward to trying another. Thanks so much. Great night!

The Magician was my favorite, followed by The Lost Soul. The Vault was not as impressive, but was a good challenge nonetheless. As someone who has done close to forty escape rooms, I would highly recommend this place!"

Had so much fun! Challenging puzzles and great props/decor. Staff was super friendly! Shout out to Loakim for being an awesome game master! :) Can't wait to come back and try the vault!
