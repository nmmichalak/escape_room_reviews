"Escape room ""The Mad Scientist"" by Escape Dalton in Dalton",https://worldofescapes.com/dalton/quests/escape-dalton-the-mad-scientist,0,"After playing over 20 escape rooms, I would definitely rate this room in my top 5 favorites. We played Mad Scientist and will definitely be back for Carpet and as they open more rooms! It was on par with the better Chattanooga escape rooms and very well thought out and put together. The puzzles were challenging and the design was wonderful. You've got to check this place out!"
