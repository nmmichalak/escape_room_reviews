Our group completed Collision with about 5 minutes remaining. It was challenging and themed very well with some new tricks we haven't seen at other escape attractions. Check it out when you get the chance! They also have a great bundle that includes some perks...
"Escape room ""Collision"" by One Way Out Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/one-way-out-jacksonville-collision,1,Wow what a great business! We did the Collision room and it was tough but it was fun. The challenge makes the escape room worth it. The owner came to talk to us afterwards and told us about the story behind the other rooms.

We were in the ""Collision"" room. We have visited several escape rooms around town and this was by far the most fun and challenging room we have tried. They are clearly proud of their art and spent time talking to us after we finished to get feedback and make sure we had fun. We will definitely come back to try the rest of their rooms."
