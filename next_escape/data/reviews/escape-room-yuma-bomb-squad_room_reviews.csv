"Escape room ""Bomb Squad"" by Escape Room Yuma in Yuma",https://worldofescapes.com/yuma/quests/escape-room-yuma-bomb-squad,1,10/10 I had some family from out of town come down to Yuma for the weekend and we decided to try out the escape room we did “the bomb squad” and it was a very fun/tricky hour... we had a blast and are already planning our next one when my family is back in town! If you haven’t went yet... oh boy are you missing out! To top off our wonderful experience the staff was very friendly and helpful!
"Escape room ""Bomb Squad"" by Escape Room Yuma in Yuma",https://worldofescapes.com/yuma/quests/escape-room-yuma-bomb-squad,2,We tried the bomb squad room with a large group. We were all having a blast with the room master. Candace was awesome! The room isn't overly difficult but it does make your brain work quite a bit. We had teenagers and adults so our crowd was mixed. If you are looking for something to do we recommend that you check this place it. It's something that you normally wouldn't do but you'll enjoy it!
