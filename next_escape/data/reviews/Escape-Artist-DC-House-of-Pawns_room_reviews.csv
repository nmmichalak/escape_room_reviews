"Escape room ""House of Pawns"" by Escape Artist DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/Escape-Artist-DC-House-of-Pawns,0,"Sadly we failed to escape the room - but we were close. Went as a group of 7 (4 adults, 3 kids) - none had ever done an escape room before. We were greeted promptly -- and everyone was so super nice and friendly. Had a great time trying to figure out the clues - very well put together - not simple, but not impossible. I would suggest this to anyone that was to try something else."

"Escape room ""House of Pawns"" by Escape Artist DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/Escape-Artist-DC-House-of-Pawns,2,A 3 generation birthday party for 10 of us. What a blast. We solved it as a family but that was only part of it thrill. Watching grandparent and teenage grandchildren all working alongside was awesome. Highly recommend and then walk around the corner to 8th street for a great meal afterwards.

In both instances, my group was the only one in the room, which was nice. This is a great team-building, critical thinking, and fun experience - even if we didn't make it out in time from one of the rooms. The owners will be changing the rooms/clues every few months which will allow people to go back for repeat visits to try a new challenge. It's nice to have an option for something different to do on an afternoon or evening out. The location is great as Barrack's Row restaurants/bars are just around the corner. Highly recommend this for families, friends, coworkers, etc."
