"Escape room ""The Prison Escape"" by Mainely Escapes in Waterville",https://worldofescapes.com/waterville/quests/mainely-escapes-the-prison-escape,1,Last minute decision to try something new as a family and we had a BLAST! Thanks to the teenager (who now wants to go work there) we made it out with time to spare! We'd probably still be in jail if it wasn't for him! We can't wait to try School of Hard Locks!
