"Escape room ""Cell Block"" by Escape Space Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escape-space-games-tualatin-cell-block,0,"This has been one of the most fun experiences I have ever had!!! I've never been to an escape room before and this blew away my expectations. My party of 3 did the ""cell block"" room and our host was incredible. He was enthusiastic, fun and very organized. I also really the set of the 7 rooms!! They were gorgeous! The puzzles were difficult and had us constantly scratching our head. Overall, extremely fun and amazing place to go with friends, family or by yourself!!! Great price too!!"

Yes, we escaped Cell Block (with just a few minutes left) but also the room was fun, creative and not overly crowded with stuff to confuse us or slow us down. Not gonna lie, we were a family of 7 so yes, our dynamic helped. But moreover it we just enjoyed the creativity and fun. I recommend!"

Ages 9,14, 17.  The first room we did was the Tualatin valley room.  We only made it half way but had a lot of fun.  This time we did the Cell block.  We almost completed it and it was way more fun.  All in all I think this is a great place to take a family and or a date.  We purposely chose rooms that were designed for 3 or more people but I'm sure the smaller rooms are just as fun.  Like I said earlier we still haven't completed any rooms but this is a lot of fun either way."
