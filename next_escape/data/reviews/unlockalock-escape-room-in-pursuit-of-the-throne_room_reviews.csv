"Escape room ""In Pursuit of the Throne"" by UnlockaLock Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/unlockalock-escape-room-in-pursuit-of-the-throne,0,Absolutely loved this escape room! My best friend and I have done quite a few so we were really excited to see how this one was set up. The owners were incredibly friendly and accommodating which made the experience positive from the start. We did the Medieval room which was decorated very well and had challenging puzzles! I highly recommend this escape room and will definitely be going back to do the other room!

We had a lot of fun even though we didn't feel very smart. The 60 minutes goes by SO fast. The owners are friendly. Can't wait to go back.

Our group did the King/Throne room and it was excellent. Atmosphere was great and the owners took the time to make you feel welcomed. Will definitely be back!
