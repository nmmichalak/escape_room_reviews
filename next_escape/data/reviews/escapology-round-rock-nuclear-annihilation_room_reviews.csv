"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/escapology-round-rock-nuclear-annihilation,0,"The experience is in the details. What makes this escape experience outstanding is the multiple types of puzzles, challenges and environments. This time I went with my 15-year-old daughter and her friend but next time we will bring the whole family. We saved the world from Nuclear Annihilation. Will you?"
