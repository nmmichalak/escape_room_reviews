"Escape room ""Tahoe '64"" by Key and Code Escape Rooms in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/key-and-code-escape-rooms-tahoe-64,0,"We've successfully escaped from the Tahoe '64 Room and the Chain Reaction Room. We enjoyed the Tahoe Room better because of the creative unique props and puzzles and the use of local lore. We've played over 20 rooms, and we rank the Tahoe Room near the top. Chain Reaction was also fun, but more stressful, with a buttload of puzzles and lots of red herring props. Hope to return to try their other rooms. Highly recommend."
