"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-special-ops,0,"My daughter and husband wanted to play a game, and I had never played before but was so impressed with everyone from the front desk to our game guide Nathaniel. He was so personable and made us feel great when we escaped (with a little help, ha!). Thank you all for the wonderful time!"
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-special-ops,1,"From the front desk, booking with Nathaniel, was a breeze and very informative of what to expect. We chose Spec Ops, even though there were only two of us, because we wanted a challenge. Boy did we get one. Val was an awesome guide and we had an absolute blast. We played before heading into the Braves game..let’s just say the only winners that day were the Braves because we did not get out in time. Close..but missed it by one clue set. Regardless, it was an amazing time and my girlfriend and I absolutely loved every second of it. Great bonding and awesome time together. Josh, Val, and Nathaniel knocked it out of the park..so did Freeman and Swanson that day, too! Definitely a must do in the Battery."
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-special-ops,2,I played Special ops and playground and they were the best games I’ve ever done! Really immersive and really felt like I was there! And I got out of both! Definitely go check them out!
"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-special-ops,3,"To Zach, Josh, Courtney, and Brianna, thank you from both Dylan and me!! This staff will bend over backwards to make sure you enjoy your time in their rooms! It is absolutely clear that this group of employees is close knit and well managed. Each personality shines in it's own way, adding to the fun of each visit! These are some of the best rooms available. We've played escape games in at least five major cities and after having played 'Heist, Gold Rush, and Spec Ops' these are some of the best!! The sheer ingenuity of each room is astounding! We were challenged in ways we'd never before seen in a room. If you're seriously considering taking up the escape room challenge, do yourself and a favor and book here! It may be just a bit more expensive than other places, but it is ABSOLUTELY worth it.Again, thank you to Zach, Josh, Courtney, and Brianna for making our experience fantastic! Trust and believe we'll be back with reinforcements to take on Prison Break!"

The staff was great, attentive, and super friendly. We did 2 rooms, prison break and special ops. The prison break room was the most difficult(we didn't escape) and special ops was pretty difficult as well( we escaped!) Overall it was a great experience and I hope to be returning soon!"
