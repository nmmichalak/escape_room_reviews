"Escape room ""The Alleyway Vigilantes"" by Breakout's Imagine Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/imagine-escape-games-the-alleyway,0,"This escape room is incredible! We have played the alleyway and jungle gem. Thee puzzles are very creative, i like that it's not just a bunch of locks/boxes. We went with a group of three for both rooms and were able to escape each of them. We are very excited to try research and any other rooms that they open up!"

We played “Alleyway Vigilantes” which is Part 1 of their story (that all of their rooms tie into). This was Room 53 for me and it was simply phenomenal and clever both mentally and physically. Our GameMaster was awesome and put up with our bad superhero jokes. If you are in the area and looking for a really fun time, this is the place to go."

Very fun, challenging and interactive! Did Alleyway Vigilantes and it was the right balance of brainwork and activity. The kids had a blast! I want to go back with grownups!"

"Escape room ""The Alleyway Vigilantes"" by Breakout's Imagine Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/imagine-escape-games-the-alleyway,4,AMAZING! This room is absolutely one of the best we've played. We have about 40 or so under our belts and the eye of detail and even the surprise factor to their rooms is fantastic. We had such a great time with Jungle Gem of theirs that we just had to do the Alleyway! Fantastic job guys!!!We will definitely be back to do the rest of them when they open.
