"Escape room ""Art Heist"" by Escape Room Delaware in Dover",https://worldofescapes.com/dover/quests/escape-room-delaware-art-heist,0,I did the Art Heist yesterday with two other friends and I really enjoyed it. This was our first escape room. After explaining what it's all about I was interested. We got out with a little help from the guide. Bring a bigger group for a better chance to escape. It was very fun overall.
