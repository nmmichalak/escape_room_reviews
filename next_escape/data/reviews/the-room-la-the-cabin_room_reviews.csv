"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by The Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-room-la-the-cabin,0,"On yelp this room was listed as easy and not challenging. However, ever since they hired a new game master & revamped the room. it is definitely a more difficult room from before. My wife & I have done 29 room & this  Cabin was great. we did not get out in time & the clues were helpful & followed the story. I believe this room is now a 3-4 key  compared to other room with the same rating. WE Loved the room & great puzzles. we will be back for spaceship!!!"

The puzzles in The Cabin were definitely challenging. Our group had somewhat limited escape room experience overall, but we did escape, with just over 11 minutes left! Looking forward to returning when the Spaceship room opens!"
