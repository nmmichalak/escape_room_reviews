"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,1,"This room was a ton of fun, and Devon and Savannah made it a wonderful experience.  There were 12 of us, and they joked around and had fun with us.  There were enough puzzles for everyone to be working-highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,2,"My large family of 12 loved escaping from the outbreak room! It was difficult enough to keep is entertained yet we wer able to escape before the time was up. Devon and savannah were very entertaining and funny, we hope you get them as your escape room guides, they gave us extra laughs and fun! Definitely recommend this room!"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,3,"This is one of the best rooms I've done in Denver, and my family has sampled at least one from all of the major players. I liked that it was a little more difficult, I also liked some of the less-common puzzles.  We had a group of ten, and there was plenty to keep each of us busy. Definitely not a room for newbies to cut their teeth on, unless they're with some seasoned players. We will return to this outfit to try some of the other rooms. A+"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,4,"I agree with the other reviews - this room is extremely difficult.  However, my group did escape.  A lot of the info was there - you just have to find it... it wasn't obvious like a lot of other rooms.  There was a lot going on in the room (probably need many players - our group of 10 was never bored).  It was a great experience.  Will be back."
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,5,Not the worst escape room I've ever done but the room I did was near impossible to complete and there was more random guessing involved instead of a logical storyline progression through the puzzles.
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,6,"This room is considered to be one of the most challenging escape rooms in the city. With that said, it still seemed a little too hard even after they've explained how the puzzles should have been solved. Make sure you understand where you're going before you book, definitely do not recommend this for newbies. Otherwise, still had fun and will be back again."
