"Escape room ""Special Ops"" by The Escape Game Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/the-escape-game-minneapolis-special-ops,4,"This had a number of unique puzzles to solve, but too many ""nudges"" from the game master were necessary to point out how we needed to progress after solving a puzzle.  Also, many of puzzles cannot be solved simultaneously, so I suggest not playing the room at capacity... part of the group will get bored since space won't allow you to all be working on the same thing.Played with a mixed-party group of 7: 1 child, 6 adults, 3 of whom were complete novices. Difficulty rating of 3 seems correct. Solved."
