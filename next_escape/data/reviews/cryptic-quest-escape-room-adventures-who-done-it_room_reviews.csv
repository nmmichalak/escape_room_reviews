"Escape room ""Who Done It?"" by Cryptic Quest Escape Room Adventures in Fayetteville",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville/quests/cryptic-quest-escape-room-adventures-who-done-it,1,"We went with a party of 4 and did the ""Who Done It"" room. It was a blast. We escaped with 5 mins to spare, with a little help from the owners. It was not overly complicated, but the puzzle sure did make you think. We will back to try out the air plane room and the time warp room soon."
