"Escape room ""Malice Manor"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escapism-portland-malice-manor,0,This is so far the best date night ever.  The escape room is so amazingly put together and has such a great story/atmosphere. 
"Escape room ""Malice Manor"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escapism-portland-malice-manor,1,We had such a great time in the Malice Manor room! It was thrilling and interactive too! They had some really cool gadgets to tinker with and the effort that went into putting the room together was amazing! Even though we didn't escape in time we still enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait to go back!

Escapism puts clever thought into each clue and so much effort put forth to keep with the theme of each room. It’s not just a bunch of puzzles and locks, there is so much to it! I’ve done escape rooms with larger companies in other cities and nothing compares to Escapism. My favorite so far has been Malice Manor, but I’ve completely enjoyed Dr. Zyclov (a great first escape room), Alien Zoo, Magician’s Menagerie, and The Ritual Room (another favorite)."

We had such an amazing time!  The puzzles were solvable but tricky, and the whole event was well throughout and a little scary. It was our first time ever doing an escape room and now we are hooked and can't wait to do more. I would highly recommend choosing Escapism if you are looking for a escape room well worht the $$."
