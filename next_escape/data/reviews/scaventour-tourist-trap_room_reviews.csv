"Escape room ""Tourist Trap"" by Scaventour in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/scaventour-tourist-trap,0,"This was overall a fun experience, but not really for hard-core or experienced escape room players. My wife and I played just the two of us. The puzzles were too simple, not at the complex puzzles in a well-designed escape room. This would be a great activity for families with kids maybe 6-14 years old."
"Escape room ""Tourist Trap"" by Scaventour in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/scaventour-tourist-trap,1,Great concept and what an awesome way to see Hawaii and learn about some of their history.
"Escape room ""Tourist Trap"" by Scaventour in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/scaventour-tourist-trap,2,"I was lucky enough to test out Scaventour's Tourist Trap. The game was such a creative concept, forcing me to think outside the box with the puzzles and discover new sites around Waikiki that I had never noticed before. The course had us walking roughly around 1 1/2 miles, but we were having so much fun with the various puzzles and Waikiki scenery that we hardly noticed the distance we were traveling! This is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience that takes the concept of escape rooms to a whole new level. Definitely excited to see more to come from this company, and can't wait to share this experience with family and friends!"
