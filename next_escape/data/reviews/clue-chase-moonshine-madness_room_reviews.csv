"Escape room ""Moonshine Madness"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-moonshine-madness,0,It was a great time. Facility and staff were great! Lots of fun we will be back. Went for a birthday party and puzzles were challenging but doable.
"Escape room ""Moonshine Madness"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-moonshine-madness,1,"This was my first escape room, though others in my group had done them before. We had 8 people in our group and this one definitely requires 6-8 people to keep track of things in different areas! Just the right level of difficulty though a few extra clues did help. We got out with 15 min to spare! I would totally recommend this! üëçOnly downside... they took our group picture at the end and the text link they sent had our names, our stats... BUT the photo was of a different group! That was super disappointing! We‚Äôve tried emailing and contacting them via text but no reply. üò¢"
"Escape room ""Moonshine Madness"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-moonshine-madness,2,"We went to clue chase with the whole family. We had to split in to two rooms. Moonshine and Houdini. Brian was an angel sent from heaven. He was so kind and fun. He steered us in the right direction without giving away answers. ""Dr. Cool"" is not ok. He was so rude and mean. One half of the family had a wonderful time as Brian directed. The other half is UPSET AND MAD because Dr. Cool was NOT NICE. he kept coming in to yell at us. Give us two items and asks why we would do what we did eith them (no spoilers) SO CONDESCENDINGLY. Go to Clue Chade but ask for BRIAN."
