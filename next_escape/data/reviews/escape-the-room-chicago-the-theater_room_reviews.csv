"Escape room ""The Theater"" by Escape the Room Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-the-room-chicago-the-theater,0,This has been the best escape room I've done so far! I love the level of difficulty of the room that we did and I love how much team work it took. Ive done other rooms but this one really require us to put our head together. The staff was also super frienly and helpful. The clues where clear enough but not so clear to where it wasnt fun. Definitely check it out.
