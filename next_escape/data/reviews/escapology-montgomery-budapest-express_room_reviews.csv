"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/escapology-montgomery-budapest-express,0,"Such a fun experience! The decor was beautiful in the lobby area and featured really cool pieces of art from a local artist. The Budapest Express was difficult, but very interesting. I went with a group of friends and we had a blast solving the murder mystery together. I want to try all the rooms!"
