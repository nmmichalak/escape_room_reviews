The staff was very accommodating and understanding. They had a great attitude. The rooms were creative and different. We did the villain/superhero room and they said it was their easiest room, but it was still challenging and thought provoking. We had Sloan during for our session and she was helpful, attitude, and overall made our experience a fun one. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
