It kept the interest of all of us which was 4 generations! We did the ""Bootleggers' Den"" and definitely plan to do another escape. Our host was, well, a great host. I think he was almost as excited as we were when we escaped with 10 min to spare!  The puzzles definitely made us think and work together.  Great activity to do with out of town company. "
