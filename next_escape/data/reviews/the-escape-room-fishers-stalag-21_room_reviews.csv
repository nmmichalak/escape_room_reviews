"Escape room ""Stalag 21 (American POW)"" by The Escape Room Fishers in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-escape-room-fishers-stalag-21,0,"We did the POW Room with just three of us and we absolutely loved it. The room was very well done. The props and setting were fantastic and so was the story line. Jake, our Game Master, was awesome and truly made this business stand out to us. We have done many Escape Rooms and I think that POW is probably in my top three Rooms. Thanks for designing great things. We hope to come back for another room soon!"
