Our group was of six people, and it was our very first go at a breakout game. It couldn't have been more fun!! The fabulous set-up - the scene, clues, and even some very surprising ""special effects"" make it an engrossing and fast-paced experience, and the clever puzzles keep you engaged the whole time. The staff is extremely friendly, and you can tell that they have just as much fun setting things up as we do playing it. We are definitely hooked and will most certainly go back for more!! Thanks Breakout Atlanta for an exciting evening!!!"
