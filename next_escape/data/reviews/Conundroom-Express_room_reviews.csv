"Escape room ""Express. Stop the Train!"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/Conundroom-Express,0,We did the Mona Lisa Heist on 2/2/16 at 6 pm and stole the Mona Lisa in 55 minutes! Six of us went and had a really awesome time. Everyone always had something to work on and the puzzles were varied and interesting. Two of us had done the Express room last fall and enjoyed that one as well. Looking forward to the next one!

We weren't able to solve it but got close. I felt like the puzzles were a nice challenge, we were on the right track for solving the puzzle but ran out of time. Our family already wants to go back to do the train room."
"Escape room ""Express. Stop the Train!"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/Conundroom-Express,2,we had a larger group of 8 which is allowed but I think smaller groups would make it a little easier to know what's happening. I felt that in some cases I wasn't sure what the goal was and that was slightly frustrating but again with so many people doing so many different things in a large group it could have partially been that. Overall we all very much enjoyed it and I definitely plan on trying other rooms in the future! The price did seem a little high but no higher then other rooms I've seen. Fun experience and I definitely recommend to others wanting to try something different for a night out!

Went with four friends, and we all had a great time discovering new clues, and piecing them together. We only just made it through! Definitely not easy (at least, not for us mortals. I'm sure Sherlock would be in and out no problem, but like I said, we mortals will find it much more entertaining). Seriously though! Felt like a Nancy Drew moment come to life! (Was gonna say Agatha Christy, but there weren't any grizzly murders, so thumbs up there)"
