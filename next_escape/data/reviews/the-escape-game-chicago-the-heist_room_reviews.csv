Signed up on a whim passing by after dinner, showed up 3 hours later and escaped from ""The Heist"" with 8 minutes to spare!! Not too bad for our first time with 6 strangers we will never see again. The entire experience was a treat, so much fun. An incredible rush!! Highly recommend!!"

Wow! Half of our group did the Heist and the other half did the Mars Mission. Everyone enjoyed using their wits, creativity, (and a few hints) to solve the puzzles and escape before time elapsed. The staff was great, the location excellent, and I will go again!"

Challenging but keeps you excited and entertained the entire time. Great for large groups or even two like my husband and I did! If you have the time and are in Chicago, a must! We will be back to try them all!"
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-the-heist,4,We went here with our 11-year-old daughter yesterday while exploring the city and could not have had more fun. The level of detail that it's put into each room and game is utterly astounding. I was skeptical whether it would be suitable for someone her age but she absolutely loved it. The employees were incredibly welcoming and kind and calmed our nerves. We will definitely be back!!
