"Escape room ""The Deadwood Saloon"" by Masterpiece Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/masterpiece-escapes-the-deadwood-saloon,0,"We came and did the Deadwood Saloon last night and holy cow was it a ton of fun! The puzzles were very creative and difficult and we barely completed the challenge in time. It was an absolute blast. The atmosphere was excellent and it was very clear that the employees were very passionate about escape rooms. Everyone is super nice and helpful, please come and check this place out. So much fun for your friends and family!"

I've been to 4 or 5 other escape room places, but this is easily my favorite so far. The staff were super friendly and helpful, the room looked really cool and I could tell they put thought into every little detail, and also - a refreshing change from other places - it was a nice mix of different kinds of puzzles and clues (never too much emphasis on one type), the perfect balance of mental challenges and more tangible interactive-type elements. I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!"
