"Escape room ""Dr. Watson’s Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/the-great-escape-room-rochester-dr-watsons-infirmary,0,We did this for the first time last night and it was so much fun!! We had a great group of people and we each contributed in our own way. Dr Max helped keep us on track if he saw that we were going in the wrong direction. We got out with 1 second to spare!! I would definitely do it again!

We had various ages and everyone enjoyed themselves. The staff, Donald and Jasmine, were great and made the experience wonderful. Book ahead and plan for over an hour to be there."
