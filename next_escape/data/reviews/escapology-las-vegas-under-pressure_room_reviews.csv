"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-las-vegas-under-pressure,0,"If you're looking for something really fun to do and haven't tried an escape room yet, I highly recommend it. We had the best time escaping from the Under Pressure submarine-themed rooms. The rooms are clean and interesting and will challenge you, but the awesome staff will help you as well if you need a hint or two. Fabulous activity for a group of six or eight to do. Haven't had this much fun in a while."

Our team made it out with 2 seconds to spare. Give this room or any the others a try, I think you will have lots of fun we did!"
