"Escape room ""Homecoming: Part 2"" by Fargo Escape Room in Fargo",https://worldofescapes.com/west-fargo/quests/fargo-escape-room-framed,0,"Absolutely awesome! Managed to get out with around 5 minutes to spare and using 5 hints. The staff was amazing - super funny and helpful. I liked the aspect that if you used a hint, you lost a minute of time. The hints were very helpful and timely. It was difficult, but doable. We had a great team! A great way to spend an hour with friends and family! Can't wait to do it again."

It was down to the wire for our team but the clues and the hints and the game in general were all totally worth it. The staff was friendly and enthusiastic. It was difficult but not impossible, there were a lot of things to do and even though there were eight of us we were always working on something. An incredible way to spend an hour!"
