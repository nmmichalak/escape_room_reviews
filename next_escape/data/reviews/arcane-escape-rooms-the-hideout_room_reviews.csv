The staff (Scott) was very patient and thorough with all our questions. Our team lived through ""The Agency"" and beat the record time for the week! Can't wait to return and try ""The Hideout""."

A bit different than most of the rooms I do, but it was thoroughly engaging and really well done for the space. My group cannot stop raving about this one! It is definitely challenging and fun!!! Their Agent room is also a great, but we did prefer The Hideout unanimously."

We had a blast in the Hideout room and we will definitely be back for more. Can't wait for new rooms to be added too!! Staff was amazing (Scott, we loved you!) and the thought that went into this is mind-blowing!"
