"Escape room ""Zombie Roadhouse"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-orlando-zombie-roadhouse,0,This was our first time we only had 3 in our group but there was 11 total and all of us were first timers. We had a blast. We worked with total strangers and it didn't matter. Story line and room was fantastic. I would so do this again. We had the zombie room.... zombies won this time.

"Escape room ""Zombie Roadhouse"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-orlando-zombie-roadhouse,2,"Zombie Roadhouse was one of our favorite escape rooms yet! It's their hardest room and is designed for a maximum of 14 people. We did not escape but there was only 2 of us and we were super close! This was different to other rooms we have tried because it was non-linear, but it was still good fun. The staff were great and really added to the atmosphere. If you're taking a trip to Orlando I would definitely give this a go! Especially if it is raining!"

The two games we played were incredibly difficult for just four people. Zombie roadhouse was a thoughtful challenge. Can't wait to go back and do espionage!

Really enjoyed the puzzles in the Zombie Roadhouse, and working in such a large group (my husband and I, and a group of 7 others). Definitely going back to try the other rooms."
