"Escape room ""Special Ops"" by The Escape Game Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/the-escape-game-nashville-special-ops,0,"My family had an amazing experience at the escape game. We played special ops, the newest game. For those who have played before it is kind of like a combination of classified and mission mars. We had a fantastic experience from our warm welcome and easy check-in to a quality picture after escaping; Jordan, Jacob, and Kyle took care of us well. As someone who has played multiple escape rooms with multiple companies, The Escape Game really is the cream of the crop. Even as relatively experienced players we were still challenged and had an overall amazing experience. A truly epic way to spend an evening."

We played the special ops room and it was filled with great challenges. The clues helped jus the right amount to get us looking in the right direction but never gave anything away.
