She was very professional, fun and guided us along our way. Once inside our room, we found the setup, clues and hints very well organized. The mystery was fantastic! Overall this was a very challenging room for our family of 4 which was exactly what we wanted. We didn't escape, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend Katlynn, this company, and this room."
