"Escape room ""Legends of a Hidden Temple"" by LI Escape Game in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-game-li-legends-of-a-hidden-temple,0,Decided to come here with the family this summer and we had an absolute blast. We completed the Legend of the Hidden Temple with 5 minutes left! Brittany was the escape room host and she was very helpful and wonderful. I would highly recommend coming here.

Brittney made the experience amazing by keeping us on our toes, giving us moments of clarity, and was so enthusiastic about us representing the Silver Snakes. We dug through sand, crawled through secret tunnels, and escaped with 6 minutes left! DEFINITELY using our passport to do another game, maybe even all of them!"
