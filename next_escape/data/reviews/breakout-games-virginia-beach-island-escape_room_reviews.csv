"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/breakout-games-virginia-beach-island-escape,1,"This is the best place in VB for escape rooms. The rooms are awesome and the staff is great. Other rooms limit you to 3 questions and aren't always as creative with the rooms. We have completed the 2 new rooms, Do not Disturb and Island Escape. Still hard to say which one is our favorite as they are so unique but all fun. Island Escape was a blast. Definitely check this place our and you won't be disappointed. We can't wait for more new rooms!"

Our second one was hostage and our game master was PB&Jordi and she was amazing as well. We made it out with less than 2 minutes to spare. We will definitely be going back!!"
