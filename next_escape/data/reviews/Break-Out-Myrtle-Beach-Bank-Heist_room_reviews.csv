"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Break Out Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/Break-Out-Myrtle-Beach-Bank-Heist,0,We did the CSI room a couple of years ago and loved the experience. This year we did Bank Heist and had so much fun we came back another day and did the Zombie one. We love these and the staff is great. Great fun on a rainy day or a break from the heat.

Got to do it with my family (4 people) and it was a great time. Needed a few clues but we did it with one minute left. The owner was very friendly and nice to talk to. I definitely would recommend it!

Cab rides to and from cost double what the Breakout did....and it was TOTALLY worth it! We had soooo much fun! And talk about a great test for marriage! Seriously, we raved about the experience for the next three days and it is still out favorite outing from that week."
