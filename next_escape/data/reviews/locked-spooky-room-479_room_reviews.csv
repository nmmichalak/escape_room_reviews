"Escape room ""Spooky Room 479"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-spooky-room-479,0,"Amazing game! We did the Spooky Room 479. The production value was incredible. This was my second escape room and it blew the first one away. The setup of the room was simple yet intricate. The technology incorporated in the room was incredible.  With just the three of us, believe it or not, we actually escaped with 5 seconds left on the clock! Highly recommend this one!"

My friends and I successfully escaped with only 2 mins left on the clock. Very impressive game! I will definitely recommend this place.

"Escape room ""Spooky Room 479"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-spooky-room-479,3,"I've done Escape Rooms for the past two years in various cities and I have to say that the Spooky Room at Locked was very impressive and had some neat bells, whistles, and puzzles I had never seen before.  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful and laid out all the rules clearly before letting us begin.  All the puzzles in the Spooky Room made sense and had fairly elegant solutions...and I must admit, the spooky atmosphere was creepy but not terrifying.  Not too many red herrings either which was nice.  Get a group of friends together and challenge yourself to Locked!  "
"Escape room ""Spooky Room 479"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-spooky-room-479,4,"Wow! What a ""game changer"" this is for a night out. I went here with a couple of my friends on Friday night to check out the escape hype and I must say--the experience by far exceeded my expectations. It's incredibly easy to get to: It's located at the last stop right off the N Q stop off Astoria-Ditmars and it's tucked away right next to McDonalds. I caved to do the ""Spooky Room 479"". This room was by far the coolest and most challenging. We finished the room in just the amount of time.. after being a chicken at some points in the room. Overall, this is an experience definitely worth trying (more than once). It was a great way to bond with my friends and challenges you in ways you wouldn't even imagine. I want more!"
