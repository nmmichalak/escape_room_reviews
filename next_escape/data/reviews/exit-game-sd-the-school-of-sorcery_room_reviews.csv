"Escape room ""The School of Sorcery"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-school-of-sorcery,0,"My friends and I have done almost every room here. Every room is consistently great, and the puzzles are challenging and varied. The staff is helpful and friendly and clearly love puzzles. I would say that the production values for this place are above average, and the puzzle flow and style is friendly to large groups. I can't say much more without spoiling something, go!"

The story was smart and engaging. The puzzles kept us (our team of two) busy and challenged. The decor was immersive and made sense.I can't wait to play their new games coming on the next months. Exit Games is on my ""highly recommended"" list!"
