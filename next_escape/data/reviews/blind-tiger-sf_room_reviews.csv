"Escape room ""Blind Tiger"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/blind-tiger-sf,0,"I went to EscapeSF with 4 other friends to do the Blind Tiger room. I've done about 15-20 escape rooms total at this point and it solidly lands in the middle in terms of enjoyment. We escaped with a little over 10 minutes left.The setup was pretty cool but I felt that the puzzles were a little rudimentary and seemingly a little random at times. They also did not really tie together all that well in my honest opinion. We also had quite a few components of the room that were broken when we went which further detracted from the quality of the experience. All in all, I still enjoyed the room, but I don't feel that it is as good as other reviews would lead you to think it is."

"Escape room ""Blind Tiger"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/blind-tiger-sf,4,"My second time ever doing an Escape room and I would say EscapeSF is AMAZING! Hands down. The location doesn't stick out too much but you can't really miss it on Kearny! You can take public transportation or even drive and park at that underground parking lot of the play ground if you'd like.I got a LivingSocial deal and thought, why not! $80 is a steal. Especially since the weekend evening price was $139 or something. But hence the fact when you purchase the deal that they have restricting days for certain pricing! Following the instructions of booking your reservation is super easy, but I was a little confused if Antique room was the only option for booking or if the link provided to book had Antique's page as default trying to book a time with EscapeSF. So we ended up doing the Antique room and LOVED IT! Though my friends (3 others) and I didn't succeed, I had tons of fun!The main reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a few times where my friends and I had no idea what triggered us to solving some of the puzzles... Sometimes they would just happen. I guess I'm just comparing my first experience of doing an escape room and they had where you had to unlock a bunch of stuff so I was expecting that but nonetheless, this concept was SICK. P.S.: Tiffany and Allison were awesome employees! Getting us started and answered our questions in the end. AND they're coming out with a third room - Blind Tiger - coming out in August!!! I can't wait to go back!"
