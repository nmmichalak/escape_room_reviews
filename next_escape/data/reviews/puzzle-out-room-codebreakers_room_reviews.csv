"Escape room ""Codebreakers"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-codebreakers,0,"This is by far the best escape room in the area! Checked out both locations, in Hoboken and Jersey City, and had a great time at each place. You can't go wrong going to either location. Great alternative to the typical night out. Skip the movies and go here!"
"Escape room ""Codebreakers"" by Puzzle Out Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-out-room-codebreakers,1,"So much fun! The location is super convenient; for people driving in, there's a parking garage about a block away that's reasonably priced, which is a great welcome if you're trying to deal with street parking in Hoboken. It's also right across the street from the PATH station. We were a small group of 3, of which 2 have never played 'escape the room' so I was a bit worried about being able to get out of the room in 1 hour (we got out in time). Solving the puzzles are a lot of fun, and I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun challenge. Instructions are very clear, and the guy working there is super nice."

You kind of lose yourself in it, the setup was nice, the puzzles were lots of fun, and trying to beat the clock is pretty exciting. The guy working there is pretty hot too but he said he was married. None the less, it was a lot of fun!"
