"Escape room ""The Fallout Shelter"" by The Great Escape TX in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/the-great-escape-tx-the-fallout-shelter,0,Been to several escape rooms in Houston. This one is by far the best. You can see the dedication that the owner has for making every detail as immersive as possible. The puzzles were actually fun instead of looking for a bunch of keys. I highly reccomend this place. The owner is super nice too. I cannot wait to see the rooms he comes up with next!

Came here yesterday with a group of friends for my birthday. We had a great time trying to solve the intricate puzzles. The storyline made the escape more interesting, as well as the special effects. Allen was a great guide, giving us little nudges when we needed it. Highly recommend this experience and looking forward to the next escape!"
