"Escape room ""Assassination Express"" by Escapology Covington in Covington",https://worldofescapes.com/covington/quests/escapology-covington-assassination-express,0,What a fun night. Steven Palmisano was a great helper. Couldn't have asked for better. We played Assassination Express to save FDR. We had five minutes to spare. Cute use of clues. The room was a mess when we finished!
