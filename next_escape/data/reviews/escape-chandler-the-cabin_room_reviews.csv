"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by ESCAPE:chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-chandler-the-cabin,0,5/5 stars for Escape:Chandler! We’ve done The Cabin and The Pawn Shop. Both rooms are immersive and have great designs. It’s clear the owners put much thought into their themes and room decoration. The owners also exude passion for what they do and make the experience even better. The puzzles flow well and are fun to solve. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thanks for the great time!

The Cabin is just the right amount of spooky and creepy suspense. The owner/gamemaster was so good at her job, so we felt the experience was amazing. We will be back!"

We did the cabin theme and had SO much fun! Zuzu was great, super friendly and explained everything really well. We escaped with 23 seconds left! We definitely want to come back and do the other rooms."
