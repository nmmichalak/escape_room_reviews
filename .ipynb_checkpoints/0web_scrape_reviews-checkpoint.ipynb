      "This was so fun! We took our kids and we did the \"Imprisoned\" room. It was a surprise for all 5 of our kids, ranging from 10-15. We really had to work as a team and managed to escape with just a minute to spare! There were smiles the rest of the day and continual praise for the experience!The staff could not be more amazing! I already want to go back!\n",
      "My husband and I just did the imprisoned challenge, and we will definitely be repeat customers. The staff was cheerful and helpful, and the clues they gave were great as well. We were floored by the details that went into our room, and we had a blast trying to keep track of all the clues. The puzzles were the right amount of challenging, and they throw in some fantastic twists that made it even better. We hadn't even left the parking lot before we started planning our next trip back. I can't recommend it enough!\n",
      "We had a group of seven, which included five 13-year-olds, solving the \"Imprisoned\" room, and it was so great! The staff was very helpful and friendly, from the booking of the room and the party space to the end of the game and clean up. I highly recommend!\n",
      "I had the chance to visit Auburn Escape Zones with my coworkers. We had a large group so we broke into 2 teams. My team escaped the Prison room. It was so much fun and a great way to work together. They will be changing a few of the rooms soon so there will be new rooms to escape!I highly recommend fir families or friends looking for something to do in Auburn/Opelika!\n",
      "They said the difficulty of the Imprisoned room was \"medium,\" but it was definitely a hard medium. Looking forward to going back and trying another room! Had a lot of fun!\n"

I would never feel the need to write this but I do feel that, as business owners, we live in a world where customers are able to review us but we, as business owners, are not given the opportunity to respond. While I am grateful to have customers play and avidly try to make it through the game, I also need to ensure that my prop decor, investments in making the rooms authentic and detailed, and game pieces do not get damaged- so that other players can play the game as well. During the game, it was clear that there was not a lot of respect for the facility or objects in the game room. (NOTE: some of the books in the rooms are antiques that were gifted to us with the intent of us caring for them; I intend to uphold that responsibility. As well, if a game piece is damaged, it can impact the game experience of people who are scheduled to play following that game). During game play, I observed the two of them dropping and damaging items in the room, kicking gaming pieces with their feet to move them after they'd dropped them on the floor and walking on top of materials. This is not how many of our participants and visitors play. While it may have appeared that I was ushering them out of the room with the intent of going to lunch; I did not go to lunch (despite the fact that I'm quite sure many other humans do)- I just didn't want to have them play any other games especially not our Gold Rush room which is stocked with many items that are over 110 years old. Regarding the difficulty of the game, while experienced gamers may make it out with time on the clock, there are still a lot of players in our area that have never played a game before and we work to ensure that all gamers escape. Our escape games are different (we note that 'everyone escapes' on our website) and we think that people enjoy the positive experience. While we can't please everyone, we do think preservation of the experience for other players is more important than allowing our games to be damaged for solely two people. While input is always appreciated, as business owners, we weigh out cost and benefit on a regular basis. It was my decision that it was potentially more costly to have the two of them play another game than it was beneficial. As well, if our experience was so bad, I'm not sure why the two of them asked to play another game. \",\n",
       "    'The game itself was enjoyable, if shorter than we were used to. My sister and I got out with 20 minutes to spare and we looked through every inch of space in the room (which, for anyone that’s done a hard escape room before, is the trademark of an experienced team. You have to go through everything to avoid missing an “obvious” clue). The woman running the show was the reason for the bad review. She had her boyfriend stop in before we entered the room and told him that after she was finished here that they could grab food. She’s allowed to have a personal life, sure, but shooing customers out the door after they beat the game saying she has “a thing to do” is just unprofessional. We told her that we had an interest in doing another game (there were no bookings after us) and she told us that she it was doable with 2 people, but she “would rather not have [us] in that room because *this* (gestures around to the scattered items of the room) can’t happen in that room”...it was extremely rude. Then she went on to complain about how LONG it’s going to take her to clean up and that she’s never seen this level of “disaster” in the room before. The staff was unprofessional and I’ve never felt the need to leave a scathing review for anyone. Ever. Feel free to enjoy the game itself, but don’t get in the way of the employee’s free time...',\n",
