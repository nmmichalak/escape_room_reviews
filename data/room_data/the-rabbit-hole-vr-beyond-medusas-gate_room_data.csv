Somewhere on the Peloponnese peninsula, in a vast Aegean coastal cave, an old artifact has been hidden. It could be the legendary ship of the Argonauts.

 You will experience a larger-than-life adventure as if you were there, 445 BCE in Ancient Greece. Never alone, as part of a team of 2 or 4, you become the hero and experience situations that would be far too dangerous or just impossible in real life.
