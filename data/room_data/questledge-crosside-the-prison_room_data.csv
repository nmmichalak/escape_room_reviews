You have been a victim of an inequitable system of justice and corrupt villains. But you are hardly defeated, you’re a tough nut to crack! With your wits and courage, you can avoid the death penalty. But how to do that? The answer you will find in an old, dirty cell. Your friends still have their freedom though. The escape plan is all set, and now you’ll need all the courage, all the cunning, and all the luck you have to get to freedom and clear your name. And to carry on your fight for justice.

CrossSide: The Prison is not a video game. It is an escape game experience set in a dilapidated prison in virtual reality. You will experience a realistic adventure as if you were there. Never alone, as part of a team (of 2 or 4), you become the hero and experience in totally safe situations that would be far too dangerous or just impossible to live in real life.
