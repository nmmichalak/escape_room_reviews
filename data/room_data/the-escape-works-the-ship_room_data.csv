Buckingham, who has been known to share his wealth in outrageous publicity stunts (like the time he rented the Goodyear blimp and dropped millions of dollars over neighbourhoods of Los Angeles), has lately taken to dressing, acting, and talking like a pirate. In a press release, Buckingham claims to have hidden “possibly the most valuable treasure ever,” in an old clipper ship that he has permanently docked near his mansion.
