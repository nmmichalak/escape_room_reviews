"Escape room ""Oval Office"" by Exithis Pensacola in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/exithis-oval-office,"1207 Creighton Rd, Pensacola FL 32503","The Office of the POTUS has been compromised! There is a bomb set to detonate in T-minus 60 minutes. 
Your Special Weapons and Tactics team has been called in to neutralize the threat but thereâ€™s a catch...the nuclear football containing the launch sequence has been tampered with and we need you to translate the codes. You have whatever time is left on that bomb (when you find it) to save yourselves and the free world. Good luck and may God have mercy on us all. ",4-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
