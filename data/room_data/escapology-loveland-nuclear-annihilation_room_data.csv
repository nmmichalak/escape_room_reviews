The existing timeline that we all know has been illegally changed and you and your team have been tasked to stop Fidel Castro, leader of Cuba, from launching nuclear missiles upon the United States and causing Nuclear Annihilation.
You will be transported to a “Safe Room” located just off Fidel Castro’s private office moments before the attack to destroy a secret launch code document. The document was hidden by Ramon Castro, a master of game theory and older brother of Fidel Castro. In just over 60 minutes, the time ripples of this illegal change will reach the present and our future will be changed forever.",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
