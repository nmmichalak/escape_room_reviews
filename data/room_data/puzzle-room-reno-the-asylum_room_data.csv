One by one, the town's residents become consumed with crazed delusions and are being admitted. Those who have gone mad appear to get worse after entering the hospital doors. Each one telling stories of paranoia.
Patterns have been appearing in the jumbled sentences murmured from within. But as soon as too much is spoken people mysteriously disappear, with no trace left behind. You are one of the few sane ones left... at least, that's what you thought before you woke up a prisoner in the asylum yourself. Uncover the mystery and escape before it's too late.",3-6,60,Difficult,A little scary,,None
