With rooms hard to find in town, you were lucky to have the owner of a B&B call to offer you rooms when they heard you were the headliner. Youâ€™ve separated into two groups to get dressed for the big show. As soon as you enter the dressing rooms, you hear the doors shut and the click of the locks! The check-in deadline is an hour from now, so you only have 60 minutes to ESCAPE the room and make it to the festival on time.",4-10,60,Average,Not scary,15+,None
