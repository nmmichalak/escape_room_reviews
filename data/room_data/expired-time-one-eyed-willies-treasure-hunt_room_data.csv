After months out to sea, he discovered the treasure that contained many jewels and doubloons. After stowing away his booty and setting many booby traps along the way to protect it, he set sail to return to his homeland of Astoria. Before he would make it back home, his ship was attacked, and One-Eyed Willie was captured. His captors tied up Willie in hopes of finding the treasure on board. Without any luck and no help from Willie, they did not find his hidden treasure and left Willie to die aboard his ship.
