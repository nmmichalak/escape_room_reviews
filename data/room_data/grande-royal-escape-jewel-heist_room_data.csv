It is a normal trip for people of your social status but unlike the other well to do tourists riding with you, you are taking this trip for a reason other than sunshine.
You have a job to do, one last job before you can retire as a master jewel thief. The biggest prize you have ever sought, the Peacock Diamonds that are only a couple of walls away. If you can steal those jewels and disappear into the night not only will you be rich, you will be legendary.
