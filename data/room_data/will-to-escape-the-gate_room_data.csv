"Escape room ""The Gate"" by Will to Escape in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/will-to-escape-the-gate,"1150 Town Center Dr Jupiter, FL 33458","The hidden door to an Egyptian tomb was unearthed during a top secret excavation project. We've learned the tomb is a gateway to a ancient curse that will unleash darkness upon the world if released. To protect humanity, a clandestine military organization built a device that deploys a barrier around the gate.  The device is the only thing that protects the world from the powers that lie beyond this realm. But the device can't hold.  With every passing minute, the device grows weaker as the curse becomes stronger.

You and your team are our last hope!  You must crack the code, enter the tomb, and finally put the curse to rest.

Good luck explorers.  The world is counting on you.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
