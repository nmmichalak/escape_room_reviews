Upside Down"" by Nightwalker Caverns Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/nightwalker-caverns-escape-rooms-the-clownatorium,"6760 University Ave #100 San Diego, CA 92115","Your friend, Barb, vanished while cutting through a closed-down carnival on her way to the Arcade where you all hang out. The carnival is owned by evil Nightwalker Clowns who live in underground caverns beneath the carnival. 
You’ve heard stories about others who entered the old carnival and were never seen again, but you’ve found Barb’s backpack outside an unlocked door to the mirror maze building, and you’ve got to find her. When you open the door, it will set off an alarm and the on-duty Security Clown will be alerted. The Clown will notify his evil employers that trespassers are inside the carnival. 
The Clown will try to scare you and divert your attention from finding Barb, but he secretly wants you to escape so he’s left you clues in Clue boxes around the Carnival. It takes 90 minutes for the Nightwalker Clowns to get to the carnival from their underground caverns. You need to find Barb and escape before they arrive.",4-10,90,Very difficult,None,12+,None
