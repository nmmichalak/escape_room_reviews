Not knowing why, you believed him and spent the last three years following your best friend. He demonstrated and taught you things you never thought would be possible.
Three days ago he was brutally beaten and hung in total humiliation. He was then moved to a tomb never to be seen alive again. This morning you were informed his body is MISSING and the tomb is empty. Is it possible that the prophecies of old were true, and he is now the risen King of Kings?
You and the other disciples (your team) gather in the upper room to recount his last words and search the clues of the empty tomb. Can you find the Kingdom Keys that will open the door to receive your Gift from the Father of your friends Kingdom, where He rules as King of Kings and Lord of Lords... Do you have what it takes to return as Kings and Priests among men in only 60 minutes?",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary, 38 %,0.38
