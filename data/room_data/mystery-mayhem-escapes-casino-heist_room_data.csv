Run by a ruthless mob boss whose operation is protected by crooked politicians and public officials. No one has ever tried to steal from ""the Boss"" and lived to tell about it. Until now...
You have devised the perfect plan, or so you think. It is very risky, but you have managed to persuade one of the dealers to be your ""inside man"". He will be responsible for getting everyone out of the casino to give you a very short window in which to get the job done.
All of the poker chips, money, and other valuables you find will be split up among the team members. Your ""inside man"" only wants a priceless diamond necklace for his payment. Make sure you make this necklace your priority or he will take this as a double-cross and won't hesitate to turn you in. You can probably guess what happens after that.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
