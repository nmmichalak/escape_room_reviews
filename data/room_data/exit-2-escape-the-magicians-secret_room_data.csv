Since then many stories have surfaced about a secret parlor and a journal it contained, rumored to be full of Houdini’s greatest plans for new illusions, death defying escapes, and all his secrets that led to his fame.

Over the years the old Theater has been forgotten, but suddenly things have changed. Strange sounds have been heard, lights seen… And most recently mail delivered addressed in Houdini’s name. It’s up to you to solve the mystery, to find what people have searched for in vain, you have 60 minutes inside to retrieve it, then escape or be forever trapped in the parlor stuck in this game!",3-10,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
