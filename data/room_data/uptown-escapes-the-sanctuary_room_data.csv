"Escape room ""The Sanctuary"" by Uptown Escapes in Shelby",https://worldofescapes.com/shelby/quests/uptown-escapes-the-sanctuary,"213 S Washington St Shelby, NC 28150","It's been years since the lights went out. Civilization is in shambles. All forms of government have crumbled. After the blackout, cities were razed to ash as different factions desperately tried to seize power. There remains, however, one small ray of hope: Sanctuary. You’ve seen the signs, painted crudely on billboards and underpasses. A safe place, open to all, where your worries will finally be relieved.
You have had an uphill journey making your way to Sanctuary’s gates. You are relieved to be here, but there is unquestionably something strange about this refuge. As you enter the gates and approach the welcoming headquarters, the other inhabitants will not look you in the eye. Could this be the place you've hoped for? A place to rebuild and start over? Or is this Sanctuary just a prison in disguise?",2-8,70,Difficult,A little scary,15+,0.28
