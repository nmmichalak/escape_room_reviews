Through a series of anonymous leads, we have probable cause to believe Mr. Parker has acquired millions of dollars in stolen gold bars. At just over $40,000 per bar (1000g), we believe Mr. Parker has been selling the bullion on the black market.
We think someone has tipped off Mr. Parker that the Snake River Bureau of Investigations is on to him. It is presumed Mr. Parker has left the country. We do not know to where he fled or if he has plans on returning.
We do know he used his business as a cover for secretly selling bullion. We have in hand, a signed search warrant to enter his office to search and/or recover any evidence of the stolen property.
It is up to you, as a member of the elite task force for the Snake River Bureau of Investigations, to accomplish this task.",2-5,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
