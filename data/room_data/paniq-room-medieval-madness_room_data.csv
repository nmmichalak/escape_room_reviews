‘Tis truly a dark day for thee. Ye hath chosen a life of wanton abandon, debauchery, and depravity, rejecting goodness and patience for the sake of carnal pleasures. But ye cannot escape judgment forever, and the time hath come for ye to make thine penance through wound and blood. Here in this place of horrifying torture and punishment will ye spend thine final hours before a painful end followed by judgment to the eternal place where the flames are ne’er extinguished.

But the Lord promiseth forgiveness for those who seek Him still. Free thyself from this imprisonment and flee to the welcoming arms of thine Redeemer! Repent and confess thine sins to the Lord before thine soul is lost to the darkness forever, and He will set ye free indeed!",2-7,60,Difficult,None,10+,None
