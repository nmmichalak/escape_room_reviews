While you and some friends are at a dinner party at the Mayfield Manor, you hear gunshots and stumble into the study to hide out only to find yourself locked inside. You have 55 minutes to figure out the secrets before the cops, or worse the mobsters, show up and you do not want to be there when that happens.",8-14,55,Average,Not scary,10+,None
