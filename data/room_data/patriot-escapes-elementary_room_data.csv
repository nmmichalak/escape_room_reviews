German nationalists anxious to make good on the Third Reich's previous attempt to dominate the world have captured Professor Frankenschnitzel in an attempt to extract his knowledge but their aggressive methods only served to terminate the goose that may have had the secret to manufacturing golden eggs.
Before he was captured, the professor mailed an envelope to your office containing a letter and some other interesting items. He wants you to find and protect his greatest treasure and you have just 60 minutes to get in and out of his office before the bad guys show up. Good luck.",2-7,60,Difficult,Not scary,12+,None
