"Escape room ""Terror on the Titanic"" by Escape Waukesha in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-waukesha-terror-on-the-titanic,"2335 Silvernail Rd Pewaukee, WI 53072","Welcome aboard the RMS Titanic; your employer John Jacob Ashtor has decided to move to America with his family and most trusted staff members. One night as you are all preparing his room for slumber, the boat jerks back and forth and John Jacob Ashtor runs frantically into the room. He finds the members of his family and races to the deck yelling, “THE TITANIC IS SINKING.” Sure enough, after a member of your group returns from the deck, he tells you all that the boat has hit an iceberg and the only way you can all make it into a lifeboat is if you pay the crew member $50,000. John Jacob Ashtor never went a day without bragging about his jewels and money stored inside of his secure safe room.

If you and your fellow employees can get into the room and find the precious gems, then not only will you be able to make it off the boat, you will also never have to work again when you arrive in America. Do you have what it takes to retrieve the jewels? The crew member can only hold your spots for 60mins… can you make it to the lifeboat or will you sink under pressure?",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
