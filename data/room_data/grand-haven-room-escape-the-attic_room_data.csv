Your deranged Uncle Frank has not let anyone go in the attic for over 30 years. Some say Uncle Frank locked Aunt Bea in the attic many years ago. Others say she would go to the attic to get away from Uncle Frank. Either way, your curiosity gets the better of you, so when Uncle Frank leaves to go to the store, you decide to sneak into the attic. What you didn’t count on was that the door locked behind you and you find yourself trapped in the attic.

Who are those strange looking people in the photos? What happened to Uncle Frank’s car collection? Was Aunt Bea really a disco dancer? And most important…….whatever happened to Aunt Bea?

There are many questions that need answered, but Uncle Frank will be back in 1 hour.
