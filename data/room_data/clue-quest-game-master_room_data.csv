"Escape room ""Game Master"" by Clue Quest in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/clue-quest-game-master,"151 E. 33rd Suite 101 Edmond, OK 73013","I am the Game Master. There is no other. I am a great connoisseur of all sorts of games. There is a game that I have found that far surpasses all others and it resides inside the human mind. Every game has rules. Your rules are very simple. Within the boundaries of the room are clues. Put the clues together and you can get out before I come back (I am cruel but fair). Many others have failed. How sad for them. How very, very sad.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
