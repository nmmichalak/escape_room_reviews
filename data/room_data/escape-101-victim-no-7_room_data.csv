No witnesses, nothing left behind, and worse, no suspects. Could someone, or something, be to blame? No one knows what compelled them to enter the forest, or where they are now. Except you.
You’re now faced with the same fate as the others before you, likely in your final hours. Where are you? Who brought you here and how will you be the first to survive? A myriad of obstacles stands between you and your freedom. You’ll unearth those answers and other chilling details as you fight to escape before it’s too late.",2-12,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
