Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-the-safe-house,"3301 E Royalton Rd Broadview Heights, OH 44147","Congratulations, you’re CIA agents! As top agents in your field, you’ve been tasked with an important mission. As you know, we agents have strategic safe houses and identities to assume. 
We received information that one of our own has gone rouge. The rogue agent had been operating under the alias Arthur Moore, an accomplished runner and part-time mechanic. All while Arthur Moore has gone missing, our system has been hacked and your identities have all been compromised, along with safe house locations across the world. 
We have reason to believe rogue agent Arthur Moore and the at-risk information are connected. If this information is leaked, your safety is at risk. The flash drive that holds this information is tucked away somewhere in the safe house. We are sending all of you to the safe house to see if you can outwit the blackened agent and find the flash drive. With money and security at risk, terrorist groups are hot on the trail to recover this information before you sleuth your way through Arthur Moore’s safe house. 
You are our last chance to recover this information before our identities and safety are exposed!",2-12,60,Difficult,Not scary,12+,None
