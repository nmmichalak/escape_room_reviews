WWII wages overseas, but here in Charleston, SC, a more personal battle was being fought. Inga Arvad, a Danish-born beauty queen and journalist, and a young Naval Intelligence Officer and future President named John F. Kennedy, Jr. are madly in love. Unfortunately, the odds are stacked against them.

While working as a reporter in Europe, Inga caught the eye of Hitler and became his favorite journalist. Could she be a Nazi spy? The FBI thinks so. JFK’s influential father doesn’t approve of Inga and had his son re-assigned to Charleston’s naval base in an effort to break up the relationship. Undeterred, Inga regularly travels to meet her love at the Fort Sumter Hotel in Charleston. But, Inga’s not alone. The FBI is watching her every move and listening to every conversation.

With both the FBI and the powerful Kennedy family working against them, our young couple needs your help to save their relationship and protect their reputations. Your mission is to enter Room 132 of the Fort Sumter Hotel to retrieve FBI surveillance recordings and remove hidden microphones. Be careful though. The FBI has installed alarms on their equipment to keep it from falling into the wrong hands. Make a wrong step and you’ll end up in jail.
