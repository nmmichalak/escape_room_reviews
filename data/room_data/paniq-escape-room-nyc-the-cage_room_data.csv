"Escape room ""The Cage, the Cards, and the Cash"" by PanIQ Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/paniq-escape-room-nyc-the-cage,"102 Eldridge St, New York, NY 10002","Big River is a town on the rise. Gold’s been found in the hills, makin’ it a bustlin’ little burg overnight. Yessir, this here town’s got a lot to celebrate, which is why ol’ Charlie decided to host the biggest poker game of these territories – a $10,000 stake, held in waiting in Charlie’s saloon. But that’s just too sweet a pot for you and yer crew to ignore.
Lucky fer you, the saloon’s got a backdoor that heads right into Sheriff Portman’s office. It won’t take much to get you thrown into a cell, and sharin’ a little coin with his two-bit deputy Findley will get Sheriff out of town for a good hour. Time fer an old-fashioned jailbreak so you can get into Charlie’s Place to grab that loot before the law gets back. Hop to it, outlaws! Yer burnin’ daylight!",2-7,60,Very difficult,Not scary,10+,None
