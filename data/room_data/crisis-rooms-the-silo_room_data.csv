"Escape room ""The Silo"" by Crisis Rooms in Frankfort",https://worldofescapes.com/frankfort/quests/crisis-rooms-the-silo,"20861 South La Grange Road Frankfort, IL 60423","Air Force facility missile Site 13 (579-9) was built in 1963 and was scheduled to be decommissioned in 1987. As part of President Ronald Reagan's weapon systems modernization program, all operational Titan 2 Silos throughout the country were to be demolished. However, Site 13 was ultra-classified and only to be used in cases of extreme National Security; therefore the location and even the existence of Site 13 was only known by a hand full of people; none of which was the President. Between the years of 1965 and 1980, these people died and the existence of Site 13 was completely forgotten. Now, in 2018 a hacker happened upon the system, and not knowing what it was has awoken the launch computer and inadvertently started the countdown. You have 60 Minutes to find the manual override to abort the launch. The fate of the world is in your hands!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,None
