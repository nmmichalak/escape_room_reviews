"Escape room ""The Mine Shaft"" by HD Escape Rooms Westminster in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/hd-escape-rooms-westminster-the-mine-shaft,"8951 N Harlan St Westminster, CO 80031","With the construction of the Westminster mall, crews have discovered the entrance to one of the original mine shafts from Deadwood Mining Co. At the peak of the Colorado Gold Rush, miners would stake their claim on any land they could get their hands on, hoping to strike it rich. Even then, Shaft #13 was always a very mysterious mine, as it was dug under the town’s boot hill cemetery. After several years of operation, the mine shut down when its mining crew never surfaced. Some say it was the mine gasses, other say a cave-in swallowed them whole. If you decide to enter the mine shaft, just remember: ”If the canary ain’t tweetin’…you’ll be sleepin’!”
