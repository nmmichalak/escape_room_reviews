He decides to retreat to his cabin far away from civilization to record the extraordinary discovery from his latest research. Quite some time has passed since his retreat and no one has seen or heard from him in months. It's as if he vanished without a trace!
Rumor has it that many of the doctor's discoveries revolved around ancient myths and folklore, with some believing his natural curiosity got the better of him.
