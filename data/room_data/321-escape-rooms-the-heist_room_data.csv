"Escape room ""The Heist"" by 321 Escape Rooms in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/321-escape-rooms-the-heist,"5270 N US HWY 1 Palm Shores, FL 32940","The year is 1851 and you are heading out West in hopes of making a name for yourself. Hazed by women, booze and gambling, you have developed quite a large sum of debt. In one last desperate attempt to try and “hit it big”, you borrow money from the infamous Mad Dog McNaulty. After you lose it all again, you're facing a deadline and the wrath of the outlaw.

After a few days of thinking, there is just one viable option left – pull off a heist at the local bank. You have one hour to follow the clues and get into the vault. This could be it – you could pay off Mad Dog and if all goes to plan – you will become the most famous bank robber in the West!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,0.46
