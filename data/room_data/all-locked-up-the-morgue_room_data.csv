This key had a tag that read ""Brookhart City Morgue."" This can only lead to bad things. Time to finish the Scott story that you started in The Classroom, and time to find out what is really going on with your neighbor. Can you handle this one? It's a real morgue; so freezers, death, body parts, and smells that might make you cringe. Come to The Morgue to find out what Scott has been up to this whole time. Bring some bravery and maybe even a Bible. Who knows what Death has in store for you and your team.",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,16+,None
