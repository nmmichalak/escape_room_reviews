"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Escape Experience - Nashville Escape Games in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/escape-experience-nashville-the-inheritance,"501 Union Street Nashville, TN 37219","It would seem that your distant yet eccentric uncle has suddenly passed away. Aside from rumors, you knew very little about your Uncle Nicky, only that he was a scientist of some sort and that he was very devoted to his work…

As a contingency plan for his death, your late uncle left hidden clues and instructions in his will for you to find and carry out. The Inheritance is a clue-like escape room that is part mystery and part mission. Arguably Nashville’s most challenging escape room, the details of this experience remain suspiciously vague.
