One particular hotel, built on top of an abandoned mine shaft, is said to be haunted by a young saloon girl who vanished from the property, but whose body was never found. Many people who have stayed at the hotel tell stories of unexplained happenings and whispering sounds coming from the walls.

Today is the 50 year anniversary of the day she disappeared. Your friends say you aren’t brave enough to handle the supernatural spirits that dwell within and have dared you to stay inside for one hour – until the clock strikes midnight. You don’t believe in ghosts, but as the door locks shut behind you and the light flickers, a chill runs down your spine. Can you last the hour? Or will you make a break for it and lose your dare?",4-8,60,Average,Scary,14+,0.42
