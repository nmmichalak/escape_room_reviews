A powerful race of aliens from a distant galaxy has been observing mankind for untold centuries. They have now chosen to make their presence known. Are they an intergalactic ally and force of good, or a dangerous threat to our species and planet? Now, at the apparent instruction of these aliens, your core team of volunteers will be teleported to a final testing facility in space. You will have exactly one hour of earth time to pass their tests and prove that humanity deserves its place among the stars. The stakes couldnâ€™t be higher. If you pass, their technology may offer unimaginable technological advances, but if you fail, it may mean the end of the human race.
