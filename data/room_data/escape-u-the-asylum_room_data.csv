When you awaken, you notice you are restrained and have a hood over your head.

You begin to formulate a plan to escape but just as you do the side effects of the force-fed medication start kicking in and everything changes. You must find a way to escape this new hell, all the while battling the side effects of the medication which begins to make you question your own sanity.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
