"Escape room ""Last Will"" by Escape Out of the Box in Zeeland",https://worldofescapes.com/zeeland/quests/escape-out-of-the-box-last-will,"114 E Main Ave Zeeland, MI 49464","Tragically, your eccentric Great Uncle Arthur has passed away. Growing up you've heard tales of his time exploring the open waters and the many adventures he found himself in the middle of. A spirit like Art's can't be kept down, and even in death, he has one final adventure to tell you about, yours.
His Last Will & Testament discloses that he has hidden your and your fellow New Adventurers' inheritance throughout his study. But there's a catch - you only get one hour to find it. As typical of his irreverent sense of humor, he hasn't made it easy! Do you have the same adventurous spirit that led to Art's love of a good old-fashioned treasure hunt?",3-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
