Robbing a rival boss, along with the whole Pascuzzi family, and Georgetown Trust & Loan... Even if it seems crazy. This is your first job, everything has to be just right so you can pass initiation and be a made man.

Luckily your inside associate has given you the perfect window after closing. You will get 1 hour to get in and out. That means 60 minutes to complete this final task, and if you don't... Youâ€™ll be pushing up daisies in no time.

Your crew has been carefully picked and assembled. Can you execute the job before time runs out? Or will you be getting whacked by a fellow mobster inside Georgetown Morgue Trust & Loan.",4-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,13+,None
