"Escape room ""The Theater"" by Upside Down Escape Games in Taunton",https://worldofescapes.com/taunton/quests/upside-down-escape-games-the-theater,"1 Washington St #500 Taunton, MA 02780","In a world…where people haven’t watched enough scary movies, a boy named Darryl decided to continue his birthday celebrations at a theater…a puppet theater. That’s right, as Darryl forces all of you to waltz into what’s obviously a house of horrors, he once again vanishes without a trace. A clock starts counting down from sixty minutes. You don’t know what happens when the clock reaches zero but you have a feeling it doesn’t involve party poppers. Can you save Darryl from this vague and ominous threat? What decade are we in? DID THAT PUPPET JUST LOOK AT ME?! We’re much less certain on the answers to these questions but we wish you luck in not being dead.
