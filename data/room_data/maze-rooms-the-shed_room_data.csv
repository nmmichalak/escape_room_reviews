"Escape room ""The Shed"" by Maze Rooms in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/maze-rooms-the-shed,"5555 N Lamar Blvd Suite K110, Austin, TX 78751","You’ve seen it all over the news- first the disappearances, but then the first body was found…or at least what was left of it. They’ve started to call him the “Capitol Cannibal”, and he’s still at large and terrorizing the streets of Austin, Texas. You keep listening to the tv in the background while preparing to head to a party tonight with some of your friends. A breaking news story brings your attention back to the television as one of the victims who escaped his clutches recounts how the Cannibal toys with his victims- locking them in his shed full of traps and compartments, and giving them an hour to escape with their lives. When asked to describe the killer they recall a man in a jumpsuit, a burlap mask, and a taunting, gravelly voice.

You hear the doorbell as your friends arrive to head to the party. You turn off the tv while trying to convince yourself that surely that will never happen to you… Or will it?",2-4,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
