The group lost their way hours ago with no sign of civilization. The once beautiful snow that lay still as glass providing the most scenic backdrop is proving to be more of an enemy rather than a hiking bonus.
After what seemed to be days’ worth of wondering, exhausting every survival tactic, you stumble upon a decrepit cabin. A cumulative sigh expels from the group like a well-orchestrated symphony. With newfound hope and the visions of a proper shelter, you enter The Cabin.
Upon entry, the piercing cold air slams the door behind you. It’s dark. You try to reopen the door to provide some light, but it won’t budge. Your group methodically tries to obtain their bearings. Gathering supplies, and finding light sources, something doesn’t seem right.
The group quickly realizes The Cabin isn’t abandoned, quite the contrary. Further investigation uncovers that the inhabitant of this Cabin is dangerous. Terrified your group scrambles for an exit, reaching the door you entered you come face to face with the madman himself. With a severely deformed face from frostbite, the madman weapon in hand demands that you stay. Declaring you have one hour to find something that means the world to him, if unsuccessful you will never leave. The madman exits, sealing the door behind him.",2-10,60,Difficult,Very scary,,0.35
