"Escape room ""Secrets of the Master"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-secrets-of-the-master,"3542 S Maryland Parkway Las Vegas, NV 89169","20 years ago, the art world was on the verge of its next great artist. A boy who was light years ahead of his time. His works were unlike anything seen before. The media dubbed him, “The Master”. As his fame grew, so did the pressure, and one day he just vanished, never to be seen or heard from again.
As time passed, the stories of “The Master” seemed more like legend than real life. Until recently, when valuable pieces of art began going missing from museums across the globe, replaced by perfect replicas. There was no one with this type of precision and excellence in the last 20 years, other than, “The Master”.
