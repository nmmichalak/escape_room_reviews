This strange family moved into this house about 4 months ago. The father and mother come and go from the house, but never speak to anyone. Their teenage boy never leaves the house. Not for school, sports or any other activities.
However, a nosey neighbor notices that for some reason, the parents do leave with the boy on the second Tuesday of each month at 5:00 pm. They then return home exactly one hour later. Your team's mission is to help find out what these people are hiding. Be quick - you really don't want to get caught trespassing in the home of The Neighbors!",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
