"Escape room ""Slaughter"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-slaughter,"6633 Hollywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90028","Welcome to Room 1974. Feeling a bit hungry? There is plenty of meat in the fridge. Unfortunately, it seems our staff has mistakenly booked your luxury villa reservation and instead, given you this room. For the past couple of years, it has been the home of quite an interesting character. 
He is not in presently, but we know he is due back in one hour. We hope you will make it out of here, in time, before he returns. Otherwise, you will simply become the latest addition to his eccentric room décor.
We do hope you’ll join us for dinner. Enjoy your stay!",3-8,60,Very difficult,None,12+,None
