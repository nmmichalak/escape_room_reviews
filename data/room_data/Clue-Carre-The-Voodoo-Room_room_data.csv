"Escape room ""The Carnival Heist"" by Clue Carré in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/Clue-Carre-The-Voodoo-Room,"830 Union Street Suite 101 New Orleans, LA 70112","Carnival season is in full swing, and the Vieux Carré Art Gallery is hosting a masquerade ball to showcase the new jewel of its collection – the King’s Crown, a beautiful (and expensive) work of art. Security may be tight, but the main gallery is off-limits to guests for one hour – giving you just enough time to pose as gallery staff and steal the King’s Crown for yourselves. Can you get into the gallery and back out with the priceless art, or will you be caught red-handed and spend Mardi Gras in the slammer? ",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,14+,0.44
