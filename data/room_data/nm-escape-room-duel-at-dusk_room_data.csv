The duel will take place today at dusk. Unfortunately, you have misplaced your gun and other items.
You must retrace your steps from the prior night’s events and return to the saloon where the bartender has agreed to give you and your posse one hour to retrieve your lost items which include: your pistol, your lucky rabbit’s foot, and your courage. You also are hoping this will trigger you to recall the name of the person you’ll be dueling.
Exit the saloon with these trusted, lucky items and the name of your dueling partner within the hour, and there’s no way you’ll lose. Don’t find them, and you may as well leave town!",4-8,60,Easy,Not scary,,None
