The city long considered demolishing the earlier structure, but in 1938 sold the property to Raleigh architect William Henley Deitrick. Deitrick, who was garnering a regional reputation for modernist design, chose to convert the aging tower into his architectural offices.
William had a great interest in Medieval history, crusades, and historic artifacts, some say he spent most of his life in search of Holy Grail.
