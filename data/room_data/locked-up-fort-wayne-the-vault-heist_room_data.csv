Jefferson Blvd., Fort Wayne, IN 46804","Alice Deville, only surviving daughter of coal-mining-mogul Charles Deville, inherited her family’s fortune soon after her father passed away in the early 1900s. She was greedy with her newfound riches and moved all of her assets to a newly-opened, exclusive banking institution in the United States, and spent the rest of her life hoarding the family fortune until she died in 1952. 
To this day, her riches remain in a deposit box within the vault of Richmond Bank and Trust, surrounded by thick concrete walls, iron bars, maximum security, and only accessible by a select few….. unless you have connections. For years since her death, corrupt Bank and Trust personnel have been trying to cash-in on the the DeVille Fortune and steal it for themselves; however, they know they cannot complete this task alone. Your team has been assembled in the dead of night by one of these tellers in order to extract the riches, undetected. 
As the man on the inside, you must follow their secret knowledge and navigate into the vault, recover her family fortune, and make it out before the cops arrive.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
