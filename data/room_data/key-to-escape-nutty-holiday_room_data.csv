You decided to spend the Holiday with your crazy, holiday obsessed aunt.  While there, a sudden snow storm hit and you are stranded.   You have now been stuck for several days with nothing to do.. even cable is out... and all there is to watch in her place is her collection of Holiday movies.   All you want is to get home in time to celebrate the New Years with your friends.  Your car is going nowhere.  If you don't catch the next train out of this town, you will have no chance of making it to your New Years celebration.  You have located two snow mobiles and now you just need to find the keys.  In the distance you can hear the train.... It will pull out of the station soon.  You have about an hour to find the keys to get there in time.  ",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,8+,None
