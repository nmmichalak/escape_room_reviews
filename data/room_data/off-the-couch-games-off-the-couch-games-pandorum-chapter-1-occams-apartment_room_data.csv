"Escape room ""Pandorum. Chapter 1: Occam's Apartment"" by Off The Couch Games in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/off-the-couch-games-off-the-couch-games-pandorum-chapter-1-occams-apartment,"1220 Memorex Dr #300 Santa Clara, CA 95050","It is the year 2149. The world has changed greatly in the last 100 years as a brilliant scientist named Professor Occam has made cybernetic enhancements commercially available for everyone. Many people began upgrading their bodies to become stronger, smarter, faster, healthier, and virtually indestructible.

Sadly, some citizens of Pandorum began using their new bodies in malicious and criminal ways. Crime increased dramatically as law enforcement had to choose between stopping the crime and risking the surrounding areas when attempting to catch these rogue cyborgs. This has caused a social and political rift between cyborgs and the humans who were beginning to live in constant fear of what they could do.

Professor Occam, reflecting on what is happening and taking responsibility for the chaos that his research has caused, created an academy of elite individuals known as ""EXO"". You are the most recent graduates of the EXO academy and are part of the Hunter division specializing in neutralizing and capturing rogue cyborgs.

Professor Occam has been your mentor and the closest thing you had to a father. It is extremely odd that he was not at your EXO graduation. Your commander X has given you your first mission: Investigate what happened to Professor Occam.
