Two years ago Frank Sinatra and Sam “Cement Boots” Polizzi, an infamous Chicago mobster, bought the Lake Tahoe casino that borders Nevada and California. Ever since, your best friend – Tahoe’s chief homicide detective - has been investigating various crimes that may have ties to the mafia, including blackmail, racketeering, money laundering, cover-ups, torture and murder.
Sometimes, over a drink, he’ll slip with details from the investigation like secret tunnels, severed limbs fished out of the lake or Marilyn Monroe and JFK sightings before her “overdose” as he’d refer to it. Now your best friend is missing and you decide to sneak into his private office to see if you can uncover clues and solve his mysterious disappearance.
But time is limited. You will have to hurry! In 60 minutes ""Cement Boots"" and his associates will stop by to do their own ""research"" and if you are found you might be the next one to swim with the fishes!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
