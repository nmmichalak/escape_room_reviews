Your man on the outside has bought you 60 minutes before the authorities come and close the site down for good â€“ so you have this small window of time to break in, steal the Pharaoh's Golden Idol (if it even exists...) and get out. Be warned: There are rumors of ancient traps and curses that lay within, protecting against tomb raiders. But of course, you don't believe in any of that nonsense...",3-8,60,Average,A little scary,7+,None
