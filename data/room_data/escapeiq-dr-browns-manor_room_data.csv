No one has heard from him since seven days ago. He had been in his manor furiously working on his time machine, shouting in the excitement that he was on the brink of discovering time travel. You need to break into Dr. Brownâ€™s manor and find out what happened! But you must be swift and careful. Dr. Brown rigged his home out of paranoia.
