You and the rest of the staff have broken into the office in the middle of the night to try to come up with a plan to stop him from taking over. However- when you get inside the office, the security guard accidentally locks you in and goes home for the night. It’s up to your team to find the most iconic items from The Office in order to escape and to stop the assistant to the regional manager from meeting with Corporate in New York in the morning.
