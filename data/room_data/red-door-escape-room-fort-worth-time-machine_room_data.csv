You and your friends decide to borrow your uncle’s time machine - none of you meant to disrupt the inter-dimensional galactic timezone continuum but that’s exactly what happened and you’ve got to fix it.  You must have taken a wrong turn somewhere, because now each of your friends is trapped in a different era, and it’s causing a time riffle.  The time machine’s battery is draining fast and you need to get back to your original date before you’re all permanently trapped in different times!",4-7,60,Very difficult,Not scary,14+,None
