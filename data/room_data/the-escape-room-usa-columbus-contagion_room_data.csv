"Escape room ""Contagion"" by The Escape Room USA - Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/the-escape-room-usa-columbus-contagion,"459 North High Street Ste. 2 Columbus, OH 43215","In the 1980’s a local Top Secret NSA biological weapons lab was shuddered. Most of its staff met a violent end at the hands of their infected co-workers. The lab was “decontaminated” when closed, but unfortunately, a small fireproof refrigerator was overlooked and it was recently opened with devastating results for the infected and three of his neighbors.
As a leading national expert on biological pathogens, your team has been quickly assembled in hopes of avoiding a national Outbreak. On arriving at the lab, half of your team was immediately accosted by another infected victim who had been hiding in the lab. The disease has been found fatal in 78% of the infected (and 43% of their neighbors). The historic research on the disease indicates its effects may be reversible within a short window of being infected. It was even rumored that a cure for this disease was in the lab, but it was never found. Can you find the cure for you and your team before the disease and its effects are permanent?",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,10+,0.2
