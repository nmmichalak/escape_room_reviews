"Escape room ""End Run"" by Escape Rooms HQ in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-rooms-hq-end-run,"1701 W Walnut Hill Ln Irving, TX 75038","Your team of freelance journalists has been hired to infiltrate the Dallas offices of the multinational energy conglomerate ENDRUN. Your team wouldn’t usually take a job like this but the chance to expose one of the most corrupt companies in our nation for their misdeeds is just too enticing.
Your employer needs you to find the data needed to prove that ENDRUN is dirty and has arranged for the entire staff to be out of the office for a “team building” event at a local escape room. You will have 60 minutes, your wits, and hopefully some luck to infiltrate the office and get what you need.",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,13+,0.2
