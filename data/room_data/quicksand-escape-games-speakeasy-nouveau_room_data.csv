"Escape room ""Speakeasy Nouveau"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-speakeasy-nouveau,"1001 Garnet Ave, San Diego, CA 92109","It's the height of Prohibition and speakeasies are all the rage. You don't recall much about the other night, but you do remember putting up your prized Babe Ruth signed baseball as collateral for your tab. When you attempted to settle up, they said they'll just keep the ball instead. Today, you've vowed to get it back. You don't know where that speakeasy is, but you know entered through a barbershop. Now find your way in, get your baseball back, and get out before the mob guys return and give you a slugging worse than that of the Babe himself. ",3-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
