"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Escape the Falls in Great Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/great-falls/quests/escape-the-falls-the-asylum,"511 Central Ave Great Falls, MT 59401","You just realized that you were drugged and a few of your ‘test’ subjects have escaped the asylum holding room, and they have locked you and your staff in the room. You have no idea where the group went. After weeks of fighting them for using them as testers, you have a good guess they have found the virus ‘Nightmare’ you were working on.
The virus destroys human civilization by turning everyone into a mutated zombie, and they hid it in the asylum someplace before they escaped. You have 60 minutes to find where they placed the ‘Nightmare’ and disperse it.",4-8,60,Average,A little scary,9+,None
