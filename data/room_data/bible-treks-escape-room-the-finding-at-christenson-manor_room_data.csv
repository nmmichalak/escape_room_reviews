Alameda Ave. Aurora, CO 80012","The Seminary at Oxford University recently received a strange letter from a family known as the Christenson's in the north of England requesting your help in exploring an old study that was just recently discovered at their manor home!
The family patriarch whom the study belonged to, Dr. Nigel Christenson, had it sealed up following his passing. Therefore, the room has been left untouched since the 1880's... Word is that Dr. Christenson was a devoted follower of Christ, and had a passion to pass that on. So my friends, be very observant as you enter the room. Dr. Christenson has left quite a journey in store for you upon entering his study!",2-8,90,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
