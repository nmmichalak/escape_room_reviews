"Escape room ""The Classroom Conundrum"" by Central Escapes in Mt Pleasant",https://worldofescapes.com/mt-pleasant/quests/central-escapes-christmas-chaos,"806 S Mission St, Mt Pleasant, MI 48858","The Quiz Bowl Capers are the school superstars; they’ve won the championship five years running and their trophies line the halls! However, the stresses of stardom seem to have addled their leader, Maxwell Cage. In an effort to prepare his team for this year’s championship, Cage has adopted some unorthodox training methods. Now, it seems your classroom is his new testing ground.

Having forgotten your bag, you ran back into your class at the end of the day with some of your colleagues, only to find the door locked behind you and a series of challenges rigged all about you. Unfortunately, Cage forgot one important thing: the school goes into lockdown over break tonight. You only have one hour before you are trapped for 10 days without food, cell reception, or heating. You will have no choice but to solve the puzzles the devious Cage has devised or freeze in this building with no chance of escape.

Remember: not everything about this classroom is as it appears. Will you have what it takes to outwit the Capers where so many others have failed?”",2-6,60,Very difficult,Not scary,17+,0.25
