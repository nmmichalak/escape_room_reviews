East Street Frederick, MD 21701","Almost 100 years ago, the ghost of an evil witch was tormenting the citizens of Frederick. After many frustrated attempts to content the ghost, three Witches that practice white magic got together and cast a powerful spell to trap the ghost in an enchanted box.
Recently some teenagers broke into her historically preserved home and accidentally let the ghost out. This is why we need your help, your team of Ghost Hunters is our only hope. You need to enter her home and re-capture the Ghost before midnight or the enchanted spell will be broken forever.",2-6,60,Very difficult,A little scary,,0.25
