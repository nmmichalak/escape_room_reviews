A Grand Rapids, MI 49546","It was the perfect weekend getaway. You and a handful of friends rented a cabin in the woods and enjoyed a day of hiking and exploring the lake. After a fitful night of sleep, you are awakened by the voice of your friend. His panicked strains process before his words.
You open your eyes but there is nothing but darkness. As your eyes adjust, you see that the rest of the room is dark and separated by prison bars in which you are caged.
Suddenly, a screechy high pitched voice shatters the silence… “Welcome to your judgment! Thank you for coming.” You have awakened in a jail cell owned by a crazed judge. He knows all about your past and has decided to take the law into his own hands. In his twisted sense of mercy, he is giving you 60 minutes to prove your worth or face his sentence.",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,12+,0.54
