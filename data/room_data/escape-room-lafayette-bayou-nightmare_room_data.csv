Kicking and screaming, you canâ€™t stop him from dragging you into a nearby dark, dingy, run-down cabin that feels as old as the swamp itself.
There is a faint but distinct smell of death lingering in the air. Now that he has you securely imprisoned, your captor leaves, but unfortunately will return in an hour. Can you find a way to escape this horror before he gets back?",2-6,60,Average,A little scary,,None
