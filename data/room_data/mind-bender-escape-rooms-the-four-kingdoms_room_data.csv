The Great Night will usher in a terrifying new era when the dead will rise, destroying everything, and everyone, in the land. According to prophecy, the only way to survive the Great Night is to combine the powers of The Four Kingdoms.
Each kingdom holds a unique and powerful relic. Legend has it that the artifacts, which have long been lost, are hidden somewhere in the Ancient Sanctuary. Only the one true king can unite these artifacts of power and avert the imminent disaster. Only by successfully completing a series of quests before time runs out will they be revealed.
But, heed this warning: time is slipping away and there is only one hour left before darkness falls and The Great Night begins.
Survival of The Four Kingdoms depends on you! Will you and your team be able to navigate the quests, find the four relics and unite the realms before it’s too late? The fate of humanity rests in your hands!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
