"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,"1502 N Semoran Blvd Suite 160 Orlando, FL 32807","Dr. Lycan is a scientist that has dedicated twenty years of his life to research a powerful formula that he believes can mutate human DNA, forming a half-wolf, half-man hybrid. After perfecting the formula, Dr. Lycan needed test subjects, so he released the formula in the middle of New York City.
The formula was more powerful than he expected and assimilated into an airborne virus. The CDC unit has issued a total shutdown of New York to contain the people now turning into werewolves. Dr. Lycan has gone missing, and with further investigation, we know there is an antidote in his office.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate his office, look for evidence of Doctor Lycan's whereabouts and find the antidote. Upon breaking the seal and entering the office, you will be exposed to the virus which will cause a complete mutation within an hour. You are willingly exposing yourself to find the cure. Are you ready to accept your mission?",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,0.34
