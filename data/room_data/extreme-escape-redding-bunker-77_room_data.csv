"Escape room ""Bunker 77"" by Extreme Escape Redding in Redding",https://worldofescapes.com/redding/quests/extreme-escape-redding-bunker-77,"1440 Butte St. Redding, CA 96001",You have been contracted by the US government to complete a mission. Troop 77 has been called out of the area on an emergency recon mission. The bunker is running off of a generator because the terrorist have been successful at disabling the main power supply. They are trying to breach the bunker to find a red file containing nuclear launch codes. The generator only has enough gas to run the bunker for an hour. If the power goes out on the bunker the terrorists will assume the bunker is unmanned and unprotected. They will then advance their people to breach the bunker and find the file to launch a worldwide nuclear attack. There is a backup electrical system still in tact that only requires two fuses within the bunker to be installed and that alone will restore power to the bunker.  ,2-6,60,Average,Not scary,7+,None
