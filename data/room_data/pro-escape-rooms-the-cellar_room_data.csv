"Escape room ""The Outbreak"" by Pro-Escape Rooms in Victoria",https://worldofescapes.com/victoria/quests/pro-escape-rooms-the-cellar,"3205 Old Goliad Rd Victoria, TX 77905","10 Months ago, a deadly virus mutated in a FOH lab. We are all hoping it was by accident. The first persons to get infected were the scientist working on the virus. The virus causes the loss of motor skills, loss of reason and ravenous hunger! All the scientists in the facility infected each other. In only a day the WHOLE lab was lost and only in a month the whole city of Victoria. Today about 85% of the population is infected. “We all call them ZOMBIES” Our best hope of survival was a team of American scientist working hard on a cure for the virus for the past couple of months. Night and day, they were so close to discovering a cure to eradicate this horrible virus. 16 hours ago, we lost contact with American lab. We fear the worst. We need to send your research team to find out what happened and try to finish the cure. Your team is the only hope left for humanity!!!",2-6,60,Average,A little scary,,None
