The guests are contracting the disease while on vacation in the area. The panic that has ensued has led to a reward being offered for the person or persons that can find the antidote to the fever which could save lives, including yours.
One of the guests was found in a nearby cabin and brought to the lab so the remains could be inspected. Your team has been assembled to assist in finding and mixing the antidote. With the concern of possible contamination, the lab has been left as the assistant described and warnings issued that possible leaks may occur if anyone searches indiscriminately in the lab.
So beware, if you or any of your team is contaminated you have less than an hour to find the antidote. Move about with caution. The lives of everyone are at risk.",2-10,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
