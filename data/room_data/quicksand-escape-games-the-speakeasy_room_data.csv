"Escape room ""Speakeasy"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-the-speakeasy,"1001 Garnet Ave, San Diego, CA 92109","It's the roaring twenties, the time when Prohibition is at large and most people would trade all of that ""progress"" for a beer. The only place to get a drink is at a mob-run Speakeasy. When you go for a taste of the forbidden sauce, things get a bit rowdy and the bartender locks you in so the boss can sort out the mess. You overhear that the boss will be back in an hour. While the night may have started out as the ""bee's knees"", it will be your knees if you can't escape!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,12+,None
