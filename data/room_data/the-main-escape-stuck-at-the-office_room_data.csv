You are all told there is a tornado expected to touch down in your location within the hour. As you are gathering your belongings, you feel a large tremor throughout the office.
You notice, the generator did not come on and the automatic locking doors will only open with keys that your boss has stashed away somewhere in the office. You will need to find a way to locate the keys, and escape. If you do not find your way out in 60 minutes you will find yourselves in the middle of a tornado.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
