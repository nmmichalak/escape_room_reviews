"Escape room ""Villain's Lair"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-villains-lair,"​​314 Stratford Square, Bloomingdale, IL 60108","Supervillains have been spotted at the mall. They are believed to be members of C.U.T.E. (Criminals Uniting to Terrorize Everyone).  We have intercepted a recruitment packet and your mission is to infiltrate their headquarters believed to be located at 314 Stratford Square Mall.
You have 45 minutes to gather the intel from all over the mall and gain access to their lair… Hopefully, you will be able to obtain a code to enter into the security system to open the door. Once inside you will have to stop the missile launch and the nuclear device that are both going off in 10 minutes.",1-6,45,Average,Not scary,6+,0.5
