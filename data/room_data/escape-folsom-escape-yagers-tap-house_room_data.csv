After doing some research about unfound treasure in Northern California, you came across a story of Peter Yager hiding his fortune within his old bar, Yager’s Tap House.

The bar has been closed since the late 1980’s. Since the time of Mr. Yager’s death, no one has been able to account for his fortune. There is a rumor that he didn’t spend much of his wealth and was a good business man.

You travel to the historic town of Folsom, find the old, abandoned bar and sneak inside to hunt for the fortune that may have been left behind.

By opening the back door, you have triggered a silent alarm. Don’t worry – the closest police station is sixty minutes away giving you ample time to locate the fortune.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,14+,None
