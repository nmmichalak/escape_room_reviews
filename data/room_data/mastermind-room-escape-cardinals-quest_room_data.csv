"Escape room ""Cardinals Quest"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-cardinals-quest,"440 N 4th St #290 St. Louis, MO 63102","It’s the 7 inning stretch in a tied game of Cards versus Cubs, and the lights in Busch Stadium have just gone dark. You are such huge fans that you can't allow the game to end just like that - the show must go on!
You have to make sure the game is finished in St. Louis because (as any true baseball fan knows), according to MLB rules, if a TIED game is suspended between innings, the game must be replayed on the opposing team’s home field. Your mission is to find a way to get the lights back on. Don’t strike out, or we’ll have to replay the game in Chicago.",2-12,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,0.34
