Pet Snatched is an escape room for all you dog lovers out there who want to combine your appreciation for pooches with a thrilling mystery to solve.

The theme of this escape room goes a little something like this: The town’s pets have been disappearing, and you suspect the seemingly sweet old lady down the street is really the head of a vicious underground pet-snatching ring. You’ve tried to warn your neighbors and notify the police about your suspicions, but who would believe that Granny Sticky Fingers could be responsible for such a heinous crime?

But it just got personal. Yesterday, your own beloved Fluffy disappeared out of your backyard. You just know that Granny Sticky Fingers is the one who nabbed her. You’ve got to get your precious Fluffy back before she’s sold on the pet black market, but this won’t be a simple rescue.

Granny Sticky Fingers is a cunning old broad. She’s cleverly hidden Fluffy behind a series of locks and puzzles that only Granny and her goons know how to solve. Thankfully, Granny’s at her weekly Bridge club meeting, playing cards with the neighborhood biddies. You and your friends only have one hour to break into Granny Sticky Finger’s home, rescue Fluffy and escape out the back door before she returns.

Can you bring your little pup home, or is she doomed to an unknown fate? The outcome is in your hands at Exit Strategy Games.",1-12,60,Average,Not scary,14+,None
