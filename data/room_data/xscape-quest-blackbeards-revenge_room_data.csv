Authorities have searched the ship but have been scared away by threats of the Cursed Treasure.
Rumors persist that there is undiscovered treasure still aboard but no one that has searched for it has lived to tell the tale. All men who touch the treasure spend their afterlife in Davy Jones’s Locker. We have heard a tale of a way to break the Curse.
