Certain fundamental concepts are introduced indirectly in a colorful living-cartoon game with a need for just enough parental guidance to make the shared experience special.  

Your participation as an adult is required as some of the items may be difficult for young children to grasp without a little help.

Please guide them along and work to help them stay focused on the tasks at hand as best you canâ€¦

Ages 10-12

The concepts introduced in the puzzle at this level are a step more difficult and a little more independence is generally preferred.  Some adult help is still required, but for the most part as young minds are challenged the opportunity to see them fully engaged grows greater while the clock forces a higher level of engagement and focus so these opportunities are somewhat super-charged.

Adults

A minimum of 1 adult must participate to help keep the kids engaged and to help them move forward in the puzzle.

Mixed Ages

It is possible to make a mixed ages combined puzzle as well.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,6+,None
