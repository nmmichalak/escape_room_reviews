"Escape room ""Saloon"" by EXIT Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/exit-tallahassee-saloon,"1212 North Monroe Tallahassee, FL 32303","It all started back with prospector Billy Brown and his brother, Jim. Boys found the biggest gold nugget that’s even been found. Story is that lots of people were robbed and killed by folks trying to get it away from them, so the boys set off for home with the nugget in tow.
But one night, Ol’ Jim drank more than his share of whiskey and told the boys at the poker table a little too much. Quicker than a lick, the story spread and those two Brown boys had to run for their lives! The last place either Billy or Jim was seen was in Cactus Jack’s Saloon, and we’re betting that nugget might still be hidden there!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
