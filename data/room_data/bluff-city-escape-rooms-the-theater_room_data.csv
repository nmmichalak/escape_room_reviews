"Escape room ""Theater"" by Bluff City Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/bluff-city-escape-rooms-the-theater,"6759 Stage Rd. Bartlett, TN 38134","Strange things have been happening in the theater. Strange enough that tonight, opening night, some of the actors are too scared to take the stage. The ones that aren't just freaked out are whispering about quitting because they are sick of lights going down early, props coming up missing, and unusual doors being locked.
Which brings us to you guys. You and your team of paranormal investigators are here to prove that there's no haunting here. Maybe it's faulty wiring, or even a mischievous patron just trying to stir up some trouble. Either way, you'd better work fast. Showtime is in 45 minutes and if our stars won't go on, we will have to shut the doors, forever!",1-10,45,Difficult,Not scary,,0.43
