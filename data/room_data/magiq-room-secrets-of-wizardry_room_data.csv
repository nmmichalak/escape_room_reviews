A wicked elf hid your wands and cursed you. Don’t forget that a wizard – to keep his power – needs his wand, a sword, a ring, tabooed things, books, a crystal globe, magic potions, amulets, magic rolls, and last but not least some kind of animal companion, usually a snake or a rat. You have an hour to break the curse with the hidden wands and then leave the building.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,6+,None
