Limestone Street, Gaffney, SC 29340","Something's wrong. The agency hasn't heard from Sherlock in over a week. While he's known to disappear for a day here and there, he always checks in. I know you haven't had much detective training, but can you and your team go to Sherlock's apartment, figure out which case he was working on & bring him home? You have 60 minutes to solve the mystery at 221B Baker Street, or else I fear we may not get him back at all!",4-6,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
