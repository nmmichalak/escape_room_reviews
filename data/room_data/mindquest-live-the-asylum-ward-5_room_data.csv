"Escape room ""The Asylum: Ward 5"" by MindQuest Escape Games in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/mindquest-live-the-asylum-ward-5,"9938 Universal Blvd #112, Orlando, FL 32819","1941 – secret government experiments are being performed on mental health patients in the Asylum. Patients who tried to escape have never been seen or heard from again, but rumors of the torturous activity are spreading, making the Asylum one of the most feared locations in town. Authorities are of no use and are perhaps in on it. Patients are suffering and disappearing.

Nurse Betty, a very special operating assistant, was secretly contacted by a group of concerned citizens and family who have lost their loved ones to this Asylum. Betty has begun to hide information in the Asylum, specifically in Ward 5, the high-security wing.

You must help the patients and Nurse Betty. You and your team have been sent in to find the secret facility and get the proof needed to stop these activities from continuing. Be careful – if they find you in the Asylum, you may not survive the night, and might even become subjects of the crazy experiments! Hurry, please! There are lives at stake and no time to waste!",2-4,20,Average,Not scary,7+,None
