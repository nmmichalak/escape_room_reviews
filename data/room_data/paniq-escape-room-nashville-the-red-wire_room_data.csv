"Escape room ""The Red Wire"" by Paniq Escape Room Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/paniq-escape-room-nashville-the-red-wire,"1113 Murfreesboro Rd #256, Franklin, TN 37064","The intelligence world is cloaked in secret, but one of those secrets has slipped out. The Fixer, a shadowy foreign agent, has been identified in the United States, presumably gathering intelligence for an attack on your home soil. Your analysts have tracked him to an old neighborhood where you believe he has established a safehouse.
You and your fellow agents have been assigned to find him and discover his plans. Looking at the makeup of your squad, you all realize something about the Fixer at the same time; he’s no stranger to explosives. In fact, it might as well be his calling card, because each member of your team is specially trained in bomb defusal.
You need to act fast if you’re going to find the safehouse, discover what he has been up to, and get that information back to the Agency before he is in the wind once again.",2-7,60,Difficult,Not scary,12+,None
