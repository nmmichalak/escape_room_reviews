Their race is under attack from a superior race, and they have been tasked with finding help by any means possible. They have devised a test for you, slowly removing all of your senses to determine if you are indeed the chosen ones to set them free.
 Time is short, and you need to find the antidote to regain your senses; fail, and you may never be the same again.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
