Today’s tour: The History of Time Travel, which starts…in the 1960s? In the past few years (of the sixties, that is), INSPiRE Laboratories has been rising in the public eye and offers many innovations for your home and family, but there may be more behind its cheerful façade.
  
When you arrive on location, your tour guide is nowhere to be found, but when the offices of IINSPiRE LABS lie just down the hall, curiosity gets the best of you, but with nobody tending to your device, it leaves without you! You will need to seek out a new way to return to your own time in one or be stuck in the 60s forever.
  
Can you make it back to modern times? You’ll be successful either way, if you want to wait 50-60 years.",2-7,60,Very difficult,Not scary,,None
