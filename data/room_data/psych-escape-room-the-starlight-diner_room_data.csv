You’re winding down the day by stopping at the Starlight Diner before heading home exhausted. 

The meal was great, but there’s just one problem. The bill comes and you can’t find your wallet. You know you had it when you arrived, but where is it? 

You explain to the manager that you can’t find your wallet. He gives you 60 minutes to find it and pay your bill or else you’ll be washing dishes in the kitchen all night long to work off your meal. 

Will you find your wallet before the 60 minutes is up or will you have to face a sink full of dishes?",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
