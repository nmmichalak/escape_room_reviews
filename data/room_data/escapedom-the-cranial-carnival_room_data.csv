"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,"1373 Westwood Blvd 2nd FL, Los Angeles CA 90024","It was a dreary day at the carnival when Anatoly Smith was found in a coma after getting lost in the Hall of Mirrors. This poor boy was so petrified by his day at the carnival, the fear got the better of him. Luckily, Anatoly’s father is a brilliant, albeit experimental, scientist and has been working hard on a new invasive treatment to wake his son up.
This is where you come in! With the help of your team (and some funding from social media), you will enter into the representation of Anatoly’s mind. Once inside you will need to venture deeper and deeper to locate his scary memories from the carnival and lock them away for good!
Daring geniuses beware! If you do not complete the treatment in 60 minutes, Anatoly’s mind will become aware of your presence and send antibodies to eliminate you!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
