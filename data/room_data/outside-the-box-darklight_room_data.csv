"Escape room ""Darklight"" by Outside the Box in Webster",https://worldofescapes.com/webster/quests/outside-the-box-darklight,"251 Main St. Rear, Webster, MA 01570","Take on your friends in a head-to-head puzzle battle against the clock.  Two teams. Two identical rooms with identical puzzles. Most points after 60 minutes wins.

But that's not it...

Each puzzle has a unique piece that only ONE team can get. SO... sabotage is encouraged! Take their pieces, take their points, or plunge them into utter darkness.  (or make them dress up in a costume and dance like their life depends on itâ€¦ever seen grandpa twerk? We have!).

Hopefully they won't hate you for too long...",2-12,60,Average,Not scary,,None
