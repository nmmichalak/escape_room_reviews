It seems crazy to break INTO school but that’s exactly what he must do.  A substitute teacher confiscated his cell phone before the long weekend. The school is locked.  The classroom is locked.  The teacher is gone. And Derek’s cell phone is securely trapped inside Eisenhower Elementary School.  Help Derek survive the weekend and get his cell phone back! ",1-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,0.61
