She’s fixin’ to hold a hootenanny tonight to celebrate the launch of her new brew, so there ain’t much tickin’ and a tockin’ left on the old time wheel for Paw to stop ‘er before it’s too late.

Even a blind toad that ain’t got but just three legs can see that’s where you come in. No one would ever suspect them fancy city folk is really Paw’s seventh cousins five times removed. It’s time to defend that family honor which’n no one quite understands and put Maw outta’ business fer good. Ya best be hurryin’ cause Maw will be back soon. Paw’s kin’ll give you the tools you’re gonna need to do the job. So what are y’all waitin’ for? Stop listenin’ to me and break into Maw’s shack and blow her ‘shine still to smithereens!
