The USS Falcon, a galactic transport, has been attacked. Blindsided as they were by this attack they stood no chance of winning. Rather than let themselves and the shipâ€™s cargo be taken by the enemy they sabotaged systems and abandoned ship after setting the self destruct countdown. Enter your team. You pushed back the enemy but now you must fix the systems and deactivate the self destruct before the Falcon and all its cargo is lost.
