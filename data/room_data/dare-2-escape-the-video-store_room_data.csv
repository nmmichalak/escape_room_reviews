Eccentric businessman and Harvest Moon Video store owner,  Joseph Boddy , is set to retire. He has decided to randomly select several membership cards from his Video Store database and has issued special “golden tickets” to a lucky few. A local newspaper, The Sleepy Hollow Patch, is reporting that Mr. Boddy has laid out a series of challenges throughout his beloved video store for the chosen few, and if successful, the team will be rewarded THE DEED to the store. 

Mr. Boddy feels it is time for a change in ownership, one that can bring a fresh new upgrade to Harvest Moon Video as a new generation takes the helm of the film world. HMV has always been a prominent fixture on Main Street in the quiet village of Sleepy Hollow, New York. This quaint store continues to be the hot spot in town on a Friday night, as locals fill the aisles look for movies to rent.

At exactly 10:31 pm, a video beings to play inside the store. Your instructions are simple. You must gain entrance to the store and complete the tasks within an hour. If you are successful, you will be granted the deed to Harvest Moon Video. However, if you cannot complete his game in time, your car will be towed, and the next team of lucky golden ticket winners will get their change at this one-in=a=lifetime opportunity.
