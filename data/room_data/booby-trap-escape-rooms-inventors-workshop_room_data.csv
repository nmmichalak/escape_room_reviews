"Escape room ""Inventor's Workshop"" by Booby Trap Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/booby-trap-escape-rooms-inventors-workshop,"100 N Gasser Rd Suite B Baraboo, WI 53913","Good afternoon. I am Reginald Clearwater, an airship pilot who travels the world gathering items for an inventor named Richard Worthington. I regret to inform you that Worthington passed away last night. He was an inventor who dedicated his life to helping the people in his little corner of London. When his wife died 2 years ago, everything changed and he became distant and paranoid. 

During this period of mental isolation, one thing remained constant: his respect for you. He believed you were the brightest team of detectives. In fact, he thought each of you were equal to his own intellect. 

Near the end, he became consumed by the fear of dying. He didn’t want his years of work and creations to fall into the wrongs hands. He thought all of you were very capable of continuing his own work. But in order to do so, you must find his will before the bank arrives to seize control. 

They are on the way, so your time is limited. You must work together to solve his puzzles to find his will. Worthington was curious man with a wild imagination, so you’ll find many peculiar items in his home. 

We don’t have any more time for waiting. Please, don’t let his amazing inventions get in the wrong hands.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
