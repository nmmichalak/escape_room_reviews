"Escape room ""The Estate"" by Enigma Escapes WA in Tacoma",https://worldofescapes.com/tacoma/quests/enigma-escapes-wa-the-estate,"101 S 10th Street Tacoma, WA 98402","Grandma recently passed away and left a substantial inheritance, but your cousin claims it is all his. He produced a Last Will and Testament, but something doesn't seem quite right about it. You are sure, it is a forgery, but you have no evidence.
Your cousin plans to demolish the house (burying anything inside) and build a strip mall. You and your team have one hour to find grandma's real Last Will and Testament and get out of the house before the wrecking crew buries you and everything else under thousands of pounds of rubble.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
