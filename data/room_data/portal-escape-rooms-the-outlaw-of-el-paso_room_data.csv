Coincidentally, the local saloon owner disappeared around the same time. Moreover, a nearby bank vault was recently robbed! I believe there’s a connection between these events. Sheriff Dubell is out of town, so it’s up to you to track down the two men and the missing gold. The law is in your hands now, partner, saddle up and deliver some wild west justice! Good luck, Deputy Jones.",3-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
