From your command center, you direct the colonization of planet Dreon. When a routine transport carrying a shipment of Cellenium disappears – you fear a rival colony has stolen this valuable resource for themselves. Before you can recover your shipment, an ancient evil from space known only as Vulad launches an attack intending to destroy both human colonies and seize the Cellenium for himself.

Without that Cellenium, your colony will not be able to power its weapons or defense systems. It’s up to you to take command of a ship and rescue the transport before either the other colony or Vulad get to it first. Humanity’s future in space is at stake. Will you answer the call and rescue the planet?

Intrigue and subterfuge are necessary if you want to save your colony from the ultimate evil. Featuring interactive lighting, futuristic sound effects.
