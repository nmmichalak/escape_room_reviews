"Escape room ""The Magician's Vanishing Act"" by Escape Key in Roanoke",https://worldofescapes.com/roanoke/quests/escape-key-salem-the-magicians-vanishing-act,"1334 W Main St, Salem, VA 24153","Thanks for coming to help. We know that the old magic shop blew out the power grid, but we have no idea what happened. We'd ask the owner, but he seems to have disappeared, so we've had to keep the shop dark until someone can go in and figure out what happened.

â€‹We'll turn the power back on for 1 hour, which should give you plenty of time to investigate. We need you to figure out where the overload is coming from and keep it from happening again.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,12+,None
