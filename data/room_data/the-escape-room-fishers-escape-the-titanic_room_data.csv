Isidor is, of course, the co-founder of Macy’s department store. You are in the fourth day of your voyage aboard the RMS Titanic. The ship has encountered a significant problem and Isador has pulled you aside stating it is his belief that the Titanic will sink.
He has told you that as a gentleman he will not leave the ship, but he says this creates a problem for Macy’s. Specifically, he has told you that he has a cache of jewels he is taking to the department store and if they do not arrive in New York it will cause the department store significant financial stress. He is joining Ida on deck but he wants you to go to his First Class compartment and retrieve the jewels from the hidden strong room attached to his stateroom.
He then wants you to save yourself and return the jewels to Macy’s in New York. The ship is already starting to list! Can you get the jewels, get back out of the room, and to a life boat in 60 minutes?
