You’ve been wrongfully accused of a crime, and sentenced to life in
prison without the possibility of parole. Your new “home” is a cell that once belonged to 
an inmate who disappeared without a trace…or did he? Some claim he escaped. Others 
swear he was murdered by the infamously cruel warden. But no one actually knows… 
can you escape before you suffer the same fate?
