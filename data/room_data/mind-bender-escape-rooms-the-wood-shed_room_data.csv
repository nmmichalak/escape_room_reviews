They say that dogs won’t go near the site and nothing grows in this area. Up for an exhilarating adventure, you and your group head into the infamous woods for a short hike. Several hours into your adventure, you and your fellow hikers have gotten lost. With nightfall coming soon, there isn’t much time before your situation becomes dire.
Frantically searching for help, food, and shelter, you come upon an ominous looking wood shed. Following the clues left behind by a previous group, you break into the shed and hole up for the night. Once inside, however, you discover that you are in the home of the notorious serial killer Zachary Klein!
This is the worst possible place you could have stumbled upon! But, now you are trapped and he could return at any moment. Will you be able to find your way out in time – or will you become Zachary’s next victims?! You must work quickly and quietly to get out before he returns.",2-10,60,Difficult,A little scary,,None
