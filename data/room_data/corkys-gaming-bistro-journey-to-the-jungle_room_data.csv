While you were cleaning your attic, you found an old board game. Once you begin playing it, you find yourself engulfed by a vortex and transported into an alternate realm. After only seeing a glimpse of the terrible world inside, you are thrown back into reality. You vow to never approach the game again…however you find that the doors are locked and you are trapped. You glance back at the game and see the words “The dice have been rolled”. You have no choice but to complete the game or be trapped inside the other realm forever.
