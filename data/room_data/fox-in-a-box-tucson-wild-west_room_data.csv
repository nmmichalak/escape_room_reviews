"Escape room ""Wild West"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-wild-west,"972 E University Blvd Tucson, AZ 85719","Welcome, partner! Not all is right in the town of Tombstone. It seems that Sheriff Fox has been helping the outlaws instead of enforcing the law. He has been charging ""protection money"" to the businesses and threatens those who do not pay. The saloon owner stopped giving Sheriff Fox his cut of the money. To make an example of the saloon owner, Sheriff Fox has hidden dynamite in the town saloon. Sheriff Fox is threatening to blow up the building, along with half the town! You and your fellow US Marshals have been called to Tombstone, Arizona by the deputy of Sheriff Fox to save it. Will the dynamite win... or you? ",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
