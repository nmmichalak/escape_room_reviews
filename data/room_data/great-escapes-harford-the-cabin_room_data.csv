"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Great Escapes Harford in Bel Air",https://worldofescapes.com/bel-air/quests/great-escapes-harford-the-cabin,"2108 Emmorton Road Bel Air, MD 21015","When the zombie apocalypse first happened, Bambi Barnett was sympathetic to the infected population. After all, they had once been her co-workers, neighbors and friends so she thought there was a chance they could all just get along.

But then it happened…THE ZOMBIES ATE HER DOG!

Now Bambi knows how vicious the undead can be and she needs YOUR help to prevent more pets (and people!) from becoming victims. Together with other apocalypse survivors, you must break in to a remote cabin in the woods where this bloodthirsty pack of flesh-eaters hides out. Their leader is alone in the crumbling structure, so now is your opportunity to get inside and find out what makes him tick so you can take control of his followers.

Your group will enter the lodge from two different doors to surround your target. You must find your way to each other in the darkness and figure out how to take away the zombie’s power.

You have 60 minutes to do it before the mob returns, so stay alert, beware of traps, and remember…zombies take no prisoners. Good luck!",2-8,60,Average,A little scary,,None
