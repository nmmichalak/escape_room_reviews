Realizing she might be on the brink of uncovering a new species, she contacted your team of elite paleontologists to come and assist.
However, as you and your team arrive at the site, you learn that the doctor left, seeking refuge from a sandstorm and accidentally exposing her coordinates to a competitive team of archaeologists. Satellite images of the area show that Dr. Tillman’s team is only an hour away from the dig site.
