"Escape room ""Ghost Collector"" by Escape Virtuality in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-virtuality-ghost-collector,"130 W 29th St New York, NY 10001","The history of New York is filled with mystery, murder and disasters. One person known only as the Ghost Collector, made it his mission to stop the ghosts that terrorized the streets of NY. He devised a way to capture and contain malevolent spirits by locating specific personal objects they were connected to.

Now you and your friends can come to the Ghost Collectors s√©ance room and see for yourself the ghosts that have been collected. However, the only way to view them is to temporarily release them from their containment chamber and then you will have less than 60 minutes to locate their personal items again and perform the correct ritual to return them to containment before they are released permanently to terrorize the people of NY once again.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
