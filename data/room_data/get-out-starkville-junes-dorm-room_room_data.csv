Starkville, MS 39759","Your best friend, June, has just left you a voicemail saying that she needs to turn in her big English paper by 5 o'clock to pass the class.  She has to be at her 4 o'clock class in 5 minutes for a big final and she has left her English paper somewhere hidden away in her dorm room, locked up and protected from any outsiders.  She didn't have enough time to explain to you how to get to the paper or where it is so you need to find the clues and codes that lead to her paper.  You must retrieve the paper within 60 minutes and get it to her english teacher before she fails the class.  You are her only hope.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,13+,None
