"Escape room ""Ice Cream Truck"" by Escape 101 in Danbury",https://worldofescapes.com/danbury/quests/escape-101-ice-cream-truck,"69 Kenosia Avenue, Danbury, CT 06810","Ahh, Summer. For many, these hot and sunny months can be traced back to days spent having fun at the local park.

But what’s a day of Summer fun without a cold treat? 

In the newest room, you are enjoying a sunny afternoon at a community park where an ice cream truck is awaiting customers- though sadly you haven’t a cent in your pocket. No worries! By helping fellow parkgoers through a series of good deeds, you’ll work your way towards earning sweet treats for everyone on your team! But you must act fast, the truck will only be parked for one hour!

There’s a grill to light, recycling to sort, a bike to take for a spin, and you’ll even meet a few furry friends at the dog park! Finally, we included a rock wall for added fun.
