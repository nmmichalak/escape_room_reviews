On day three of your trip, the unthinkable happens. A group of hijackers boarded the ship at your last port of call. After managing to take over the control room, the hijackers have set the ship on a course to run the ship into a great barrier island and sink it.
Upon completing the mission, the hijackers were able to bar the control room from entry and flee in a getaway boat. The ship’s course must be altered within one hour!
