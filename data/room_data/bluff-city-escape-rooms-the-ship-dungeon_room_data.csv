Yesterday a Quarter Master, today a prisoner! How did this happen?
I'll tell you how. That first mate that has been eyeing your position since you set sail has framed you, thatâ€™s how.


Luckily you still have a team of allies on the ship that know you are not trying to stage a mutiny as the Captain has been led to believe. Use them and your own wits to escape the ship's dungeon and prove your innocence before the Captain makes you walk the plank!
