All of the evidence points back to a house just down the street from the lab. But you’ve been there and searched the house from top to bottom and haven’t been able to find anything to help identify the killer.
You enter the house when suddenly you hear the noise of the front door shutting and locking behind you catches your attention. A nervous feeling begins to rise in the pit of your stomach as you realize that if you don’t get out soon, the next victim…will be you.",2-10,60,Very difficult,Scary,,None
