"Escape room ""Protocol Zero"" by Escape Artists in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-artists-protocol-zero,"115 N Oak Avenue Sanford, FL 32771","While exploring deep into the forest, you and your mate stumbled upon what seems to be a cold war era American space capsule. Upon further investigation you realize that this escape pod which was meant to safely return its crew back to earth, is not only missing its crew, it instead has brought something else back.
Your curiosity and unsealing of this space capsule has potentially released whatever was on board, and in doing so it has triggered the ship’s emergency decontamination process “Protocol Zero”. If you do not contain the stowaway and shutdown “Protocol Zero”, this capsule will become your tomb.",2-4,60,Difficult,Not scary,10+,None
