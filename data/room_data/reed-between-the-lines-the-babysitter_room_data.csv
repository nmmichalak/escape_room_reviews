You love when your aunt babysits because she’s fun and playful, not to mention good at making awesome puzzles and booby traps!
Your aunt knows that, ever since you were a little kid, you have always needed your teddy bear with you to fall asleep. To challenge you, your aunt hid Teddy somewhere in your room. Now your bedtime has passed, and if your parents find you awake when they come home, you’ll be grounded. You know that your aunt will never tell you where it is hidden, but she will give you clues along the way.",4-6,60,Average,Not scary,,0.5
