They acted with bravery and sacrificed everything for the good of all.

But darker days have fallen and a new power has turned the tide in the fight of good versus evil.  A syndicate known only as The Pulse has captured three superheroes and is attempting to harness their energy to create their own super-villain.

The only thing standing between them and a reign of chaos is us.  We are the last line of defense.  We are Hyper Enhanced Response Operatives for Emergency Situations, better known as H.E.R.O.E.S.

As part of the H.E.R.O.E.S. team, your assignment is to go undercover as a Pulse operative and try to locate the captured superheroes.  Do everything you can to blend in and don’t let your cover get blown.  This is our one shot to turn back the tide, so let’s make it count.
