"Escape room ""The Cure"" by Enigma Escapes WA in Tacoma",https://worldofescapes.com/tacoma/quests/enigma-escapes-wa-the-cure,"101 S 10th Street Tacoma, WA 98402","Dr. Xavier is a world renown virologist and has just discovered a cure to the 853-472B virus. The problem is no one has seen him since his discovery. We fear there has been a breach in containment within the laboratory.
You and your research team have been contracted to enter the lab, find the cure, find Dr. Xavier, and quarantine the lab. Since virus 853-472B is so contagious, we cannot risk wide-spread exposure, therefore, your team only has one hour to complete its mission before we have to activate the laboratory's self-destruct protocol destroying everything (including you if you fail). Good luck!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
