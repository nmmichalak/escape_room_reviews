Carroll St, Suite 1A, Frederick, MD 21701","The great King Arthur who once wielded the mighty sword known as Excalibur, brought together his loyal knights to determine what would become of the ancient blade. They had grown old and tired and it would soon be time to find a champion worthy enough to wield Excalibur.
