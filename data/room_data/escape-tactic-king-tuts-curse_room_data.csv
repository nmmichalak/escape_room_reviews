"Escape room ""King Tut’s Curse"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-king-tuts-curse,"130 Southside Dr Charlotte, NC 28217","Legend has it that the Egyptian god Aten put a curse on the young King Tut after he made all Egyptians worship the god Amun. This curse can only be broken by reuniting King Tut’s crook and flail – relics of Amun. Nearly 100 years after Howard Carter found King Tut’s tomb in 1922, there is still no sign of Tut’s crook. It is known that in his tomb there is only the flail, but the whereabouts of the crook are unknown and must be paired with it in order to break Aten’s spell.
You and your team of archeologists have been sent to find Tut’s Crook and break Aten’s spell, but legend says that whoever spends more than one hour in Tut’s tomb will also bear the burden of Aten’s curse. You’ll have 60 minutes to break the spell or be cursed forever!",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,10+,0.68
