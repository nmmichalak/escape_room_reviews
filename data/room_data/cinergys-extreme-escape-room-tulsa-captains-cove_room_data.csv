The hook-handed Captain McGinnis, met his love Rose, while plundering the high seas. He kept her near at all times. Sailor’s superstition says it’s bad luck to have a woman aboard, and his crew took this warning to heart. In an attempt to salvage their luck, they mutinied against the Captain, throwing Rose overboard into the sea. Wrought with grief and anger, the captain turned his attention to pillaging any ship he could find. Overloaded with treasure, a wrathful storm brewed overhead. McGinnis desperately tried to save his ship by jettisoning the provisions, then the cannons, and finally – he threw his crew overboard. But, it was not enough to save his precious cargo, and the ship and its treasure wrecked on a deserted beach. Get in, find the treasure, and get out before the Captain returns and impales you on the end of his sword, or a worse fate – from the Ghost of Rose!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,18+,None
