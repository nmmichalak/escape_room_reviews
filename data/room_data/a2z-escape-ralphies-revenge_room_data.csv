"Escape room ""Ralphie's Revenge"" by A2Z Escape in Hays",https://worldofescapes.com/hays/quests/a2z-escape-ralphies-revenge,"2703 Hall St #6 Hays, KS 67601","We saved Christmas and brought an end to Ralphie's Holiday Hijinks. He is not happy about that, to say the least, and has unleashed his revenge on those who foiled his plan to stop Christmas.
Ralphie infected one toy that Santa delivered to each household on Christmas. Unless that toy is found within one hour, it will begin infecting all the toys. No one knows exactly what the infection will do, but given Ralphie's history, it can't be good. You already saved Christmas, now you must save the children from this angry elf's plot to inflict revenge!",1-8,60,Easy,Not scary,,0.8
