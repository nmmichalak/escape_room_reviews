A remote wooded paradise where you can unplug and unwind from the rest of the world. Unfortunately, the car's check engine light has illuminated and shortly after, it breaks down. A couple of your friends went to look for help and have yet to make it back. As night approaches, the rest of you are now worried and decide to go find them. Thinking your luck has changed you see headlights approaching...only to wake up sometime later to your worst nightmare.",4-10,60,Average,None,,None
