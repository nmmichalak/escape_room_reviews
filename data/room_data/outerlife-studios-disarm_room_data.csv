"Escape room ""Disarm"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-disarm,"1942 2nd Ave S, St. Petersburg, FL 33712","""117"" reads the apartment number on the door. You examine your surroundings further noting a mirror on the wall and three other apartment doors. The building has not been well maintained - paint is peeling from the walls, the carpet is dingy and stained and even the air seems old.
For reasons unknown, you have been brought here - no, trapped in here, by someone who intends to watch you die. Your head is still a little cloudy from the sedatives but you remember clearly the threat of a bomb and that it would detonate in just one hour. The door is locked so your only hope for escape is to disarm the bomb.",2-6,60,Difficult,A little scary,10+,0.4
