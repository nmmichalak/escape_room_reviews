CEO Carlotta Mueller thinks that they can turn things around if the staff could just find her great-great-grandfather's old candy bar recipe and start producing it again.
Up to now, no one has been able to find it... but maybe you can. Carlotta will arrive at the factory in an hour, and if your team doesn't have that chocolate bar to show her, the factory is done! Can you find the recipe, produce the candy, and save the factory?",2-8,60,Very difficult,Not scary,12+,None
