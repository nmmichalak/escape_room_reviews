Hey, my name is David! The Zodiac murders are some of the worst unsolved crimes in history. Thankfully, my team and I have created the technology to go back in time and correct the injustices of the past.

Not-so-thankfully, this technology is also mostly untested and extremely dangerous, so our newly-minted Project Capricorn isn't exactly getting a lot of excited volunteers. 

Man, we desperately need volunteers.

We lost the last batch in a time vortex. The mess was indescribable. We were scrubbing down the walls for days.

Anyway, can you and your friends help us out?",4-10,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
