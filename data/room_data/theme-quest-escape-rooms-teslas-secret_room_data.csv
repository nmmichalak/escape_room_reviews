Tesla tried to save us by creating a “timeline switch,” an extraordinary invention that can switch us to an alternative timeline in which our world survives.

There is one problem — the powers that be are trying to find Tesla’s new invention and keep it for themselves. Explore Tesla’s study area, use his secret passage ways, and transport yourself through space and time.

Find out where he hid his timeline switch, then use it to save our world just as he intended. But you must hurry!  The powers that be are returning in one hour, and if they find it before you do, we will be stuck here forever!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,10+,None
