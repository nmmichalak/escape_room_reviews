"Escape room ""Wallingford Five"" by Quandary in New Haven",https://worldofescapes.com/new-haven/quests/quandary-wallingford-five,"346 Quinnipiac Street Wallingford, CT 06492","About thirty years ago, a criminal gang – dubbed “The Wallingford Five” – specialized in brazen bank and jewelry store robberies and burglaries across New England. For years, they were able to elude authorities. You and your task force members have investigated every crime scene and pursued every lead, without success … until now.
You have just received an unexpected break in the case, allowing you to pinpoint the gang’s hideout. You will need to scrutinize, think and communicate with one another expeditiously, as you have a one-hour deadline to identify the culprits before they make good on their getaway.
Oh, and one other thing — solve a murder in the process.",4-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,13+,None
