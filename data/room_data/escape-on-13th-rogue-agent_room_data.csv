Two of your fellow agents have gone missing for unknown reasons. Their assignment was to deliver highly sensitive files to an ally in Poland. The agency has reason to believe the senior, Agent Jones, was captured by hostiles. All the agency knows currently is that the junior on the mission, Agent Stewart, sent the message, “The documents are safe; I’ve hidden them in an abandoned Nazi research facility to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands.” It is your task to recover the highly sensitive files they were assigned to deliver. There are hostile enemy agents in the area seeking to intercept the files. The agency needs someone they can count on to finish this mission. That’s why they are calling on you. Can you escape with the files in hand before the enemy agents catch up to you?",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,8+,None
