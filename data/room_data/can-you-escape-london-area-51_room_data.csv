"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Can You Escape in London",https://worldofescapes.com/london/quests/can-you-escape-london-area-51,"219 Commercial Dr #1 London, KY 40744","The lights that flashed in the sky that night were too bright to be a weather balloon and everyone knows it. The quite skies of Roswell, New Mexico lit up with a hot streak that lasted over four seconds. Anyone who didn’t see surely heard about it the next day, but now nothing, not a word. The government hasn’t made a sound about the white lights that where burning across the sky. In fact they deny it ever happened. Your contact in Roswell Air Force Base has given you access to a top secret area in the facility for you to find the truth about the incident.

You and a select group of reporters have infiltrated the base and have exactly one hour to find extraterrestrial life evidence before the guards are back.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
