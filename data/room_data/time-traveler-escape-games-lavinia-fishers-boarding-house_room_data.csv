"Escape room ""Lavinia Fisher’s Boarding House"" by Time Traveler Escape Games in Charleston",https://worldofescapes.com/charleston/quests/time-traveler-escape-games-lavinia-fishers-boarding-house,"579 King St Charleston, SC 29403","It’s 1818 in North Charleston – and you and your friends have stopped at the Six Mile Wayfarer House after a long day of traveling. You’re on the way to Charleston to conduct important business, but the sun has set and your horses are tired. You can finish your journey in the morning, after a good night’s rest.

The boarding house is run by a cheery woman named Lavinia Fisher, who welcomes you into her home and offers you a cup of tea. Weary from so much traveling, you gladly accept. After settling into your attic bedroom, you realize that you once heard a legend about some travelers disappearing without a trace on the way to Charleston. What could have happened to them? Oddly, you notice a few personal items in the bedroom that look like they could have belonged to other travelers.

You begin to feel overwhelmingly sleepy and strange thoughts creep in your head. Who do these personal items belong to and what happened to their owners? Why can’t you keep your eyes open – could there have been poison in the tea?

Your mission is to search your bedroom for an antidote before you succumb to the poisoned tea and become yet another victim of the murderous Lavinia Fisher, now known as the country’s first female serial killer.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
