"Escape room ""Judgment"" by Lincoln Escape Room in Lincoln",https://worldofescapes.com/lincoln/quests/lincoln-escape-room-judgment,"3700 S. 9th Suite D Lincoln, NE 68502","Judge Clive Hatchet was married to his beloved wife Patricia for 25 years until one fateful night when a thief murdered her in a home invasion gone wrong. The police were able to catch the killer and learn that his name is Victor Bellington; a recently unemployed office worker with no prior criminal background.
During Bellington’s trial, a lack of incriminating evidence led the jury to a not guilty verdict, allowing him to walk free. That day, Judge Hatchet lost his faith in the justice system and has since decided to take the law into his own hands. He took it upon himself to find not only Bellington but every member of the jury–yourself included–who let him walk free.
You’ve now discovered that you and your peers have been kidnapped and imprisoned in Hatchet’s makeshift lair, and it’s you who’s on trial this time. You have 60 minutes to escape captivity before he returns to unleash his vengeance!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,12+,0.28
