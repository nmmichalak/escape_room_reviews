Named for the Greek “Mistress of the Labyrinth”, she is well-known to be laden with traps, puzzles, secret doors, and hidden passages built by Greybeard himself to keep his treasure safe.
Even though you and your group knew The Ariadne could be nearby and were warned to stay away, you still booked passage aboard a small merchant vessel to the Port of Fernandina on Amelia Island. Now you find yourself here, shackled together and awaiting your audience with Captain Slightly Greybeard.
