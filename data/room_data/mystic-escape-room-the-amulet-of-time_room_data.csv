"Escape room ""The Amulet of Time"" by Mystic Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/mystic-escape-room-the-amulet-of-time,"5776 S Rapp St, Littleton, CO 80120","In the ancient times, the old sorcerers forged two magical items to rule the world: The Amulet of Light, and the Amulet of Time. Because of their unlimited power, a secret society was created to protect the amulets from lesser minds. It was called “The Order”.

Legend says that over time, through many wars and conquests, the Amulet of Light was destroyed. So in hopes to protect the Amulet of Time, it was hidden in a room, deep inside Rousseau’s Castle.

Sir Rousseau, the eldest of the members of the Order, has devised a series of puzzles so that only the worthy few who can solve the room in time, shall earn the right to use the magical Amulet.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,14+,0.38
