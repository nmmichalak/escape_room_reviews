"Escape room ""The Body Shop"" by Outside the Box in Webster",https://worldofescapes.com/webster/quests/outside-the-box-the-body-shop,"251 Main St. Rear, Webster, MA 01570","It’s late. Your phone buzzes. You’ve just gotten a notification that a nearby body shop needs a package delivered ASAP. You sigh. But…it’s Congo’s delivery promise, and you’re their closest courier. 

You arrive after closing, and everyone’s gone. “This place looks a little shady”, you think to yourself. You see a few things that seem…strange.  As you leave the package as instructed, the alarm goes off, and the door locks behind you. 

You’d better get out of there before security arrives and starts asking questions! But how are you supposed to escape? You only have 60 minutes to get it figured out! Can you make it?",2-10,60,Difficult,A little scary,12+,None
