"Escape room ""Solitary Confinement"" by A2Z Escape in Hays",https://worldofescapes.com/hays/quests/a2z-escape-solitary-confinement,"2703 Hall St #6 Hays, KS 67601","Someone has been abducted and gone missing. After a thorough investigation, you have uncovered their location in a dark bunker beneath a shack on the edge of town.  This will not be a simple rescue mission, however. The kidnapper leaves only once a day for an hour at most and while he is away, this hostage is secured in a jacket which contains an explosive that detonates if removed from the bunker. You must free this person from the jacket and escape the bunker before the kidnapper returns.  
Oh…and did we mention that the person you must rescue is a member of your own group? Good luck!  And don’t “blow” it!",1-4,60,Average,Not scary,,None
