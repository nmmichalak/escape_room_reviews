Relatives say they have neither seen nor heard from the reformed criminal in a little over a week. Detective Ray Reynolds provided us with the following statement: 
“I remember Albert Mason well from his time spent at the station. He really came a long way. We were all surprised to see his name resurface in such an unfortunate context. We have a list of suspects and are working as hard as we can but quite honestly, we’ve hit a wall. Albert’s family is offering anyone with evidence towards this case who comes forward by midnight a reward for their valuable and speedy information.”
