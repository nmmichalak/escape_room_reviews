It’s time for another boring hour in Mrs. Kimble’s study hall. Playing on your phone is strictly prohibited but you just had to answer that text message sent from your best friend. You feel that dreaded tap on your shoulder and you know you are BUSTED! “Bye bye phone,” says Mrs. Kimble and she deposits it in her vault of confiscated cell phones. You can’t live without your phone so you recruit your friends to help you sneak into Mrs. Kimble’s classroom to retrieve your phone while she is away on her planning period. Can you be stealthy enough to get in and out in an hour? We sure hope so cause if you get caught you will be expelled!",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,,None
