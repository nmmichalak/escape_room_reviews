This is earth long after human extinction. Aliens annihilated your species over 400 years ago, but you and your friends have been reconstituted at the prime of your lives.
Your original genes have been altered to increase your chance of survival; however, half of you have been infected with a virus that has distorted your sense of morals and values.
