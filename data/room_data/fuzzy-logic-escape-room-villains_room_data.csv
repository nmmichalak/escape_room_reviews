"Escape room ""Villains"" by Fuzzy Logic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fuzzy-logic-escape-room-villains,"130 Ogden Ave Downers Grove, IL 60515","MWAHAHAHA! The time to hatch the evil villainous plan is upon us! While the megavillains work on their theatrical monologue, it’s up to you as a ragtag team of villains to scour the underground satellite base to collect the final for the destruction ray gun targeting Megatropolis. Act fast, though – the chemical compounds in the device are unstable and will decompose in one hour. And if there already wasn’t enough time for lollygagging, the heroes surely are trying to track your activity. Figure out which of your accomplices haven’t been compromised by the heroes. You must make your escape before they triangulate your location!",1-7,60,Difficult,Not scary,16+,None
