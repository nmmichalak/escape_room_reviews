This vessel is currently experiencing system failures due to a power overload. There are two astronauts in cryosleep aboard this vessel, we need you to get this ship back to full power or their lives may be in danger. Once all the shipâ€™s systems are back online the astronauts in cryosleep should begin to defrost and warp drive will come back online. Once the warp drive is active, eject yourselves using the escape pods. You have 60 minutes to complete the reboot before life support is cut to the astronauts in cryosleep!
