"Escape room ""Agent 13"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-gate-escape-agent-13,"800 St. Phillip Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802","Hello Agents, You are currently standing in a WW2 ERA Bunker. Upon its discovery last week, one of our best agents was sent here to investigate, but no one has heard from him since. This bunker was believed to have belonged to a brilliant NAZI scientist and spy who infiltrated the US in 1942. It was believed that at the time, he was quietly developing a weapon of mass destruction.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find our missing agent and carry out his last objectives: determine if there is a doomsday device hidden here and if so, disable it at all costs.",4-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,8+,0.2
