However, due to the dominating influence of the oil and gas industrialist Hewitt & Co., Tesla was forced to stop his research and was publicly labeled insane.
As Tesla predicted that natural resources would soon deplete and plunge the world into darkness, he continued to secretly build a power plant able to generate large amounts of electricity in hopes that when the time came, mankind would be prepared.
