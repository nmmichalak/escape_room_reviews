Rumor has it that a near by tavern is known as the resistance stronghold. The leader possesses a special brew that can make you resistant to Drakonâ€™s fire but unfortunately the resistance is not too kind to strangers. You must prove yourself a member of the resistance or face death from them or Drakon if he catches you. You better get going because failure is not an option.
