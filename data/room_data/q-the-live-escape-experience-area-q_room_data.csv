They plan to sell this weapon to the highest bidder. We need you and your team of special operatives to infiltrate their heavily secured Area Q underground bunker, retrieve the extracted bacteria, and blow up the lab, all while not getting caught by the guard!
The experience involves low lighting and is not advisable for young people afraid of the dark. The guard is a live actor who enters the room periodically on patrol - youâ€™ll need to hide or act your way out of trouble!",2-10,60,Difficult,Not scary,13+,0.29
