A Fisherman's Tale is the mind-bending VR puzzle adventure game in which being turned upside down and inside out is not merely a play on words. Playing as Bob, a tiny fisherman puppet, you live alone in your tiny cabin, oblivious to the world outside. When your radio broadcasts a storm alert, you have to get to the top of the lighthouse and turn on the light! But as you try to leave your cabin with the help of some uncanny sidekicks, you realize what's waiting outside is not at all what you expected...

A Fisherman’s Tale is not a video game. It is an escape game experience set in the fisherman's lighthouse in virtual reality. You will experience a realistic adventure as if you were there. This game is designed as a one-player game. Where you become the hero and experience in totally safe situations that would be far too dangerous or just impossible to live in real life.
