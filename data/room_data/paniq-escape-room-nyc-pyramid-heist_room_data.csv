They plan to unveil the collection tomorrow morning, placing it under constant, airtight security and supervision... which means now is your best chance to steal it.
You are a team of master thieves hired by a wealthy collector to get the treasure out tonight. There is a back entrance into the exhibit through one of the Museum offices that will allow you access to the burial chamber. From there, it should be easy to get out without tripping any alarms, so long as you can find out how to open the exhibit door from the inside. You have a one hour window before the guards circle back to that part of the museum. Can you find your way into the exhibit to steal King Sennetâ€™s riches and escape in time?",2-7,60,Very difficult,Not scary,10+,None
