South Daytona, FL 32119","Sparkle the Elf has had it! She had her heart set on being the new Head Carpenter Elf at Santa's workshop after Jingles the Elf retired. However, it didn't happen that way, and now she's going to show Santa and all the other elves just how powerful she really is.
Tools and partially built toys have suddenly gone missing in the workshop and nobody seems to know why. It's becoming a huge problem and Santa is worried that he won't have enough toys for his Christmas Eve trip around the world.
The elves bring you into their cozy workshop and enlist your help with their problem. Can you help them figure out what is going on in the workshop and help them finish the toys for Christmas? It is 11 pm and you have just one hour to get Santa ready to fly around the world.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,None
