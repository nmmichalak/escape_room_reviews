It's the normal Saugus neighborhood and you have always seemed to like your neighbors. Scott is a single man that owns his own handyman business and is usually always in and out. Itâ€™s not unusual to hear him making noise in the garage; vacuuming, sawing, cutting, nothing out of the ordinary. Today is different.

As a neighbor for the last 10 years, you feel compelled to make sure that he is okay and that nothing really went bad.",2-8,60,Difficult,A little scary,10+,None
