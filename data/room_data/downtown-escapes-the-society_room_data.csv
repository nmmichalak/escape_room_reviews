"Escape room ""The Society"" by Downtown Escapes in Goldsboro",https://worldofescapes.com/goldsboro/quests/downtown-escapes-the-society,"208 E Walnut Street Goldsboro, NC 27530","What if there was a ‘secret society,’ a group of people that many heard rumors about, but no one could ever prove existed. A society that was comprised of only the most prestigious and intelligent-- a special club--and to join this society you had to solve a series of puzzles within the city in a specific amount of time. 

Well good news for you! The Society does exist, and you and your team have been chosen to apply to the world’s most distinguished secret society, but you must show that you have what it takes. Those who are a part of ‘The Society’ have all successfully completed the journey that you are about to embark on. 

This 90 minute outdoor experience will be a test of both brains and intuition. Using only your surroundings and what is provided in your backpack, you will need to solve a series of hands-on puzzles and find certain destinations to finish your mission. For every puzzle solved you will accumulate a certain number of points, and to be inducted into The Society you will need to achieve a specific score.

Only the elite ever complete the challenges set before them. Maybe you will be one of the few...but only time will tell. ",2-8,90,Average,Not scary,10+,None
