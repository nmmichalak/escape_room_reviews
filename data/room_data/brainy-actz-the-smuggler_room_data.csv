"Escape room ""The Smuggler"" by Brainy Actz in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/brainy-actz-the-smuggler,"17981 Sky Park Cir Building 39 Suite N, Irvine, CA 92614","For the last decade, the CIA has tracked priceless artifacts that have gone missing in transit, never to be seen again.  All of the crimes are so precise, that by the time anyone realizes they are gone, it is too late. There have been thousands of leads over the years, but the agency has never been able to track down the man they have dubbed, “The Smuggler”.  He is a man with a double life. During the day he appears as a normal citizen, working his 9-5, but by night is when he does his most dangerous work. In the last 24 hours, a rare relic known as the Viking Sunstone has been taken. This prized possession was owned by the legendary Ragnar Lothbrook and utilized as the first compass as the Vikings traveled the high seas.  The Sunstone could sell for millions on the black market. You have received intel of its whereabouts, but you must move quick. If you can retrieve the artifact and return it to it’s rightful owner, you will receive a hefty pay day. But be careful, you do not want to be caught by the villain that is, “The Smuggler”.",2-10,60,Average,Not scary,,None
