Last night was great... wasn’t it? It’s a shame you can’t remember it. What on earth happened? You have to get it together.
You have to catch a cab to the airport in one hour or you'll miss your flight. You finally figured out what hotel you're in but you can't find your wallet or room key. What are you going to do?
