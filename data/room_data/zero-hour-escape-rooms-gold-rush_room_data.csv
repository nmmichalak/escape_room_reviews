The world has fallen into the clutches of fearsome creatures who hunt using sound. The creatures are weakened by unpleasant feedback from sound devices. You have heard of a safe haven that has developed a way to amplify the feedback that disorients the creatures. The price of entry, however, is costly. To enter the safe haven, the inhabitants require your ‘weight in gold.’

You have heard through the grapevine that there is a desolate cabin in the woods that may hold the gold you seek. The cabin was owned by Ol’ Willy, a miner who had amassed a fair amount of wealth. Refusing to leave his land, he placed traps on the property for both trespassers and the creatures, alike. His greed ultimately became his undoing as he met his untimely death at the hands of the creatures. This has left the cabin and Ol Willy’s fortune wide open for anyone brave enough to enter his property. Gather his gold and this could be your ticket to safety.
