Jefferson Blvd., Fort Wayne, IN 46804","Guantanamo Bay detention camp is a United States military prison, also referred to as Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay Cuba. Since the inmates have been detained indefinitely without trial and several inmates were allegedly severely tortured, the operations of this prison camp are considered to be highly controversial.
Two years ago you were taken into custody by the United States military, and wrongfully accused of affiliation with several terrorist organizations across the globe. You have been plotting your exoneration and release since your arrival. Recently, several detainees have been vanishing from their cells and no one knows where they have been taken – but they don’t ever return.
You sense your time is near, and now is your opportunity to prove your innocence. Just as all other detainees, you are being held indefinitely without trial, but you have made a few friends along the way who are willing to help you find freedom. Do you have what it takes to find your way out of your cell, navigate to the prison control room and access the information you need to escape? There are no second chances!",2-10,60,Very difficult,A little scary,6+,0.25
