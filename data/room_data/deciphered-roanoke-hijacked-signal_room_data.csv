One stormy night, during the live broadcast of the show, an ominous call comes in. The only thing you heard was a deep, inhuman voice say “Planet Earth,” before a crack of lightning knocked the power out. The backup generator failed to keep the station broadcasting throughout the outage, and the remainder of the call was not heard.
Your team has one hour to restore power to the station and listen to the rest of the call to figure out what the strange voice was trying to communicate.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,13+,0.3
