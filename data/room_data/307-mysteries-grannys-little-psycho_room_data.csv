The police have set up a command center next to his house and wait until he leaves for his daily hour walk before they send in a group to recover the jewels. Half of the group will be in the command center and half in the mobster’s house working together to find the jewels. Hopefully, the command center can get the back door unlocked and let the group out that was in “Razor Sharp’s” house before he comes back home through the front door. Or else you will find out why he is called “Razor Sharp”...",2-4,60,Average,Not scary,,None
