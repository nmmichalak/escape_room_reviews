Life was peaceful for centuries, but out of nowhere, a terrible sickness spread throughout the kingdom. With so many perishing, something had to be done.

Rumor has it that a mythical tree deep in the elven woods of Gahl-Zaan possess a magic stronger than any known to man, but war against the elves centuries ago has made them distrusting of humans and unwilling to help or trade. With the sickness worsening every day, you don’t have a lot of options. You and your adventuring party have ventured to a nearby castle, once the home of a powerful wizard, that now lies abandoned.

If you can find a way to properly harness the castle's magic, you may be able to create a tool powerful enough to dispel the forest’s magic, but beware: the elves are a cautious race. They've heard your plans and are working to create a magical barrier and if they succeed, you’ll never have a chance of getting anywhere near the tree.
