Beyond Medusa’s Gate is not a video game. It is an escape game experience set in the world of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. You will become the characters, choose your attire, dress the part!

You will experience a larger-than-life adventure as if you were there, 445 BC in Ancient Greece. Never alone, as part of a team (of 2 or 4), you become the hero and experience in total safety, situations that would be far too dangerous or just impossible to experience in real life.
