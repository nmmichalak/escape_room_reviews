Every few minutes, at random, some sick, twisted individual – watching you on camera – will hit a button that loosens the zombie’s chains. For this reason, it is imperative to work together quickly to escape this room. You have a limit of 60 minutes because our zombie does have to eat, after all.",3-8,60,Average,A little scary,,None
