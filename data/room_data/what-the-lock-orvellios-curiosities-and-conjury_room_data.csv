The proprietor has spent decades procuring objects of mystical value and intrigue; only offering them to the highest bidder. While the items available change with time, all possess some value and power to the right person. But there are some items, ancient items, more powerful than others.
Of course, the more omnipotent the item, the more sought after it becomes. There is one such item you are entrusted with retrieving, but be forewarnedâ€¦ the shopkeeper has made sure his items are protected from those who seek to obtain them through plunder; for the item cannot cross the shop's threshold, and its way of exit has not yet been found.",2-6,60,Difficult,None,,None
