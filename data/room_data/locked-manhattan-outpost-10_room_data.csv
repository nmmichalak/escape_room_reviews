"Escape room ""Outpost 10"" by Locked Manhattan in Manhattan",https://worldofescapes.com/manhattan/quests/locked-manhattan-outpost-10,"116 S 4th St #122a Manhattan, KS 66502","There are rumors regarding a curse surrounding the final antiquity the archaeologists unearthed from their dig site near Outpost 10. Roughly a decade ago, doors locked the scientists in, and they were only rescued after being airlifted out of their sleeping quarters. To this day nobody is certain as to what caused the high tech systems to malfunction, and the outpost has remained abandoned since.
You and your companions are not fazed by these rumors and, as seasoned robbers, you have decided to explore the remains of Outpost 10 on your own. You enter through the door that once sealed the archaeologists in and survey your surroundings. There is a loud CRACK, and the door slams shut, repeating history. You hear thunder in the distance and smell smoke in the air, and you realize that you are no longer seeking wealth, but rather an escape route to preserve your life.",1-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,,0.24
