Al’s part owner of a little place called the Moulin, not to be confused with the Moulin Rouge, that was once down the street. This place hosts the swankiest girls and the strongest hooch. Al’s been seeing some nice profits for his Burlesque Show, but over the past few months, Al’s noticed a scanty amount of scratch coming in. He suspects someone is skimming off the top and he’s sending you over to find his dough along with who the culprit is! Remember, you’ll have to keep your eyes focused on “Who Done It” instead of on those showgirls!",2-8,60,Difficult,Not scary,18+,None
