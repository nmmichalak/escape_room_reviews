Since the passing of her husband and the payout of his sizeable life insurance policy, she has suspected the entire family has been trying to steal the inheritance. Now that she has been moved into a nursing home, she is appealing to you, her favourite relative, to enter her condo, retrieve some personal belongings, and arrange to have them sent to her. The inheritance is carefully hidden somewhere in Edna’s condo, and it’s protected by layers of tricks and traps. If you’re clever and quick, you may be able to find this wealth that has eluded many before you.",2-8,60,Average,Not scary,15+,None
