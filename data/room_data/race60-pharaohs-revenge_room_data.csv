"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Revenge"" by Race60 in Windsor (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/windsor-ca/quests/race60-pharaohs-revenge,"8801 Conde Ln Windsor, CA 95492","You’re part of a large archaeological dig team that’s looking for lost artifacts near the Valley of the Kings. Last night a large stash of ancient artifacts was discovered. Instead of starting the morning by examining and cataloging the artifacts, you drew the short straw and had to make a routine supply run into town.
Upon your return, you realize something went terribly wrong. The other members who stayed behind at the dig site are lying outside of the field office, barely conscious and near death. Now it’s up to you to figure out what caused this sickness and help the team before it’s too late.",2-6,60,Difficult,Not scary,,None
