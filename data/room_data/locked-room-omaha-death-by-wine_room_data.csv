Unfortunately for you, his favorite delicacy happens to be of the human variety, and YOU are on the menu!
After being treated to a pre-dinner tasting of his finest wines, he reveals the secret to their complex flavor: a highly potent neurotoxin. The neurotoxin is lethal and activates in about 60 minutes, but being the sporting gentleman that he is, he mentions there’s a hidden antidote within the cellar.

Will you find the antidote in time and make your way to freedom, or be served up on a silver platter?",3-8,60,Difficult,A little scary,6+,0.33
