"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Doctor's Secret"" by Lost Games in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lost-games-escape-rooms-the-doctors-secret,0,"First time at an escape room. Didn't know what to expect. Was for my son's 18th birthday. There was 8 of us ranging from 11 to 45 years old. Lost Games was the perfect for all ages. A little scary, a little nerve racking, clues that all ages can help figure out. Set up is very creative that encourages team work and problem solving. We all had so much fun. Looking forward to going back for the next chapter."
