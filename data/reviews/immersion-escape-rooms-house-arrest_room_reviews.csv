It was our first time going through an escape room, and it definitely exceeded expectations! There's a ton of detail packed into the House Arrest room, both relevant to the underlying storyline and the puzzles. Attention to detail is key to get out and don't forgot to communicate! Had a fantastic date with my other half here and we will definitely be returning for the next room!"

Loved that there is a continuous story to each room here. We got so into House Arrest, the first room, it felt like a real situation I immediately wanted to do the next room and see the continuation of the story! I highly recommend doing this such a great time!"

Mark was a fantastic host. The space is beautiful in the lobby and the rooms feel very real and immersive. This room isn't as linear, but we like linear and non-linear rooms just the same, as long as things make sense. This room is also a minimal tech room compared to many high-tech rooms I've played in Los Angeles (primarily) and they provided a fresh take on a minimal tech room that was a highly solid experience.The way they deliver clues in House Arrest is unique. I usually don't like computerized clue giving, but this one I enjoyed thoroughly. It fits the immersion very well."

We loved it so much that we immediately booked the next room, House Arrest! This experience is so well thought out and immersive. The special effects add so much to the experience and the feel of the rooms. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who loves adventure, mystery, or needs to just escape for a little while."
