"Escape room ""Hunter P.I."" by Hint Hunter Puzzle Rooms in Biloxi",https://worldofescapes.com/biloxi/quests/hint-hunter-puzzle-rooms-hunter-pi,1,"Took my 14-year-old and her friends for a birthday event. I was worried that they wouldn't be entertained - however, they all had a blast doing the P. I. room. They even made it out with mere seconds to spare! Mr. T. J. was a great host and very accommodating to the needs of the party. I can't wait to back and try the rest of the rooms with my family!"
