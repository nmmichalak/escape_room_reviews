"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Mind Bender Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/mind-bender-escape-rooms-jack-the-ripper,0,Can't go wrong with a good drink. This place is a prime location for a team building dinner follow up. Mind Bender Escape Rooms is a couple of doors down from Engine 15. Just close your eyes as you pass the gym. When you do that you'll find this gem. I did the easy room (Jack the Ripper) and still couldn't get out. Frustrating when you know you're looking at the clue and can't put he pieces together. But so much fun working with each other to try to solve the mystery and escape the room. Truly bends the mind! Can't wait to try the other rooms in the future!

I booked the Jack the Ripper room and although we didn't make it in time, it was so much fun! It's harder than you think, and we probably lost a few minutes trying to get started. Would definitely do it again. The people working there were super nice and helpful."
