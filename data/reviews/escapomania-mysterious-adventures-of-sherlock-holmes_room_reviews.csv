It was tough, but we worked together (group of 4) and solved most of the clues. We would've loved to try another one, but we didn't have time."

We did the Halloween one about a year ago and it was fairly simple, but last night we did the Sherlock room and it was much more involved. Both were super fun!"
"Escape room ""Mysterious Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" by Escapomania in Ocean City",https://worldofescapes.com/ocean-city/quests/escapomania-mysterious-adventures-of-sherlock-holmes,2,My family and I were in town for a week and we did every escape room that Escapomania has to offer! A few we made out with only seconds to spare but we escaped from every single one. The Sherlock room was our favorite! It's the most fun you can have even if you don't make it out in time!
