My husband and I had been talking about going to an escape room for a while now. We were on vacation and decided to try it out. We did the FBI Interview and had soooooo much fun. So much, that we immediately did The Heist right after we were done. Puzzles are challenging but not impossible. There is also hints given if you are ever completely stuck. Would definitely recommend. Staff is very personable."

"Escape room ""FBI Interview"" by Riddle Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/riddle-escape-room-fbi-interview,2,Went here for a team building activity with 6 co-workers and it was great! We did the FBI room and it was fun and challenging. They also have earlier times (before 5) so it was perfect for leaving work a little early. We will be back!

We have done close to 40 rooms now and nobody can match the room quality and friendly service that the guys at Riddle provide. We happily paid full price even when other rooms had discounts because the experience they provide is so much better! I can't wait for their 4th room to open!"

Not only did we genuinely enjoy every second of the challenge, but we also found the owner, Tolga, to be an incredibly kind and generous guy. He helped us come up with some ideas so we can bring these types of puzzles back to our campers this summer.When you find something that is both highly entertaining and that is run by amazing people, you don't hesitate. You book your group ASAP!"
