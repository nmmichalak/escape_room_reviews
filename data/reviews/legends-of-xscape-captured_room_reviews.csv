"Escape room ""Captured (Area 51)"" by Legends of Xscape in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/legends-of-xscape-captured,0,We had a party of 5 and we did the Area 51 room. We really had soooooo much fun and I was pessimistic going in!  Special Agent Ryan was terrific.  He gave us great explanation and didn't even make fun of us when we didn't make it out in time(which we really deserved).  Can't wait to go again.
