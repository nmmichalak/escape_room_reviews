They are both awesome. If I have to pick, I'd say Jungle Ransom was my favorite, but it's a hard choice. These are both wonderful, fun experiences for friends, couples, families, anyone. Great date activity!"
"Escape room ""Dr. Zylchov's Lab"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Escapism-Portland-The-Lab-of-Dr-Zylchov,5,"I did Dr. Zylchov's Laboratory with my husband; it was my second escape room and his first. We had an amazing time here! The puzzles were really neat and fun to solve and even when we had to ask for hints it was fun and well done. After doing Dr. Zylchov's lab I'm completely hooked on escape rooms and can't wait to check out The Ritual Room. I highly recommend this escape room! It was totally manageable for just the two of us but it is a smaller space and I'd imagine it would be more crowded with the full 6 people, though still totally doable and a lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Dr. Zylchov's Lab"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Escapism-Portland-The-Lab-of-Dr-Zylchov,6,"Dr Zylchov's Labortory was extremely fun. You step in the building and the experience already starts with the full in character scientist, which has been very smartly chosen. You can even put on props like giant leather gloves or a lab coat. The clues really get you thinking and all tie together. Not going to reveal any of the details but I can say that if you cooperate it becomes a really fun time. Just be careful, in what feels like no time at all you start to realize that your count down gets exponentionally smaller. By the end you don't regret the hour of time at all. This experience is well worth the money and even made me think of getting a job in the field of mystery or scare."
