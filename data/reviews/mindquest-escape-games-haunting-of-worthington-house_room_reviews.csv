"Escape room ""Haunting of Worthington House"" by MindQuest Escape Games in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/mindquest-escape-games-haunting-of-worthington-house,0,"I have done escape rooms all over the East Coast and this is the one you need to go to in West Palm. We (2 players) did both the diamond heist and haunted room. Haunting room would be the most immersive in my opinion. Can accommodate a larger group than 2 people, for sure. However, I loved the puzzles in Diamond Heist. Game master was super friendly and helpful. I love rooms being realistic, intuitive puzzles, and great themes. This had all of it. Great experience. "

My team and I didn't get out in time but in my defense we were hesitant to try anything out because we were scared of stuff jumping out at us. Besides the spookiness of it, it was a great challenge! Very creative and well-done. The game masters were also super helpful along the way. Would definitely go back to try the other (less scary) rooms."

They allowed us to rent out all three rooms and do a cheese platter, etc. IT WAS SUCH A BLAST! My group was in the haunting room. It was soooo fun! it was a little tricky and difficult at times but all that did was make us even happier and more proud when we finally made it out. Thank you David and your entire team for making this such a great time for all of us! I will be back and we will be recommending this to many!"
