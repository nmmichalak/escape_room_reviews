"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Charlotte in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/breakout-games-charlotte-runaway-train,0,I had an amazing time with my team as we worked together to get the train to stop. I can't wait to go again!

This was the first escape room for my husband and I, but we played with our two 20 year old daughters who’ve done escape rooms past, which was a huge help. We all loved it. The very friendly and encouraging attendant was available to provide clues, however, so I think beginners could do this room. We chose Breakout Games because all the rooms are private without an extra charge. Highly recommend. We’ll be back to do other rooms at Breakout!"

Assistance was available and offered when needed, but we were basically on our own and proud of our accomplishment of stopping the train! Highly recommended! Clean, complete and so much fun!"

This was our first time doing an escape room - it was myself, my husband, and stepson (15yo).  When we arrived we were greeted by our Game Master, Donni, whose positive energy was infectious!  We completed the Runaway Train room with barely any time to spare.  Donni helped us through clues when we were stuck and made the whole experience even that much better.  Definitely recommend!!!"

It was amazing and so much fun.  Once our entire group arrived at Breakout, we were greeted by our gamemaster and explained the rules (i.e. - if it's nailed to the wall...don't remove it).  We were then led into our escape room..... The Runaway Train.  This was my first escape room, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  In this room you must find the key to unlock the conductor's area of the train in order to stop the train before it crashes.  We needed a few clues along the way, but managed to escape the room with 3 minutes remaining.  Without giving anything away, the secret compartments and effects in this room were great.  I can't wait to try another room!"
