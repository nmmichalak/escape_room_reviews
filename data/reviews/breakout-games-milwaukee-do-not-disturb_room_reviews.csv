I would highly recommend: she was funny and gave just the right amount of help! I can't wait to come back and play new rooms!!!"
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-do-not-disturb,1,Had to come again due to the awesome experience we had yesterday. Miah was a great help when it came to asking for clues. Our group broke out for the do not disturb. If your looking for a great for a great experience for you and some friends or even a date. Would definitely recommend it.
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-do-not-disturb,2,"We did the Do Not Disturb room with a group of two. It had a lot of unusual, creative puzzles that required thinking very much outside the box... which might have made it too difficult if it weren't for our gamemaster, Krystyna, who did an excellent job being attentive and giving us helpful hints when we needed them. (We still didn't escape, but came close.)This room was fairly linear, so there aren't really a ton of puzzles to be working on at any given time. However, many of the puzzles require enough creative thinking that I feel like having a larger group would be helpful for brainstorming purposes."
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-do-not-disturb,3,"We have participated in several rooms at this location. We love it because you aren't partnered with strangers if your group isn't big enough, and you can get unlimited clues. All of the hosts we've had have been good - friendly and encouraging and seem to really enjoy what they are doing. Most recently Russell helped us in Do Not Disturb. He read our group well and let us figure out most everything on our own, unless we asked for help (which is exactly what we wanted!). Hope to see more turnover in adding new rooms so we can try them all!"
"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/breakout-games-milwaukee-do-not-disturb,4,"We played the ""Do Not Disturb"" escape room and the room itself was amazing. We have come here several times before and we have loved the experiences. This particular room was tricky and well put together but sadly, we did not make it out in time. Gabe was our game master and he was very friendly, but he lacked in giving sufficient hints to us. When we asked for hints, he would give us the answer without even explaining how he got it and if he didn't give us the answer, his hints wouldn't even make sense. Every other time that we have gone to Breakout Milwaukee, our game master has showed us how to get out if we failed to do so. It seemed like Gabe was in a hurry to get us out and didn't explain how to finish the room. We are disappointed that this experience wasn't like the other ones we have had. "
