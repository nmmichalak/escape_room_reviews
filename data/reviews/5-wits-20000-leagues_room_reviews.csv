Ellen was our guide, and she was excellent with the the kiddos. We did 2000 Leagues under the sea, which did require the kids to think alot. I would highly recommend, but i do not think parents should NOT have to pay when going in the tour with their kids who may be nervous; Especially since we were paying hundreds of dollars. With that, i would go again and loved the experience!"
