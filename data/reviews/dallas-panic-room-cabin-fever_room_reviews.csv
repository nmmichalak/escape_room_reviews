"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/dallas-panic-room-cabin-fever,0,We did the Cabin Room for my son's 15th birthday. It was very challenging as it was our first time doing an escape room but we made it out with 2 seconds left. Would love to come back and try another room. Very fun for a group!

"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by Dallas Panic Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/dallas-panic-room-cabin-fever,2,My co-workers and I went last night! We did the Cabin Fever themed room and it was really fun! There were four of us total and we completed with 12:17 remaining. The room was well decorated and sufficiently challenging. I may be going back tonight if there are openings are we aren't too wiped out after work haha. I wish it waa slightly colder just to feel the full effect of the blizzard or it got gradually cooler as you are running down on time. Would have also loved to hear some wind/blizzard sound effects. Loved it!

We had two departments attend, one in ""cabin fever"" and the other in ""abandoned school room"" What a challenge! Thank you Steve, Danny and Nam for being great hosts!"

Challenging at first, as to all newcomers, I guess, but then we got the hang of it! Both teamwork and differentiation required. Alexander was of great help and had a good sense of humor as well. I would definitely recommend this to a group looking for something fun and new."
