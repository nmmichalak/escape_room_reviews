"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escapology-tewksbury-shanghaied,2,Love this place. My son and his wife and family were visiting MA for the weekend and we decided to stop through. We played and escaped the Shanghaied room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating but the real MVPs were OB aka Other Billy and the Manager Christina. They rock!
