"Escape room ""Dracula"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-dracula,0,It's a three room.  You go to a room find a way to another and then third one opens..  Mostly opening coffins.  It's well designed but mostly easy if you pay attention
"Escape room ""Dracula"" by Quest Factor in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/quest-factor-dracula,1,"Today I did the Dracula Room in Redmond with 3 other people. This is the 4th escape room my husband and I have done -- all at different companies. Quest Factor is by far our favorite/the best one we've done. The d√©cor was amazing and the puzzles were interesting and varied. They also ALL worked. (Two other places had broken puzzles, and another basically only had the same kind of puzzle repeated over and over, so not very fun.) I would definitely recommend this place and plan to go back."
