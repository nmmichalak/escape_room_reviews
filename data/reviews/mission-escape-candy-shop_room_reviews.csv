The staff was amazing, funny and very connecting to the participants. Directions were clear and the mystery was even better. Did the Candy Shop - we had fun, laughed and ready for another go. Great place!"

Challenging at times, and fun clues. Besides the candy all over the room, there were several puzzles and clues to sort out... locks and other interesting things made it a great night. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience here and will definitely recommend this place. Definitely check them out!"
