We had 4 in our group and it was cool to see the family working as a team. We had so much fun we booked the Hollywood room the next day! Highly recommended for those who like to figure out puzzles.

We got paired up with three strangers who were all about solving it and together, we conquered (with the help of an extra few minutes). The mystery was great yet challenging.

It was moderately challenging-the puzzles were more involved than just finding combinations, we actually had to solve different kinds of puzzles that were very different and it took multiple people helping out for some of them. It was a fun room and the owner was very nice!"
