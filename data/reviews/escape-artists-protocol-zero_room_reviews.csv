"Escape room ""Protocol Zero"" by Escape Artists in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-artists-protocol-zero,0,"I did the Protocol Zero room with my three teenage boys. We really enjoyed this theme and the puzzles. I think I like it better than Cat Burglar and found it a little easier, despite the company telling that Protocol has a slightly lower escape rate. They did a really good job on the props. A few things are a little startling, but nothing really scary. We escaped with less than two minutes. Give it a go!"
"Escape room ""Protocol Zero"" by Escape Artists in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-artists-protocol-zero,1,"My boyfriend has been telling me about the awesome reviews Escape Artists has gotten and we finally decided to take the drive and escape here. I am so happy we did because we had such a great time. Even though we got there a little late, the guy that helped us (sorry I forgot names) was super nice and welcoming. He immediately got us in the room and gave us instructions. The room itself, Protocol Zero, was incredible. The technology was super advanced, everything was connected and organized so well. It was a really well thought out room. We were able to escape, but we were not left confused as to how things worked, we knew exactly how everything worked and how everything was connected. I really appreciate the detail and thought that was put into this room. I would definitely recommend coming here! Even if you live in Orlando, it is totally worth the drive!"
