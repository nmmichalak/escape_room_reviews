"Escape room ""Parallax"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/Memphis-Escape-Rooms-Parallax,0,"Our gaming group of 9 adults did this as our very first Escape Room. It's quite technical. We found ourselves completely stuck and stumped over and over. Thank goodness the staff gave us clues, or we would have not made any progress at all. I would not recommend this room for children under the age of 12. The clues are simply too advanced for small kids. Great surprise elements. Very well-designed room layout. Wonderful atmospheric effect created with minimalist decor.  "

We got hung up once or twice trying to recognize patterns, but all in all it was a fun and different style than the fantasy ruin type I did before. The lights and music really added to the experience. We escaped with 10 minutes remaining!"

Puzzles are hard, and so fun to work together to try and solve. We did Parallax. Highly recommend this for families, groups of friends, or co- workers. Proud of Memphis, and it's newest attraction."

I called last minute to book a time for me and my coworkers, and keith said he'd call me back if they got one... 5 minutes later he called and said the other people r/s'd their time so we got the time we wanted! It worked out perfect, Thank you so much Keith!!!"

The rooms were challenging and fun, and the staff was amazing! We had car trouble and they worked with us to accommodate our time delay. They cheered us on when we won (escaped), and were all-around friendly and helpful! We conquered The Carnival and Parallax, and will definitely be back to escape the other two rooms! Thanks to Keith and the rest of the team. We had a great time for my husband's 30th birthday."
