Fun room, really enjoyed it. The room had a good combination of locks, puzzles and electronics. The room flowed really well.  Have done many rooms and this ranks at the top!  We will definitely be back for the Houdini room when it opens!"
"Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-noras-nightmare,2,"Played Nora's Nightmare yesterday and, it turned out, we were the first group to play the room since it officially opened.  As enthusiasts (almost 200 rooms played), we're always hesitant to try a brand new game as we've quickly learned it's much better to give them some time (even after beta testing) to fine tune things and make sure it runs they way they intended. But since we were jonesing for a room, we decided to go for it. From the first point of contact, via FB messenger, their customer service was spot on. The owner (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name) was friendly, very accommodating and responded to my inquiries quickly. As for the room, we enjoyed it quite a bit! I loved the unique theme and really liked the thought and details that were put into the aesthetics of the room. The puzzles are a good mix of lock & key as well as some tech so it should easily appeal to a variety of players. They are not overly difficult but they do still provide a good challenge and make you slow down to think. We are a two-person team and we finished with time to spare.  Afterwards, we spent quite a bit of time talking shop with the owner. She was very personable and didn't make us feel rushed or like she had something better to do. I know I already said it, but the customer service was on point with Puzzling Escape. As much as we love playing rooms, we also love talking with the owners and staff about the experience as well as about escape rooms in general.  We really enjoy hearing about what went into the design and development of their rooms and just learning about how it all started for them. We can't wait for their other rooms to open. Nora's Nightmare is a fun time for anyone looking for something neat to do. Regardless of your level of experience, get out there and play this game.  You'll be glad you did."
