We were blindfolded and put in separate rooms to work as a team to get out. We got far in our hour of time but unfortunately, we didn't get out. The whole experience was awesome. most definitely will recommend this place. Recommend to family and friends visiting California."
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-espionage,1,Fun! We were walking by and weren't planning on going but after the greeter explained it to us we decided to give it a try. We decided to do the Espionage one since it was the least scariest because we had children with us. We would love to come back and do another room!
