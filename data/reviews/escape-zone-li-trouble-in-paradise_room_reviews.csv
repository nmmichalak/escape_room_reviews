"Escape room ""Trouble in Paradise"" by Escape Zone Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-zone-li-trouble-in-paradise,0,My family and I (9 and 5 year Olds) took a trip and didn't know what to expect but what a great time we had! We had never done any escape room before and Brendan was the perfect amount of being helpful but not giving anything away. The room was done up completely professionally and the different challenges seem creative. We can't wait to go back now that we can strategize better.
