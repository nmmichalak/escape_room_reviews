"Escape room ""Ruin Raiders"" by Missing Pieces Escape Games in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/missing-pieces-escape-games-ruin-raiders,0,First escape room with my work team and we LOVED it! We played Ruin Raiders and the game kept us on our toes the entire time. Luckily we made it out with just 6 minutes to spare (after some clues). Will definitely be back to play another room!

I loved how the puzzles ending up working together in the way they did. This was a challenging but fun room. There were a total of 4 adults and a 15 year old and we figured it out with a minute and a half to spare.

"Escape room ""Ruin Raiders"" by Missing Pieces Escape Games in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/missing-pieces-escape-games-ruin-raiders,4,By far one of the best escape rooms! Went with a group of 5 for the Ruin Raiders room and had an absolute blast! Had so much fun that we NEEDED to see the other room. We did both rooms in one night. Both rooms were very well thought out and the clues were clever and had a story. Extremely friendly family that works there also! Definitely recommend these rooms to everyone!!!
