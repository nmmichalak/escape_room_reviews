It was a great quality room with interesting puzzles at just the right level of difficulty for a group that had not done escape rooms before. We made it out with two clues and five minutes to spare. We will definitely return to try out one of their other rooms. Recommended!"

It took us a few minutes to get the first clue. We needed the problem solving skills of all 3 of us (3 generations ranging from teen to a grandfather) to get the clues. We would be cheering and laughing and then try to be very analytical in solving the next clue. Although we didn't escape in the allotted time it was still a wonderful and memorable experience."
