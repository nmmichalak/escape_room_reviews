"Escape room ""Western Bank Heist"" by Escape the Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escape-the-room-denver-western-bank-heist,0,We had a great time doing the Bank Heist room. There were 4 of us and that was plenty but I could totally see it being more fun with more people. Morgan was great at giving us clues when we needed them. The bank room was challenging yet a lot of fun. I would definitely go back if I lived in the area.
