"Escape room ""Through The Looking Glass"" by The Escape South Florida in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/the-escape-south-florida-through-the-looking-glass,1,We did the Alice themed room. It was very challenging and frustrating in a good way. I definitely think this was one of the best rooms I did.

It was very well paced, not so hard that you get stuck on one clue for a long time but not so easy that you're out quick. We did the Alice in Wonderland room and the amount of detail and whimsy that was put into it was fantastic. Now to go back and do the other room!"

I did the Alice in Wonderland one, there were multiple rooms, the puzzles were challenging but not impossible. We completed the escape with a minute to spare. The owner was there and was super cool."
"Escape room ""Through The Looking Glass"" by The Escape South Florida in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/the-escape-south-florida-through-the-looking-glass,4,"We are on a family vacation and it was raining today, so we were looking for something fun to do.  We have always wanted to do an escape room but couldn't find one that felt the themes were appropriate for our 10-year-old. However, we found this adventure to be fun and exciting for everyone. Kevin, the owner was very helpful when we needed help. He was committed to helping us get through to the end and we felt a great sense of success in accomplishing the ""Through the Looking Glass"" room. This adventure was family friendly for our young teen and pre-teen family."
