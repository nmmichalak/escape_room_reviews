"Escape room ""Queen Anne's Revenge"" by Victor Valley Escape in Hesperia",https://worldofescapes.com/hesperia/quests/victor-valley-escape-queen-annes-revenge,0,"This was our 5th and best escape room experience. Our group really enjoyed the whole adventure.  It was really well done.  The puzzles were fun and challenging. There were some clever and surprising ideas that we were still talking about on the way home. We liked the props and professionally done room design.  The staff were helpful and friendly, especially Chelsea. :) We are looking forward to going back when they open their second room.  Great work Victor Valley Escape!"
