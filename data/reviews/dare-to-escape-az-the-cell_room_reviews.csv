The staff was encouraging, friendly, and explained everything perfectly. The room was incredibly challenging and our team of 6 made it out with only 38 seconds left! You really feel immersed in the storyline. We'll definitely be coming back to try another room!"

It was incredibly challenging. We did not escape, however had a ""blast"" trying to. The studios are clean, staff was friendly. I would recommend for a work team, a birthday party, or just a great night out. Other rooms are smaller, we would have had to split up. Thanks to the Team and the staff at Dare to Escape. At least we dared!"
