Cool concept, clever props and challenging puzzles. The six of us literally made it out with one second left. Mad dash towards the end proved successful. Great friendly staff. We will definitely be back."
"Escape room ""The Clockwork Caper"" by Perplexity Games in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/perplexity-games-the-clockwork-caper,1,I did the Clock Caper with 5 of my friends and we all had a great time. It was fun to work together and the clues and room decorations were really cool. I can't wait to come back and do the Elliot Ness challenge. The people who worked there were also nice and the puzzles are challenging but also doable.
