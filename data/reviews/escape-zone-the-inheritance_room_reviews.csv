"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Escape Zone in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-zone-the-inheritance,0,My husband and I came here on a double date night and it was way more fun than your regular dinner and a movie. We did the Inheritance room and although we didn't escape in time we put a decent amount of clues together and can't wait to try another one! Also the staff was so funny and helpful.

This company shines in immersion and storytelling. (I am also a huge fan of their hint systems.) Overall, the puzzles in both games were incredibly creative. I enjoyed the use of both physical and mental tasks. The space and decor were impressive, as well. Escape Zone AZ has created a clever, fun, immersive experience that is fun for all ages. I highly recommend booking your escape room experience with them."
