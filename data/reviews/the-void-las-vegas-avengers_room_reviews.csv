You use all your senses. Sight, smell, touch, and so on. My son said it was the best virtual experience he’s ever done. We’d do it again for sure."

This was my first time and it was insane amazing. The total immersion, the sound design, the smells that match the images, the whole experience was like something from the future. Extremely well done story and game play, i would do this again in a heart beat."
