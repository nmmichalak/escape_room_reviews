"Escape room ""Pirates of the Bermuda Triangle"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-pirates-of-the-bermuda-triangle,0,"I went to the new location this weekend with my boyfriend- we did the pirate room. Upon stepping out of the elevator we were greeted by some friendly staff that gave us the low down on the whole process. Once we got into the room we were prompted with some back story and instructions to help us, and it was game time. The puzzles were perfect: enough to keep us occupied and interested, but also never so easy that we could solve them by a glance. Every room I do at Clue Chase keeps getting better, and it's the perfect place for a rainy afternoon. I will definitely be back with some friends to see how fast we can get out of the new Houdini room. So fun!"
