"Escape room ""The Illusionist"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-the-illusionist,0,"Surprised by the glowing reviews of this room. My group of five has done about 20 escape room across the nation, and this was not the worst we've done, but not the best.The decor looked old, dirty, and worn out. It also seemed quite sparse, like someone threw this room together hastily in their garage or something. The puzzles were okay, but one of them seemed completely nonsensical and we're not sure how average folks are intended to guess how it works without assistance. Maybe we're dumb, but there's only one room we didn't completely in our entire history of playing escape games; And we rarely ever ask for clues..So, who's to say?I would recommend the Six Shooter room over this one any day. Also - Locks locks locks galore! Not our favorite escape room attribute. "

The rooms were very well thought out and the puzzles were clever. All the puzzles were interactive and involved different mechanics. We had a large group, but there were plenty of puzzles for everyone to participate."

It was a great time and the puzzles and clues were very well thought out. Every solve felt like an accomplishment and even all us tech support nerds barely solved it with less than 4 minutes left on the clock. Great time, recommend it for anyone!"
