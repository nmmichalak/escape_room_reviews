"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-museum-heist,0,Our four-person team did the Museum Heist and escaped with less than 3 minutes to go. There were parts where there were audible gasps and yelps from players. Also Seth was awesome.

Our Game Master was very helpful without making it too easy or too hard. Our entire family (including a 16yo and a 7yo) had a blast, and we escaped with 30 seconds to spare. I would highly recommend these rooms to anyone. The room had lots of puzzles that you were able to follow the progression and didn't have to over think to solve them. Excellent escape room."
