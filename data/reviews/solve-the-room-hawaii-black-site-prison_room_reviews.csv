"Escape room ""Black Site Prison"" by Solve the Room Hawaii in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/solve-the-room-hawaii-black-site-prison,0,"Our least favoriteroom from this company. Theming was okay, cooperative puzzle design was good. There were too many red herrings that wasted our time rather than having more interesting puzzles to solve. The construction of the room was a bit flimsy. Photos placed on the wall in critical positions were pinned and fell off the wall instead of screwed in place. There were arrows drawn on duck tape that was worn off making a major puzzle difficult to solve. Both caused us to waste time. This room needs maintenance. The one electronic puzzle was frustratingly “finicky” as the game master put it. We knew the solution but had to fiddle with the puzzle components for 5 minutes before the game master came in and make it work. When the gamemaster enters the room it breaks up the immersion of the experience. This really needs to be fixed. The hint system used a radio. Players should have their hands free. The radio had multiple channels and the one correct channel was changed by mistake. The game master never told us what channel we needed so he had to enter the room to help which breaks up the immersion of the game. All of this is unavoidable. A better hint system uses the cameras and audio with hints displayed on the timer monitor. Please fix."
