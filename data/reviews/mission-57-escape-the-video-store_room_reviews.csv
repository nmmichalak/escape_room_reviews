"Escape room ""Escape the Video Store"" by Mission 57 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/mission-57-escape-the-video-store,1,"Looks like a very simple design, but don’t let that fool you! Had an awesome time with this challenge. Couldn’t stop talking about it for the rest of the day. If you ask for clues, they are a little hard to hear, but they are helpful without being super obvious. Good job!"
