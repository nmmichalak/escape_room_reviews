"Escape room ""Breakfast Club"" by Escaping the Square in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escaping-the-square-breakfast-club,0,I went out with a couple of friends and it was one of the most fun nights of my life! We will go back real soon.
"Escape room ""Breakfast Club"" by Escaping the Square in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escaping-the-square-breakfast-club,1,"This was our third time doing and escape room at Escaping the Square in Denton. As always, they were extremely friendly. We were with our group of 4 and there was another 2 women that did this particular room---The Breakfast Club theme. So fun! Each time we have done a room at this place they have made it different and fun. We escaped just in time and are looking forward to the next theme they come up with!"
"Escape room ""Breakfast Club"" by Escaping the Square in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escaping-the-square-breakfast-club,2,"First of all - please don't judge this place from it's initial appearance; it's so much more. This place is a mom-and-pop shop, but they definitely care about escape rooms and people having fun there. I have done over 30 escape rooms, and this one is very worth your time (read: more than just locks and codes to more locks). There is some good tech and well thought-out puzzles.We did the Breakfast Club room, and it was very much worth it. Great puzzles, very fun staff, and it was BYOB (not sure if that's public knowledge, but it enhanced the experience). I would highly suggest this place and I hope that they continue to get more business because this place is a gem."
