I loved everything about it. We did the Vaccine. The staff was great, the room was great, the twists and puzzles were a challenge and a lot of fun! I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back and try one of the other rooms."

This is a very challenging and fun time. There are dozens of puzzles and each one brings its own challenges. Will was an amazing host. He knew how to help us along to avoid frustration, but not just give the answers away. Great time! Just remember, it is hard so bring your thinking caps."
