"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/breakout-games-boston-do-not-disturb,0,"Been here twice. Both times it was loads of fun and the staff couldn't have been nicer / fun to interact with. Nice to have ample parking as well and they have multiple different fun challenges. If you're using Google maps to go there, the maps say you arrive before you do; just keep going around to the back."

We did two in one day this weekend at Breakout Games (Boston) and it was so fun! The staff were so friendly and helpful! Their rooms are challenging and an absolute blast!

I love the movies National Treasure and DaVinci Code. Escape rooms are my new favorite thing! Today my family and I beat the Do Not Disturb room with 8 minutes left. So psyched! It was so much fun! Can’t wait to beat another one.
