Our host was excellent in everything, so courteous and friendly. The price is worth it. The boys and friends had a blast. We are looking forward to go again."
"Escape room ""Vacation Vandals"" by Key Quest in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/Key-Quest-Vacation-Vandals,2,Our daughter and her friends did the escape room and they said it was OK. Kind of cheesy for 15 year olds. They had fun just not something they want to do again. Staff was super friendly and very informative.
