The staff was friendly and helpful, the game was so much fun! Our game master, Emma was so great and gave the perfect hints to help us without giving anything away. This was an excellent date to share with my partner and I have no doubt that I will return to share it with my friends!"

I had only ever been to one but this was pretty fun. It was tough but Kyle, or guide was super helpful. I'm sure it would have been more exciting if we had more people in our group to help out."
