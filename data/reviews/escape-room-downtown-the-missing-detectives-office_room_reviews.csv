The experience is unique, and the ""Missing Detective's Office"" has little hints of Canton's history scattered throughout! We really loved our experience and will absolutely be back for more fun! To those looking for a new experience - this would be great for families with kids of all ages, couples, groups of friends, and more. It is a great way to challenge your mind and enjoy a night out!"

We had a group of 6 and then an extra couple was with us, we all jelled great. The staff were friendly, location is easy to find and the Detective's Room was a blast! I only wish they had more of these rooms to do! I can't wait to check out the new room."
