"Escape room ""The Hatch"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-the-hatch,0,We have now played Operation Blackstone and The Hatch. We have played many games around the area and Escape Fla is in our top three. Ryan and the team made the experience a lot of fun and the games were very challenging. I recommend you make plans to go if you havenâ€™t already.
"Escape room ""The Hatch"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-the-hatch,1,This was our first time doing an escape room. We did The Hatch and we all enjoyed it thoroughly!!! Definitely going back for the other rooms!!
"Escape room ""The Hatch"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-the-hatch,2,"My husband and I went last night along with some family and friends last night to do The Hatch room. We were somewhat slow to start, but once we got into the groove of the room and proceeded with the clues, we had a blast! It felt like we were in the simulated situation while in the room. The owner was very helpful with clues to guide us without giving too much away. It was the best escape room I've been to in the Tampa Bay Area thus far. A huge bonus, you get a ""secret beer"" as part of the Secret Ale Society for completing your escape room. All around great experience! We will return!"
