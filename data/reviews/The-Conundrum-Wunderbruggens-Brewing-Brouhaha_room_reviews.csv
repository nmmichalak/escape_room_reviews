"Escape room ""The Brewery of WunderBrugghen"" by The Conundrum in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/The-Conundrum-Wunderbruggens-Brewing-Brouhaha,0,"Our family of 4 had a great time in the Brewery escape room. While we did not make it out in time, we have all been inspired to come and try again in another scenario. This was our first ""escape room"" experience and we enjoyed our guide Max but will know next time to ask better questions and take advantage of our host as a resource to solve the mystery."
"Escape room ""The Brewery of WunderBrugghen"" by The Conundrum in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/The-Conundrum-Wunderbruggens-Brewing-Brouhaha,1,The Conundrum is an awesome place to visit. It has an eccentric feel - like you are stepping back in time. The atmosphere is totally fun and challenging - especially the escapes. The staff was equally just as impressive. I recommend it to locals and visitors.

It's interactive with a live character and it not just a ton of locks like others I have tried. I just tried the brewmaster room and it was very entertaining. I would highly suggest to anyone!"
