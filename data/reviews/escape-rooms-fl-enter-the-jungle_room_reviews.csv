"Escape room ""Enter the Jungle"" by Escape Rooms FL in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-rooms-fl-enter-the-jungle,1,My daughter wanted to have her birthday at an escape room with friends.  The owner was very accommodating for our large group and offered two rooms at the same time.  We did the Jungle room and Game of Stones.  All the teens had an amazing first time in an escape room.  Amazing lobby and service A+++.  All had fun and laughs even though they did not escape.  Great memories and pictures.  Will return again.

A full hour of puzzles to solve and escape! The owner and staff were amazing.

Entering this room was like walking into a Jungle.  We actually were able to play the board game and so much fun.  Very challenging puzzles and critical thinking with communication skills needed for this room.  Great for all especially enthusiasts.  Highly recommend this room and business which is family owned who offered us VIP service and amazing decor.  Going back to try their Game of Stones room.
