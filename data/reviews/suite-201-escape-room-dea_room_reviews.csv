My children tagged along ages, 8,9, and 15 and it was very family friendly in the DEA room.  They were easily contacted via phone and easily booked the room online."

We had such a fun time doing this escape room. It was a Saturday when we went and we did the DEA room and loved every minute. This escape room has you so immersed, you feel like a real agent haha! You actually feel at one point that you're it's real life. The owner is so personable, professional and so cool. He answers all your questions and explains everything very thoroughly. Definitely will be coming back to do some of the other rooms. We found this place on Groupon and it was absolutely worth it.Thank you for a great Saturday night!"
