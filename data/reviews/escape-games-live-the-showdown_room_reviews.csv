"Escape room ""The Showdown"" by Escape Games Live in York",https://worldofescapes.com/york/quests/escape-games-live-the-showdown,0,"Absolutely insane! Loved every second of it! We played Guys vs. Gals in The Showdown and it was everything I had hoped it would be! I want to throw a shout out to our helpful host, Tori! Great introduction to the game, perfectly timed hints, & anyone who can still be nice to us after seeing the mess we made is one heck of a host! :) We will, no doubt, be returning to play the other rooms including the children's room that my kids have already decided is where they want their birthday party, lol. Thanks again!"

We have done other escape rooms in the past but never one where we got to split into teams and battle each other! Loved that there were puzzles in the waiting room and all sorts of props for photos and other fun. Our host, Alex, was awesome. He answered all of our questions, had a great sense of humor, and gave just the right amount of clues. Thanks for a great time! We will definitely be back!!!"
