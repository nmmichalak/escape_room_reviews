Our host, Carl helped make our escape one of a kind. He was incredibly accommodating and informative throughout the entire process. Alan gave us a helpful intro tutorial and answered all of the (many) questions we had. The facility was clean and the room & the props in it were realistic. The difficulty level was undoubtedly enough to keep us fully engaged and with Carl's monitoring, we never felt discouraged. We loved it so much we booked the other Professor Ransom PhD room for tomorrow. I would highly recommend checking out the Great Escape Maricopa!"
