Neither of us had done this before and thought we should take a look. We weren’t planning on signing up, but, after hearing a great sales pitch, we figured we’d go for it. We signed up for the Clock Tower room, and, as it happened, we were the only 2 in the room. It was a blast. The puzzles were hard, but the hints were very helpful. We made it all the way to the very last puzzle where, sadly, we ran out of time. The experience defintely whetted my appetite for another room escape. Hopefully we’ll get to do this again before long."
"Escape room ""The Clock Tower"" by Escape The Room Chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-chandler-the-clock-tower,2,What a fun experience we had there. Got a group of tattooed hooligans together to have a bit of fun Tuesday night and decided to give the new place a try. It was my first experience ever doing an escape room while some of the group do them all the time. Dj was our host for the clock tower room. It's brand new so they ran on to some technical difficulties while dj was left there alone and we could tell DJ was getting a little frazzled but she did an amazing job and made it to where we will for sure be back  she gave clues when we needed them and took charge like a natural leader when the room went down. All and all we had an amazing fun experience and we will be back. DJ keep your head up kid you did awesome and made our time there awesome. Someone give this kid a raise she deserves it.
