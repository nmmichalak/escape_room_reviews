"Escape room ""High Voltage"" by Escape Room Salem in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-room-salem-the-outbreak,0,This place was by far the best room we've played. The puzzles were challenging but fun and the lab area was a blast. Definitely high tech but not over our heads. Rooms were nice and big compared to others we have done.
"Escape room ""High Voltage"" by Escape Room Salem in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-room-salem-the-outbreak,1,Took my 7 and 10-year-old kids for a birthday party. We had four adults in addition. The kids love finding clues and figuring out how to escape. They did not like the guy in the corner (mannequin) who was infected by the virus though. The adults all want to come back to do the next room. Would definitely recommend.

I'm 31 as was my guest and we were in a random group of 10 with much younger people (possible teenage or early college students). The room is quite small and people can be rude and/or immature - grabbing onto a vital piece of the puzzle before you can get a chance to look. The mystery itself was alright - this was my first escape room and although it wasn't the best experience, it was interesting enough. My biggest suggestion is to do this with people you know."

We did the Outbreak and the room was well decorated but the puzzles were terrible. Frequently we found the key without figuring out the puzzle. There was no flow to the rooms. And when we tried to figure out the puzzles, they didn't make any sense. Never again."
"Escape room ""High Voltage"" by Escape Room Salem in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-room-salem-the-outbreak,4,Great fun! My daughter was the star figuring out half of the puzzles. We did the Outbreak room and it was lots of fun. Saved the world from zombie apocalypse with 12 minutes to spare.

We did the Outbreak room and got out with just 4 seconds to spare. Paul took care of us and did an awesome job! Highly recommend. I wish I was in town for another day we would have done the Dracula room!
