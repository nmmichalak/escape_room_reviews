"Escape room ""The Hangover"" by Escape the Place in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escape-chambers-the-hangover,0,"We had a blast! A group of us were on a get away for the weekend, and we thought we would try it out for something new and different to do. We did The Hangover Room. The puzzles were tricky but achievable. We were glad to have the option to get a hint if needed...we needed. We will definitely be back to try another one! Fun, fun!!"
