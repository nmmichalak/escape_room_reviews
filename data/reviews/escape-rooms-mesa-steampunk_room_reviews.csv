"Escape room ""Steampunk"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-steampunk,0,Terrible experience with my family. The owner/manager was very rude.. I recommend to go elsewhere. Too many escape rooms to be treated like that. They don't set the rooms back up properly either.. if you want to spend a lot of money to be stressed and cursed out be my guest. If you want to have a good experienced don't go to Mesa escape rooms

Great experience every time! We especially enjoyed Steampunk and Outbreak! They put so much effort into their rooms. You truly felt the experience. These rooms are not just lock and key. Great puzzles, and a decent amount of tech. So many other escape houses could learn a thing or two from this place.Worth every penny! You won't regret it"

My friends and I have done several rooms and have never been disappointed. We keep coming back and they keep making new rooms! The latest one we did was Steampunk- the room was super cool! We had a blast!

The Steampunk Room was well thought out and had some interesting puzzles. The only drawback was a couple of the puzzles had very small writing and that writing was in shadow, it made them difficult to read, thus solve.  The staff was friendly and helpful."
