"Escape room ""Room 13"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-room-13,5,"My wife and I had went to breakout KC with friends a couple weeks ago and had a GREAT experience. I brought it up to my boss to see if we could take all of us managers to do a team building experience. We first tried the escape room and loved it. I took my boss tonight to Breakout KC because I had been bragging about how much fun it was and wanted to show her. We paid $28.00 per person, for Room 13. We thought it would just be us three but when we got there, we were told that a new hire was going to be going our team so he can get used to the rooms because that's how they do their training. We were 100% fine with that however, me my wife and my boss hardly were able to do anything because the ""new hire"" wouldn't let us. Every opinion we had, he said oh that can't be it. We literally stood in the room watching him play the game. At the end of the game, we were walked through how to breakout and all the answers we had told this guy what they were, were correct. He completely wasted our time and our money. When we left, I called and spoke to Cass and stressed our concerns because we were wanting to bring our employees there. This would have been GREAT business for them! She apologized and made a few phone calls and called me back and gave my wife, myself and my boss a free room. I wanted to say thank you to Cass because that is what I call a 5 star Customer Service. We were hoping to leave breakout KC laughing and smiling, and ended up leaving upset. I appreciate what you have done for us Cass and we will definitely be back to try another room. Thank you Breakout KC."
