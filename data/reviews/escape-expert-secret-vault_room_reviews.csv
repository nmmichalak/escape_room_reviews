"Escape room ""Secret Vault"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-secret-vault,0,"This is one of the worst escape rooms in DFW, at one of the worst companies in DFW. If you like locks and nonsensical puzzle flow this is the place for you! "

"Escape room ""Secret Vault"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-secret-vault,5,"My wife, our family, and our friends have been twice, and I can assure you we will go again to try more rooms! We have failed once and passed once, but had an amazing time both visits. The puzzles are tough, but solvable, and the experience leaves you and your fellow escapists talking about the rooms for days afterward (especially if you don't get out in time). I would recommend anyone to visit this place and give it a shot. It's an absolute blast!!!"
"Escape room ""Secret Vault"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-secret-vault,6,This was such a great experience. Went on a date night with my cousins & our beaus (and made some new friends). First your signed in and then given details on rules of the room. Then they escort you to the room and that's where the escape begins. The room was a little overwhelming at first but such a great way to think & use your mind. We had such a great time and we finished the room with less than 4 minutes to spare. Well definitely be back again to try another room
"Escape room ""Secret Vault"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-secret-vault,7,My husband and I had so much fun! We were the only two in the time slot we had originally booked. The lady called me a couple hours before asking if we would like to change the time so we could have a larger group. We did and we're happy we did so. We escaped with less than a minute remaining. We would never have escaped if it were just the two of us. We also had originally booked the attick. The lady recommended we switch to the secret vault since it was just four of us. It is a harder room but better for less people since the attick has things that will keep 8 people busy the entire time. We had so much fun! I can't wait to go back and try to escape the rest of the rooms!
