"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,0,"Fyi to set expectations, my friends and I have done several dozen escape rooms. Not sure experts but not new to the scene either. We loved the puzzles. They were refreshing compared to some of the overused ones we've seen. They did an EXCELLENT job with the startup tech theme. Lots of jokes that techies are sure to love. But if you're not from the startup world, you'll still be able to enjoy the puzzles and story without feeling lost. Great for group sizes 5-8. The first few puzzles are a little linear to get everyone warmed up, but the following ones can be parallelized so everyone's working on something and not feeling bottlenecked. Definitely would recommend!"

"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,2,"With such a market saturation of Escape Rooms, it was really refreshing to find one that cultivates such innovation. The concept of launching your startup and a set amount of money is such a nice change of pace from the generic murder or end of world scenarios that seem to dominate the landscape. Thought this balanced difficulty and entertainment extremely well, and look forward to seeing more from the creator down the road!"
