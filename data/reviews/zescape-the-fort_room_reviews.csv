"Escape room ""The Fort"" by Urban Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/zescape-the-fort,0,My family and I love doing escape rooms. We hadn't tried this one until December 2019 and man we can't wait to go back. We have done the Candy room which was hard but omg so much fun. We had to go back and try The Fort. WOW! Amazing experience. We also took our daughter who loved hers and is now hooked as well. We have more to do and can't wait to go back. Great for friends night out or if family comes to town. Totally need at least 4 people to do.

We did the Cells and the Fort, and really enjoyed both. The staff was professional and friendly, and also super attentive during the escapes. This has made the difference between ok/poor rooms and good ones: The people! Great job Urban Escape games, and weâ€™ll be back for more."

The host gave hilarious tips and encouragement. We will definitely recommend and will go again!"
