"Escape room ""Insane Asylum II"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-insane-asylum-2,0,"The Insane Asylum is their hardest room - we were told that only 1 group in 9 makes it out. With a few last-minute hints from our very helpful host through the provided walkie-talkie, we were able to escape! The room was pretty creepy, as you'd expect a good insane asylum themed room to be. We love PanIQ and will be coming back sometime to attempt their third room!"

The ambiance in there is actually pretty scary with a track playing screams the whole time. But it was still a lot of fun and honestly, we would go back to try and escape the ""Insane Asylum"" again."
