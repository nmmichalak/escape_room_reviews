"Escape room ""The Lost Wand"" by Puzzled Escape Games in Easthampton",https://worldofescapes.com/easthampton/quests/puzzled-escape-games-the-lost-wand,0,"I really enjoyed this room, Wizard themed. Once again, this escape was completely different from their others with a variety of clever and fun puzzles that cater to different peoples strengths in the group. Oh, and there is an actor in the room with you. They stayed in character the whole time and were there to help when needed. I don't want to give away anything but they have a lot of tech in this room and some things I've never seen or even heard of. The set design is pretty damn awesome, I'm so used playing in smaller escape rooms with low ceilings, that its just extra impressive to play in a room with 15 foot high walls. I found out that they have a Kids version of this adventure which I can totally see."
