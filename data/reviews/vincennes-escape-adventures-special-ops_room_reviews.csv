"Escape room ""Special Ops - The Hunt for Kore Anne"" by Vincennes Escape Adventures in Vincennes",https://worldofescapes.com/vincennes/quests/vincennes-escape-adventures-special-ops,0,"This was beyond worth the money. I went in expecting it to be a breeze, but with all the twists, turns, and crazy ideas to go along with the plot, it really puts it into perspective. Really great story telling and really great staff. Will be back, with a different crew! You guys were beyond awesome."
