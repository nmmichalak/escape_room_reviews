Clues were great. Definitely put our 6 brains to work! Had to have a few assists, but made it out before our time was up! We will definitely be back for another round!!"
"Escape room ""Nate's Motel"" by Fantasy Escapes in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/fantasy-escapes-nates-motel,1,The family and I had a great time!! We did Nate’s Motel. The puzzles were challenging and enjoyable. They encouraged us to combine our forces into working together!! We made it out with 8 minutes and 23 seconds to spare!! We went for our youngest’ birthday and will be back to challenge us again soon!!

It was very creative, challenging, and just the right amount of creepy that we wanted. We loved that our game master watched us and didn't give us clues until he knew that we REALLY needed them. His name was Caleb and he was fantastic!! We can't wait to check out the other rooms!"
