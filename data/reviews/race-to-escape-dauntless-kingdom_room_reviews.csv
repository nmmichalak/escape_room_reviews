I was totally impressed with the quality of and imagination built into the puzzles. While challenging, they were solvable and very creative! The price is very fair, the decor is professionally done, the staff is friendly and supportive and the experience is something you'll not soon forget. We will come back and do another room soon. Thank you Race to Escape."
