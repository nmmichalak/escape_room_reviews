"Escape room ""Curiouser and Curiouser: Escape from Wonderland"" by Family Fun Escape Rooms in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/family-fun-escape-rooms-curiouser-and-curiouser-escape-from-wonderland,0,"Kristina was super sweet and so nice!!! Made my parents (first time escape roomers) so comfortable and at ease. We ended up choosing the Alice in Wonderland room and thought we had chosen the medium level (cause we didn't believe in ourselves), but turns out the owner and Kristina changed our level of difficulty to hard after having a conversation with us and ""reading"" us because they believed we'd be good at hard! Turns out it was so much fun but challenging at the same time. We escaped with 16 mins left over! I would def recommend this place as a family friendly escape room, but don't be fooled it's challenging and makes adults think too! This place is very well kept, and you can tell a lot of thought and work has gone behind even creating all the rooms and clues. Will def be back here again!!"

It was challenging, yet obtainable and the hour went by so fast. If you are a riddle or puzzle lover you will absolutely love this experience. We did the Alice and Wonderland theme. The room was decorated with all the whimsical wonders."

We are both over 60 and had a great time. These rooms are exactly what they say-""Family Fun"". They are great for kids, teens, adults, and seniors, and any mixture thereof. Birthday parties, family fun night, etc. The decor and props are great. Christina was our gamemaster and did an excellent job. (Thx, Christina!) I would recommend this business to locals and visitors alike. I know we will be back when I visit again!"
