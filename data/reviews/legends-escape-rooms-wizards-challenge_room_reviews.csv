"Escape room ""Wizard's Challenge"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-wizards-challenge,0,It was a challenge to get thru the room. It's best to have lots of people in your group to have all minds come together in order to escape. It's definitely worth the money so if your up for a challenge then this is the place to go and have fun
"Escape room ""Wizard's Challenge"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-wizards-challenge,1,"We experienced ""Wizard's Challenge"" - I went in hoping it wouldn't be too overwhelming for our group of four, which included my parents who had NEVER done any kind of escape room before... but love dragons and wizards, so we had to try it! The decor, sound effects and overall ambiance was perfect. The puzzles were challenging and fit 110% with the theme of the room! Sydney was our game host and was excellent! Clues were just right and when it was more of a technical adjustment rather than an incorrect answer, she was an amazing guide to ""tweaking it to make it right"". Our family had an awesome time and my mother (visiting from California) already wants Legends Escape Room on her ""Must Do"" for next time! If you are a Harry Potter fan, love wizards and dragons or just looking for an escape room ""different"" than the usual locks - try ""Wizard's Challenge"" for an A+ experience!"
"Escape room ""Wizard's Challenge"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-wizards-challenge,2,We had a blast and was excited how far we got for our first visit. We will go again. Staff was fabulous and was very patient with newbies. We did the Wizard room. It was tough but as time went by it was exciting to find the clues to race against time. Totally recommend to any family for a fun night.
