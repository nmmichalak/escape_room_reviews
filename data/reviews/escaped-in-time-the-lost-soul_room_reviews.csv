"Escape room ""The Lost Soul"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-the-lost-soul,0,"Our group has done a few escape rooms before. We did The Lost Soul room and it was pretty fantastic - very immersive, which is what we want from an escape room. The decor was spot on, down to the scent of the rooms. It wasn’t the hardest escape room we’ve encountered, but it definitely wasn’t easy by any means. We are looking forward to trying our hand at the We’re All Mad Here room fairly soon. Highly recommend Escaped in Time!"

We have done a number of escape rooms in Colorado and South Dakota, and this has been our favorite thus far. The staff is especially friendly and fun. The puzzles were well thought out and challenging. We escaped from the Lost Souls room which was very well put together and created an authentic experience.This is a well-run establishment that is guaranteed to provide a fun time for anyone who visits. We are definitely going back to try to escape from the other rooms that are offered."
"Escape room ""The Lost Soul"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-the-lost-soul,3,Friendly staff and lots of fun! We did the pirate theme and were so close to figuring out the last clue. But the staff came in after our time was up and didn’t make us leave right away. They helped us through the last clue to figure out how to escape. It was a great experience.
