"Escape room ""Baker Street"" by Escape Room Missouri City in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-room-missouri-city-baker-street,0,"It was the perfect family activity, and all of us, ages 9 to 55 worked together and had a great time! It's not easy, and thankfully our game master was perfect, and we managed to escape with seconds to spare. We can't wait to do it again soon!"

The room was supposed to be one of the harder rooms and realizing that there's only three of us, our game master was helpful and we solved our room right when the time ran out. The puzzles and clues were really intricate. Escape Room Games really did a lot of planning and made the rooms fun and interesting. The hour goes by fast but definitely doable. I strongly suggest going to this place!"

I called ahead and asked if they take walk-ins and they do! My group and I did Baker Street, which is apparently one of the harder rooms they have. Since my group only had three people and we were doing a hard room, our game master gave us hints without giving too much away. He communicated with us through a tv screen that was mounted on the wall. The timer was also shown on there. It was challenging, but fun!The place itself is clean. The staff there were super friendly and accommodating! The price is reasonable: $25 per person. It's definitely worth it for the hour you are there. I highly recommend this place."
