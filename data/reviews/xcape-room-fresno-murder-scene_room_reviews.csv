"Escape room ""Murder Scene 2.0"" by Xcape Room Fresno in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/xcape-room-fresno-murder-scene,0,This place was soooooooooo cool! I went here for my birthday with my sisters and bf we had so much fun! We range in age from 15-27 and everyone was an asset in different areas of finding clues which was cool to see. It's definitely something I would do again. We did the Murder room and it was HARD but I loved it! I want to try the bunker room and the temple which is their newest room. The staff is really good at making this a good experience.

It was AMAZING. The staff was very nice friendly, the environment was excellent and puzzles were very cool. The puzzles were challenging and definitely required thought, but not so difficult that it caused frustration. We did the Murder Scene room and even though we didn't get out in the time, tonight's experience would definitely encourage me to recommend it to my friends and go back to try again. Thank you Xcape Room for an awesome experience!!"
