"Escape room ""Skinner's Box"" by Murfreesboro Escape Room in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/murfreesboro-escape-rooms-skinners-box,0,"The quality and theme are fun, but the mechanics didn't work for us when we visited.  One of our team got out of their room because of a tool left behind by the game master and twice when we unlocked something that something never fell and the game master had to come in to give us our next clue.  There are much better production value games in Murfreesboro, but if everything worked like it should, I guess I would recommend this one. "

Our group had 6 people (relatives age 14 to 40+).  It was the first escape rooms type outing for five of us. We were paired with another family of four for the maximum of 10 people that can use this room at once. The host/staff were fun and polite.  The room was a real challenge. The hour flew by!  In the end, we escaped with about 3 minutes to spare.  We couldn't stop talking about it on the way home and plan to try another room soon. I highly recommend Murfreesboro Escape Rooms for a family outing or team building exercise."
