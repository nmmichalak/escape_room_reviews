"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes' Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-great-escape-room-chicago-sherlock,0,"We did the Sherlock Holmes Library and the puzzles were a decent level of difficulty - would have been better if we'd had more than 4 people though especially for the scavenger hunt part of it.I have to be honest though I wasn't a huge fan of having a ""guide"" in the room with you - I've done an escape room previous where we had to figure it all out ourselves and I think our guide gave too much away.Overall a good experience, but if I go again I'll ask for no guide."

One of the best room escapes I've done to date. The location was awesome and made it that much cooler. If I'm in Chicago again, I'll be back for the new rooms."
