"Escape room ""Deadbeard's Revenge"" by Ninja Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/ninja-escape-captain-deadbeards-revenge,0,We were a group of 8 and had booked the entire mission. We did end up solving it and we had a blast! Our mission support was Dan and he was the MAN! His instructions were clear and his timely clues/hints helped make this awesome experience even better. We look forward to going back again and experiencing the other escape rooms that they have.

They loved it! They did the Captain Deadbeard's Revenge room. They weren't able to solve all the puzzles but had a great time anyway! Jake was fantastic! Handled the kids like a bawse!
