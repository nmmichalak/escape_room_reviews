Our group was warmly greeted by the staff, given thorough instructions and sent on our way. We were given an hour to complete the challenge and we almost made it in time... After we were done the staff came in to congratulate us on finishing the challenge and we took pictures and chatted with the staff for a bit. I look forward to returning when there are new challenges and will be sharing this with all my friends! Thank you for a fun evening!"

The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. The theme of the room was hilarious and entertaining, and the puzzles all made sense. It's great to finally have a local escape room that's easy to get to."
