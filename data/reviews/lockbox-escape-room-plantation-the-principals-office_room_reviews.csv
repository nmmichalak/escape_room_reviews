"Escape room ""The Principal’s Office"" by Lockbox Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/lockbox-escape-room-plantation-the-principals-office,2,We had a great time on a rainy day. It was 2 families of 4 doing the Principal's Office escape. We had 2 girls age 8 & 10 and the other family had a 10yo and 12yo. We all worked together and the kids had a great time. We used a few hints but finished with 5 minutes to spare. We will definitly do another room in the future.
