"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-cuban-crisis,0,"My husband and I tried this location for the first time last night and we loved it. The lounge is beautiful and clean, the team members Kevin and Joey are super friendly and great and of course the room was super well put together. We did the Cuban Crisis and even though we didn't escape in time we had so much fun! We are 100% going to return to try all of the rooms here. Can't wait to go again soon!"
"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-cuban-crisis,1,This was my first time at an escape room. Tyler was the most amazing attendant at Escapology! We had a party of 5 and he made the experience unforgettable!!! So much so I'm going back with my husband.
"Escape room ""Cuban Crisis"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-cuban-crisis,2,My team of 4 are escape room junkies. We visited Escapology yesterday and absolutely loved it. We did both Budapest and Cuban Crisis. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the puzzles were well themed to fit the room. The game was challenging enough for experienced escape masters but not too challenging for newbies. Francesca took care of us for the most part during our visit and she was exceptional. I highly recommend this venue.
