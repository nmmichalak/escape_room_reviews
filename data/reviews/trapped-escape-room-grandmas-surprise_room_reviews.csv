"Escape room ""Grandma's Surprise"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapped-escape-room-grandmas-surprise,0,My office team tried out the grandma room yesterday. So much fun. Roland was great and all my employees liked the experience. We had to work together to get through the many puzzles. It was neat to see who took the lead on certain tasks and who helped put the right people in the spots working each task. We got out by the skin of our teeth.

One of the best things about this room was it is only your group.  If you don't fill all of the spots, you don't have to play with people you don't know.  Nice clean place with nice staff.  We really liked it!"

This was my first escape room, and let me say it was awesome. We had a party of five which seemed like a good number of people to solve all of puzzles to complete the mission. The room was a challenge and the hints helped out a ton! Dream our hostess and helper was amazing, will definitely try the other puzzle soon. Cannot recommend this place enough and location was close to home:) Thanks again!!"
