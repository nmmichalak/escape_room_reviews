"Escape room ""The Dark Experiment"" by Escapologist in Lawton",https://worldofescapes.com/lawton/quests/escapologist-the-dark-experiment,0,"My wife and I had a fantastic experience in the newest room “the dark experiment”. Excellent way to have fun and work on problem solving with friends. I would recommend bringing some friends and trying to beat the fastest times. The problem sets are tough but not to the point of frustration, and the added scare factors in the new room just improve the overall experience."
