"Escape room ""Inception"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-inception,0,The staff was nice and funny even though my party was 15 minutes late. The Inception escape room was tough but our group of 8 had a blast. We highly recommend this place!
"Escape room ""Inception"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-inception,1,"**NON-SPOILER REVIEW** This is only my second escape room and was the first for the other 5 friends I did this with. I chose this one over the other because the premise seemed more technical and the other room was rated as scary, which was a no-go for one of our members. The puzzles were very technical in nature rather than relying heavily on math or word puzzles, which was a huge positive for the room as it fit the theme and every time we solved one we were blown away with the amount of technology that had to have gone into creating the puzzle. Comparing this to my first escape room experience, this escape was far more satisfying and we all can't stop talking about each puzzle and the creativity behind them. I can't wait to try out future rooms that they have in construction."
"Escape room ""Inception"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-inception,2,"My sister in law was in town for her birthday and we decided, spur of the moment, to do an escape room. I wanted to do the inception room because it was rated harder than their other room. The puzzles were a fun mix of physical and more traditional. Some of the physical puzzles were difficult for our group, but I expect that if you or someone in your group is more of a spacial thinker then you probably won't have the problems we did.Inception is a rather tech heavy room, which often feels gimmicky to me. However in the Inception room they used the tech to their advantage really well. It fits the theme and feel of the room superbly.Overall, Inception is an excellent room and is one of the few rooms I've done that actually gets better in my mind the more I analyze it."
