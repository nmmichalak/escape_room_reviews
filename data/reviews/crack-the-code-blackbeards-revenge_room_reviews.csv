We played Blackbeard Revenge at Crack the Code. It was exactly what we look for in escape rooms. We were greeted by the owner, who was very welcoming and friendly. The room was well decorated and the puzzles were challenging and entertaining!! We would recommend this place to anyone and cannot wait to visit them for their new room!"

The theme of the escape room was also well captured and made you feel like you were in Blackbeard's quarters. The owners were very welcoming and knowledgeable about escape rooms. We will be back for sure!"
