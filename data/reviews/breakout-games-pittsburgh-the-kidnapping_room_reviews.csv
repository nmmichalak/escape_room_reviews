"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-the-kidnapping,0,This was a lot of fun! We did the Kidnapping - you are blindfolded and handcuffed to start. It wasn't scary though. Very fun!

We made it out with 3 minutes to spare. When we arrived, I wasn't sure what to make of the place. We sat in the waiting room for a few minutes when Joe, the manager, came out and introduced himself. He was so full of enthusiasm and was very friendly the whole time. The experience would have been good if it were just the room, but Joe made the experience into a great one! We needed a few hints and he helped us along the way. It was such a fun time. 5/5 for sure and I'll definitely be back."

He knew when and how to say stuff without making it too easy, just to make our brain wheels turn. We will definitely be back to do other rooms in the future. They are a little more pricey but it's worth it to be guaranteed for a private room. Tons of fun ! Thank you! This was our 9th escape room total, and we had one person doing their first room with us"
