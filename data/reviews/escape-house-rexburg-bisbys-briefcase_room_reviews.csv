"Escape room ""The Locker Room - Bisby's Briefcase"" by Escape House in Rexburg",https://worldofescapes.com/rexburg/quests/escape-house-rexburg-bisbys-briefcase,0,"Brisby's Briefcase was a really fun room and had some neat and original clues. Don't worry about getting confused with clues from the other game, ""Pedro's drug problem,"" they are swapped out of the room so there is only one set of clues."
