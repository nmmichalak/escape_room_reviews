Most others we’ve been to use Bookeo where it’s really easy to tell the max number of spots available and how many have been booked. As a result we weren’t totally clear on max number of people etc. It was on the website had I read a little more closely and that was 100% my fault but in the moment I was frustrated. So when we got there we were disappointed to learn that other people had also booked the room also so we’d have to do it with strangers which to me is a deal breaker. So... fortunately prior to the other people who had booked the room arriving, the owner happened to be there and came over and talked to us. She explained that a private booking option on the site was clearly and prominently posted and then offered an option that resolved my concerns. I won’t go into details to prevent people from trying to take advantage of her goodwill but suffice to say we ended up doing The Villains Lair and although theme-wise it didn’t sound that appealing to me, it was actually fantastic!We loved the mix of great clues, combination, keyed, and electronic locks, and most importantly: it was CLEAN and well CLIMATE CONTROLLED. So many escape rooms get stuffy after a while because the buildings they’re in weren’t necessarily designed for the extra walled off spaces, but this place was perfect. We’ve done rooms at Mastermind STL and Breakout KC and COMO which are pretty polished. This place is the brain child of the husband and wife owners and they did a great job creating a perfectly functional, immersive, professionally designed environment that we thoroughly enjoyed. We’ve done other escape rooms that were amateur and terrible. These folks are definitely pros. Highly recommend!!"

The waiting room has a lot of small challenging puzzles for before the game began. In the games, the puzzles were unique and fun. Our group faced a few challenges, having to draw on different strengths on the team. The staff were just delightful. Very engaging and helpful. Great location. Plenty of parking. We look forward to playing the holiday room when it opens."
