"Escape room ""Pele’s Stone Room"" by Submerged Maui in Maui",https://worldofescapes.com/lahaina/quests/submerged-maui-peles-stone-room,1,"My family and I have been to various escape rooms in many different states in the U.S. (at least 10), including one in Wailuku on Maui. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ""ESCAPE ROOM.""   The best escape for you is to escape the temptation to spend any time or money at this location.  The price of $50 pp is you paying for their rent at the Wailea Beach Resort.  Go to Ramen Shop escape room at Mystery Maui.  The Submerged Maui room had some potential and some cool elements but it is clear that they don't know how to properly organize, run and facilitate a successful escape room. Overall, they had a unique concept (i.e. submarine, laser beams, etc.), but unfortunately their clues were shouted through the walls or delivered in person, which we found was extremely unprofessional. Also, the rooms were very dark, not to mention the countdown clock was only present in the briefing room. Sorry to write such a bad review but I wouldn't suggest choosing this particular escape room (especially at that cost)."
