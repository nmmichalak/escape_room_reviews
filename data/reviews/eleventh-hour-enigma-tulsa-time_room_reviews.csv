This place has quality puzzles and they didn't miss a detail when it came to interior design. We have already booked the Winchester Room.

We’ve been to a handful of escape rooms and loved the detail as well as the fun, challenging innovative puzzles. They were very creative and the difficulty felt just right. Look forward to the new rooms when they open. We plan on checking them out."
