It was our first time doing an escape room and we had no idea what to expect. As our luck would have it, we picked the most difficult room of course. Yes it was very difficult but the clues really helped! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had a great time and would definitely recommend it!"

Almost made it. I think we should have tried an easier room first... just to get the hang of it. Really fun evening though and I would go again!"

This time we did the magicians room. And we made it out! Everyone is polite ans very helpful. My friend who was there was a little nervous and they patiently helped her feel comfortable. I want to try the Serial Killer room next.
