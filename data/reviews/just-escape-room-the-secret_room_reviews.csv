"Escape room ""The Secret"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-the-secret,0,"I went with a group of five people (including myself) in late January 2018 to tackle ""The Secret"". We were combined with a family of three and had a great time! My group was composed of people who have done a lot of escape rooms and the family were doing it for the first time, but it proved to be the perfect level of difficulty for everyone. There were a variety of puzzles ranging in difficulty, using various forms of mediums. I loved how the types of clues and solutions were different than a lot of escape rooms that I've been to, and how while challenging it was never so much so that one became so frustrated it was no longer fun. Through great team work and communication (and a couple of clues), we were able to make it out in time!I'd definitely recommend this company, and my friends and I definitely plan on coming back to try the other room."

Many in the group had not done one before and the secret was a great place to start.  All had a great time - Mike was just the right amount of helpful and also letting them problem solve on their own.

It challenged us in fun ways and we worked together to escape in 50 minutes. So creative, so professional, so awesome! We all loved it and can't wait to do another. Great price, friendly, flexible and helpful staff, clean, welcoming  and professional facility and very easy parking. Thank you Just Escape Room for such a fun family event."
