Man, that was so much fun! We made it out in time, which we are all proud of! I am definitely going to try to come back with my family to try this out with them."
"Escape room ""The Gallery"" by NC Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/nc-escape-the-gallery,2,This place is awesome. This was our first time doing an escape room and I can't wait till next time. We completed the Gallery in 53 minutes with four people. Next time I want to try Ex Machina. I will bring my 15-year-old son next time. He will love it!
