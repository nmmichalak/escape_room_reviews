"Escape room ""Dracula"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-dracula,0,"I loved *other* 60Out rooms, but didn't enjoy this one even though we escaped. This was my 36th room I've escaped, and a lot of the puzzles didn't seem super logical. So when you find two components of a puzzle, it's not clear that they go together, let alone how to use them. We were a bit disappointed that the game masters gave us hints that we didn't ask for, but they were just trying to make sure we maintain a good pace in order to escape the room."

"Escape room ""Dracula"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-dracula,3,The Dracula room was great. It's  definitely on the hard side as the room has great puzzles that involve every aspect of the room. Gamemaster Valerie was very helpful. She gave us hints when we needed it. Overall we had a great time.

We've done Grandma's Masterplan, Dracula, and Alice in Wonderland! All rooms are fantastic and the puzzles make you think in a different and new way. Of course, the sets are always amazing and it is a big part of the appeal. Love it when I get fully immersed in the theme!"
