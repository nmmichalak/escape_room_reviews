"Escape room ""The Dueling Room: FBI vs CIA"" by IRL Escape in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/irl-escape-the-dueling-room,0,"One of my favorite escape room experiences! You have to try the dueling rooms, the competition and pressure are up and such a cool concept to compete against the other room. The WWII room was also epic with some interesting historical facts very smoothly utilized. Love this place!! Can't wait for more rooms :)"
"Escape room ""The Dueling Room: FBI vs CIA"" by IRL Escape in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/irl-escape-the-dueling-room,1,We had a team outing where the 12 of us went head to head in the FBI vs. CIA rooms. The competition was very fun and the puzzles were challenging and encouraged teamwork. I would highly recommend IRL to whoever is looking for a good time as a large or small group. Thanks again Anthony for a great time.

Doing the FBI vs. CIA rooms with a larger group was a fun and novel competition. It could have been a little more challenging, but the competition against another part of our group kept everybody competitive. Owners were fantastic as well."

Our group did the Dueling Rooms which were FBI/CIA themed. We all had a blast and I know that personally, my team will be coming back again very soon!"
