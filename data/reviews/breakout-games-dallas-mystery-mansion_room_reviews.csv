We had so much fun and the challenges were hard but not impossible. The staff was extremely friendly and willing to work with us to make the experience exactly what we wanted. I highly recommend them!"

We went with 8 people in all, and there was a lot to do, but it would have been about the same if we only had 4.There were a few times that I didn't get the logical connection from one clue to another, but it didn't hurt the experience."

We were very impressed. I did this with just my husband- the two of us. We managed to get out with 10 minutes to spare from the Mystery Mansion. We had a wonderful game master, Mary. I recommend this escape room! Just a note though- it's in the Parks Mall. So if you don't want others to join your room, you might have to buy out the room or book last minute. There could be walk-ups added to your room."
