"Escape room ""Special Inquiry"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-special-inquiry,0,"Our group did the ""Special Inquiry"" of 6 people. It was a surprise. The room is actually really hard for someone like us who never played escape room before. We do have to think differently in here compare to the real world. Also alert to all of you. This room is hell scary!!! Nothing jump out. I think the guy who built this room was genius."
"Escape room ""Special Inquiry"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-special-inquiry,1,"Came here on a whim. Never did an escape room before. This place was a little tricky to find. It's upstairs of the building so head inside.Before we go into the room, we watch a screen with rules and the backstory of the escape room. Then we get a walker talkie in case they need to talk us or if we want to ask for a hint. There are cameras in the rooms for them to watch to make sure you follow the rules. We might have been reminded about some rules....We did the special inquiry escape room. Since it was the first I've ever been to it took a little bit to figure out what needed to be done in there. It was pretty fun and it did get a little creepy. We didn't make it out... but it has inspired us to try another escape room."
