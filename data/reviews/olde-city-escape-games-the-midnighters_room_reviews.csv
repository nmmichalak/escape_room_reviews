"Escape room ""The Midnighters"" by Olde City Escape Games in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/olde-city-escape-games-the-midnighters,0,excellent games....we did the midnighters and then went back to the quest. Both games are great but Midnighters was my personal favorite. We were 8 people and everyone had a blast. We've done a few escape games and these were top notch.

It was a blast. They were very different, but both challenging. Some surprising and cool elements. "

And great experience going to this escape room on my birthday with family and friends. Not very difficult, not very easy either. The Midnighters was fairly at a normal level settings. Me and my group escaped with 12 minutes to spare. Highly recommend this room!"
