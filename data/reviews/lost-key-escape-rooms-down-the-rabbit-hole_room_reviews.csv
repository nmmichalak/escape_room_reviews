"Escape room ""Down The Rabbit Hole"" by Lost Key Escape Rooms in Lewiston",https://worldofescapes.com/lewiston/quests/lost-key-escape-rooms-down-the-rabbit-hole,0,The new Down the Rabbit Hole theme is great! We had a group of young teens (12 of them) 12-15 go through and successfully completed the puzzles. They said it was a lot of fun. Not too difficult but still challenging. Kristin and Kelcie are great hosts! Wonderful entertainment option for our area!
