We did Brandon's room. Loved the throw backs from the 80s. Felt it could have used more decor, but we werent really sure where to look or get started for that matter so I guess it all worked out. We didnt get out in time due to some math issues of our own, but we had a lot of fun and want to go back and try the other rooms."

Kiera was such a great host, and was there at every turn if we needed a clue to get us moving! Brandon's room was laid out well and definitely gets you thinking. It will keep you on your toes. Make sure to look at everything in the room, everything plays a part in helping you solve it! Great way to spend time with friends, and spend the night out!"
