"Escape room ""Shadow Manor"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/memphis-escape-rooms-shadow-manor,0,"Very well designed room. Spooky element was balanced well. I would not recommend for small children as there are some rather macabe elements, and 1 potentially very frightening moment for kids under age of 10."
