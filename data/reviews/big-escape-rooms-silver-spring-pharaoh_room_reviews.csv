We were trying out a new room, so there were a few things that didn't go as planned. It was challenging, but we finished with 3 minutes to spare yay! Brian was very helpful."

We tried the newest room and although it had the kinks, it was a lot of fun and we still succeeded! I can't wait to try another room here. I highly recommend it. Brian was a great help for the clues to the room and loves our input.I'll be back soon!"

We did the Pharaoh room and it was quite challenging but rewarding! Will be coming back!"
