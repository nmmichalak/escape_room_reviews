"Escape room ""Ole Pappy's Trapper Cabin"" by NW Escape on Wheels in Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/bend/quests/nw-escape-on-wheels-ole-pappys-trapper-cabin,0,So excited to find out about escape rooms and even more excited that Ole Pappy's Trapper Cabin was my first experience.  My family went as a group and and such a great time.  I would highly recommend giving Nwescapeonwheels a try!
"Escape room ""Ole Pappy's Trapper Cabin"" by NW Escape on Wheels in Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/bend/quests/nw-escape-on-wheels-ole-pappys-trapper-cabin,1,"I took my fianc√© on day trip to Bend for his birthday, Ol' Pappy's Trapper Cabin was the cherry on top of an unforgettable day.Booking our visit was super easy- It was nice to be able to text Ky, the owner, with any questions. I opted for an evening booking and was very happy for it- the cabin looks pretty spiffy at night.We visited the trailer at the box factory (the trailer can also come to visit you), it's a wonderful area in town with live music, breweries, and eats- so if you arrive early you'll have lots to do while you wait.It was great to be greeted by Ky (as Dobby, the not-so-bright kid who watches ol' pappy's cabin while he's out) we felt very welcome.When you step into the cabin you can see just how much hard work and dedication went in to the character of the place. The puzzles were engaging without being convoluted-- accessible, but also very tight. There are some fun surprises waiting for you snoopin' city folk.Ky also added some personal touches just for my partner's birthday, complete with a beer puzzle- he felt very special :)If you're still not convinced, take a look at Ky's website. There's no substitute for a business owner who loves what they do and the investment in the immersion is so delightful and makes all the difference.We left smiling!"
