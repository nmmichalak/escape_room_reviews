I've been wanting to try an Escape Room for a while now, and this exceeded the expectations I had! We tried ""The Study"" for our first experience since it's the ""easy"" room and it was our first time trying to escape. The puzzles and objective were AMAZING. It is such a brilliant game. I will definitely be telling my friends and I will definitely be going again! So much fun!"
"Escape room ""The Study"" by Exodus Escape Games in Columbus (GA)",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus-ga/quests/exodus-escape-games-the-study,2,My friend and I did The Study and The Revolution and escaped both!! Both rooms were super fun and challenging! Josh was an excellent Game Master and was very helpful in guiding us. We highly recommend Exodus if you're looking for a fun way to use your brain for an hour!!

My family, husband, and I were amazed by what the company has done in such a small space. It wasn't too easy and definitely challenged us. We can't wait for the new game/room being developed and will definitely be back!"

It was our first experience doing an escape room and we loved it! Josh (and the other employee) were so helpful and nice. They even allowed us extra time at the end since we didn't make it through and they didn't have another booking. You can tell Josh puts a lot of thought and time into planning, creating, and developing the concepts and clues. It was truly an awesome experience!!! This particular escape room is also in the nicer part of Columbus. We'll definitely be back with friends and family!"
