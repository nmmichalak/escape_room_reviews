"Escape room ""Meltdown"" by The Enigma Project in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/The-Enigma-Project-Meltdown,0,The Meltdown escape room was challenging but really fun. And of course the haunted house never disappoints. I have a hard time getting scared at haunted houses anymore but they got me to jump a few times. The decorations and acting are excellent. Highly recommend.
