"Escape room ""Mission Escapossible"" by Exitology Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/exitology-escape-room-mission-escapossible,0,"I think the owner really took a long time to think about the theme and all the details. There are two rooms right now and the third one is coming. The puzzles are both interesting and challenging. One puzzle is closely related to the next one. It is definitely a great place to have fun with friends, team building with colleagues."

The staff is very friendly and helpful. I went with my 11-year-old son and his friends. They had a great time. I enjoyed the storyline and solving the puzzles one after another! Definitely recommend to anyone looking for challenges and team building.
