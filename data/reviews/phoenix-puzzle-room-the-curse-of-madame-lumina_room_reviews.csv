Our game keeper was great, kept the game going, let us know when we were totally off on a wrong direction. We had a teen and a child with us, and I they had an awesome time too (make sure to check the policy on bringing kids under 15). Everyone was able to be involved and it was a fun time. And luckily we escaped the Madame Lumina Room!! Would definitely love to do this again!"

We played with a group of six, which seemed about right for the Madame Lumina room-- any more, it may have been a bit too chaotic for me anyway. But with six players, there seemed to be enough to do to keep us busy and keep the excitement building in the room. The game maker/runner did a good job at keeping us moving along and not letting us get stuck in futile searches. Overall great time!"
