I've been to most of the rooms in the DFW area and this is one of the top 3 for me. I did the Asylum and the puzzles were very unique and clever. Very satisfying solutions. And the theme and production quality were excellent! I will definitely be coming back to do the rest of the rooms here.

"Escape room ""Asylum 2.0"" by Twisted Key Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/twisted-key-escape-room-the-asylum,4,This place is amazing! We did the Asylum and they put a lot of effort into this room! It is not easy to get through but they also help you to make sure you don't get stuck in on stop for too long. One of the things I love about Twisted Key is that they let you finish the room even if your hour is up. I can't wait to go back and do the CSI Room!
