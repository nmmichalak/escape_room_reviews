"Escape room ""Scarlett's Room"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-SCARLETTS-ROOM,0,"Although we ended up as Scarlett's newest broken toys, we still had an absolute blast here and can't wait to come back to work our way through both chapters (and the third when it opens). This is one of the best attractions in Gatlinburg - if you haven't tried it yet, do it NOW! It's an adrenaline rush like no other!"
"Escape room ""Scarlett's Room"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-SCARLETTS-ROOM,1,This was the first escape room we had ever done and we’ve done many since then. None of them come close to this one. We did Scarlett’s room and it was amazing from the second we walked in! I don’t know if we’ll find another that will beat this one!
