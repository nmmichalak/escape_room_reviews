"Escape room ""The Chocolate Factory"" by Boss-Play Escape Rooms in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/boss-play-escape-rooms-the-chocolate-factory,0,"Having done more than 15 rooms, all of which with my cousins, I would say that Boss Play is one of the more impressive designed rooms. I was fortunate to try their new Chocolate Factory (already did their Prohibition room), and it was one of the most creative themed rooms I have seen.Jeremy, the owner, has done something that few escape room owners can say, which is that he built his rooms using no locks and keys. Therefore, you aren't looking for padlocks or combination locks to open, only to find another locked box. The electronics he uses for opening doors, solving riddles and special effects are second to none.Anyone in North County who hasn't done an escape room before, come to Boss Play first and try their Chocolate Factory room. It will set the standard to which you will compare all other future escape rooms you go to. For those who have already done escape rooms, Boss play is worth the trip."

I had a preference for the Willy Wonka one definitely. Great puzzles and design. Easy to find, easy parking. Very friendly! There is a cabinet to lock your purse in if needed and it even has phone chargers."

The game masters are friendly and helpful and help you get into the spirit of the room! They even recommended other escape rooms to us at the end."
