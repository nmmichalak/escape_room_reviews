"Escape room ""Amityville"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-amityville,2,"Amityville and Cartel - Silverlake locationOur first escape room experience in LA, and it was so much fun.  The difficulty level was perfect.  We started with Amityville, and although we needed a few clues along the way from Andrew (our GM), he was very careful not to make it too easy.  We had such a good time escaping Amityville, we stayed to escape the Cartel.  Location was easy to find.  Parking lot holds 4-5 cars/plenty of street parking.  No lockers, so anything you bring along comes with you into the rooms.  Nice clean bathrooms.  Filtered water in the lobby.  Both rooms are great for your first escape room experience or your first escape room as a team."
