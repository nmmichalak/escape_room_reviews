"Escape room ""Cursed - Egyptian Tomb"" by Portsmouth Team Building - Escape Rooms in Portsmouth",https://worldofescapes.com/portsmouth/quests/portsmouth-team-building-cursed-egyptian-tomb,0,Honestly the most unique and fun escape room I've ever done! We did the Egyptian escape room and it was less the paper and pencil solve the puzzle with colors than it was riddles and mysterious and really out of the box thinking. We barely made it out!

The room was really cool! So realistic! Challenging and lots of fun. We had lots of laughs too! Very entertaining! The staff was really friendly and welcoming! We look forward to trying the other rooms!
