"Escape room ""The Cure"" by Entrap Games in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/entrap-games-the-cure,0,"I went through the room The Cure and it was an amazing experience! Jessi, Lesa, and Sean were all so great and we're very understanding when my group bailed on me. The room was challenging but not impossible and had an awesome backstory. It made you feel like you were legit in that situation! I'm so excited to come back and do the rest of the rooms!"

We did the Cure Room with two adults and two kids. Although we didn't save the world in 60 minutes, we still had a BLAST! Next time we are in Wichita, we would love to try one of the other rooms. I'd recommend Entrap and encourage you to take the challenge!"
