"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-hostage,0,My wife and I visited our daughter and her fiancee in Minneapolis and they surprised us wife a visit to Breakout. Having never heard of Breakout but having heard of escape rooms we were all intrigued. Our daughter selected hostage. We didn't even come close to getting out and thank goodness for the advisor otherwise we would still be there. All in all a lot of fun and looking back would have liked the tropical one.

I played the ""Hostage"" room with some friends and had a great time. We broke out in just under an hour thanks to a few clues from Shelby who worked there. She did a great job and was super nice! The game had lots of cool features which made it challenging and really fun. Definitely worth it!"

Before the game, the guy helped us understand the rules well and we were then taken into the room blindfolded and handcuffed... I won't spoil any further details, as you need to go in and enjoy the same. We went with 7 people which I felt was a good number considering the place and the way clues need to be worked. WIll be back to try the other rooms."

Would do again. I have done the Island Escape and the Hostage rooms, both had their own challenges. The help received from the host was just what we needed at times. Can't wait to try another room soon."
