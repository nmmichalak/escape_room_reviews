Since the ticket price is significantly higher than most rooms, I was really counting on a positive experience. We played the Egypt room and had a great time with my three friends.We used 4 hints and that kept things moving at a good pace. Some of the puzzles were quite clever and there was a fantastic plot twist at the end that elevated the experience above the cliche Egypt theme.I will say that I felt the production quality of the room was on par with many of my other favorite rooms. So for your extra money, you aren't necessarily getting a better room than other places, but you do get a guarantee that you won't have to play with random strangers. You decide if that is worth the extra price."

I've done nearly 25 escape rooms and the Pharaoh's Tomb is one of my favorite rooms! This place doesn't just have your standard locks and keys. They REALLY made this place a unique experience! We thoroughly enjoyed every second of our time and wish so much we couldn't done their other room. Excellent decor, great story, incredible theming, and fantastic customer service! Jerome was an awesome Game Master and helped create a wonderful experience!"
