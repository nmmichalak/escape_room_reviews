"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escape-the-room-st-louis-the-submarine,2,"My wife and friends surprised me with this forMy birthday. It was a great, fun, entertaining hour! We did the submarine room. It was probably one of the more detailed sets Iâ€™ve seen. It also had a really interesting use of technology as both an part of the environment and part of the clues. We had 8 people, and needed nearly all of them to escape. With 3 minutes left.The professionalism and friendliness of this staff was also great. I would highly recommend and I will be going back to try their clock tower room soon."
