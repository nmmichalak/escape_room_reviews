"Escape room ""Oracle Mystery"" by SUBScape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/subscape-games-oracle-mystery,0,"The second room we did was Oracle Mystery.  I would say this room is intermediate difficulty.  It's gypsy/supernatural themed, but I wouldn't consider it scary.  This room was definitely more challenging.  I enjoyed this room.  It took us a minute to figure out where to start, and the puzzles in this room required more thinking.  We did require a hint for this room.  "

Challenging, but made it out with 3 minutes to spare! Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. Peter sent us in prepared for our mission! Would highly recommend."
