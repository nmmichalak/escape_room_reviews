"Escape room ""The Playroom"" by The Final Clue in Portage",https://worldofescapes.com/portage/quests/the-final-clue-the-playroom,0,"The Playroom was one of our favorite escape rooms so far! There were some really neat surprises! Our 11 and 14-year-old were also able to contribute a lot of help in the process, so it's a plus for families. We didn't quite finish, but were allowed to explore the final steps of completion before leaving. The young lady helping us was terrific! It was an awesome experience, and we will definitely be back to do the other room!"

It was a lot of fun! Challenge level was a bit low, this room is what i would consider a beginner or family room but we still had a lot of fun!"
