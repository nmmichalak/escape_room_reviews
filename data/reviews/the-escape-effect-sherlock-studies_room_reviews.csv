"Escape room ""Sherlock Studies"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-sherlock-studies,0,Awesome experience! We played the Sherlock game. It was extremely immersive and made us feel like we were in the time period solving the murder. Very well themed and the entire escape room flowed well with all the puzzles. Challenging yet never overwhelming. Would do again in a heartbeat!
"Escape room ""Sherlock Studies"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-sherlock-studies,1,This was my 12th room. I don’t even remember anymore. This was the nicest-looking facility I did an escape room in. The props were high quality. We did the Sherlock room. It was very challenging. This was the only room I have ever done where you are given 75 minutes. It is very detailed and complex. I thought it was a lot of fun. I plan to do another room here next time I visit this area.

Met Dan the owner who took the time to show us little fun surprises in the room after our time at Sherlock. Can’t wait to go back and try another room!

Wrong! Our group has done about 12 escape rooms apiece and still found Sherlock challenging. The clues were unique, puzzles were clever, and the staff was great! Dan did a wonderful job and we will definitely be back next time we are in town!"
