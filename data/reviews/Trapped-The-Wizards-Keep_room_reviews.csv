"Escape room ""The Wizard’s Keep"" by Trapped in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/Trapped-The-Wizards-Keep,0,Would give them zero stars if I could. There was no one at the store for our confirmed booking (paid for through Groupon). On top of that they haven’t even responded to my email I sent them after their no show.

If you're a Harry Potter fan, you will greatly appreciate the design of the room. Or even if you aren't, it's still worth it. The puzzles were challenging and clever. I think we finished in about 32 minutes. We will definitely be back to try the other rooms!"

The Wizard's Keep was just magical. It's like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, you just don't have to buy a ticket to Orlando! The puzzles weren't too difficult or varied but still fun and exciting. Great for Harry Potter fans! And our game master was just lovely. Great energy from her and she let me feel comfortable to fangirl."

It was a birthday party celebration for my daughter. Sean and Robin were very accommodating and gave us A+ service."
