"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Escape This Live: Columbus in Columbus (GA)",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus-ga/quests/escape-this-live-columbus-the-asylum,0,We went to Escape This Live to try out Asylum last night. There were three of us and we were happily included in a group of 6 others. The 9 of us without ever meeting worked really well together to figure out the room and escape in time! We even set a new monthly record! We had a blast - the workers were both great throughout the whole time and answered any questions we had. We will absolutely be back!
