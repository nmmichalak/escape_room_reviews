"Escape room ""Infectious Lab"" by Psycho 60 Escape Rooms in Winston-Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/winston-salem/quests/psycho-60-escape-rooms-infectious-lab,0,Did this as a team-building experience with some of my staff. We decided on the Infectious Lab room (medium difficulty) which was probably for the best as we made it out with only two minutes to spare. But we did make it out!! The puzzles were not easy and you definitely had to work together to get it figured out. Now we have to come back and try the Hostage room!
