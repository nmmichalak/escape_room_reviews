"Escape room ""Dead By Dawn"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-dead-by-dawn,0,"Ultimate Escape game is back with a BANG! Me and my fiancé are super enthusiast about escape rooms, and have done anywhere from 40-50 escape rooms with just us two! So, when we first wanted to start doing escape rooms, Ultimate Escape game was actually our very first one and the one who had us IN LOVE. Lindsey and her husband have also done many escape rooms and are amazing at creating puzzles that really make you think out of the box! My Fiancé and I had completed all of their escape rooms before the fire, and we came back to see what they cooked up for us this time!We did Death by Dawn and Fallout. Fallout is a HUGE room, and would be a great idea for a very large party. What I noticed off the bat is that they started using more mechanics in their rooms VS multiple types of locks like before. I was a little skeptical at first hoping it would not take away from the same experience but with the great minds of the owners and the cool mechanics combined, they have ROCKED IT!! They story line for Fallout was so clever, made you think, and we had done puzzles we had not seen before in any other escape rooms in the area, which is sooo refreshing!The second room we did was Death by Dawn. This is a smaller room, easy for two [experienced] people to complete, but very engaging and exciting (AND CREEPY!!) enough for a full room. The last puzzle was a doozy for us, but with only two people, I think it was much harder than we were making it out to be (LOL). All in all, this is again, the top of our list with our all time favorite escape places. We WILL be back to complete the others as soon as we can, and I can't wait to see what else is in store! Thank you to the owners who were resilient to come back after the devastating fire and flood, and come up with more ULTIMATE experiences!"

We did the ""Death By Dawn"" room and found the design and tech of the puzzle to be exemplary. Our team can't wait to go back and try another of the rooms!"

We had fun. Puzzles were intriguing and some of the room’s hidden surprises made the game enjoyable. Lindsey was a great game master. Would definitely recommend.
