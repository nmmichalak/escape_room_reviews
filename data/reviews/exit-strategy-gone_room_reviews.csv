We beat it and had a blast running around and figuring out the clues — the hints helped, but it was our first time there. I can’t wait to come back!"

"Escape room ""Gone"" by Exit Strategy in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/exit-strategy-gone,3,"Visiting from Tampa and being obsessed with escape rooms we HAD to give it a try! Gone was AMAZING! The props and the theming were INSANE! If you enjoy scary movies and being scared this room is SO worth it. We all felt like we were in a scary movie. The props were great, the puzzles definitely made you think, it truly was difficult in the best way. We will definitely be back next time we’re in Charlotte!"

The room was definitely a major challenge for two people, but Lauren was there the entire time. She also talked to us a bit and encouraged us to not be scared of some of the creepy things in the room. It definitely created a very enjoyable experience and she was super awesome! We will definitely be back!"
