"Escape room ""Resurrection"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-resurrection,0,I'm an escape room enthusiast with 140 rooms under my belt. My group of 4 did both Amnesia and Resurrection. These rooms are absolutely amazing. Quest rooms production value is the best of the best. They did a great job utilizing the actor sparingly in the room which I much prefer than having them standing over your shoulder the whole time. These are must do rooms no matter what your escape room experience is. They have set the bar even higher!
"Escape room ""Resurrection"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-resurrection,1,Incredible!!! I have played over 500 escape rooms and I see between 30-45 haunted attractions each year and Amnesia & Resurrection both impressed me! I highly recommend these experiences for anyone that loves story-driven escape rooms and/or haunted attractions. They are both a lot of adrenaline filled fun. Also Jasmine & Isaac were great! All the staff was great but they were our game masters.
