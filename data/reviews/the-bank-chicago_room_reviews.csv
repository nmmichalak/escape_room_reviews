"Escape room ""The Bank"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bank-chicago,2,"Seriously one of the coolest experiences ever! Our group had such a blast, we still can't stop talking about it and cannot wait to go again with friends and family! We didn't really know what to expect or look for when we first walked in, but soon enough all the clues started coming together once we put our heads together! Truly a group effort. This was so much fun and something cool, new, and different to do for a night out! I look forward to coming back and trying out the other rooms! Thanks again, Vince, for a great time!"

The rooms are challenging without feeling impossible to solve, so it was a lot more fun than other escape rooms that we've tried."
"Escape room ""The Bank"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bank-chicago,4,So different and completely entertaining! I cannot wait to go back to try a different room! The Bank got the best of us but I swear I will emerge victorious from The Bunker!!
"Escape room ""The Bank"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bank-chicago,5,"This is not my first room Escape, and Fox in a Box did anything but disappoint.  The online booking process was easy.  Great customer service from start to finish.  Tucked away in the basement of the historical Dearborn Station my group was welcomed yesterday evening by a cheerful game master.  We were made to feel very comfortable as we waited for our escape experience to begin.  Rules were explained clearly and then we entered 'The Bank'. We had a full hour of immersive fun and we, now a band of bank robbers, attempted to steal the Pink Panther Diamond.  We avoided the security guard, cracked codes, solved puzzles, and almost escaped with the Pink Panther......but time ran out.  The puzzles utilize many different type of thinking and logic so there is a little something for everyone.  The sound track definatly added to the excitement and I felt like I was the star of my own movie/video game. The game master was available to give us hints upon request, or to let us know if we got too far off track.This would be a great event for team building as you absolutely need to work together with your team mates on logical, physical, and creative tasks....and way more fun then trust falls.  I did read they have someone to give a team review upon request.  Great date night.  Great activity down town for locals and tourists alike.  In our case just a fun Wednesday-Funday evening adventure.  Can't wait to go back and try the Bunker!     "
"Escape room ""The Bank"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bank-chicago,6,Great escape room! We have done quite a few and this was one of the best in game design- challenging and in-theme. Great location right next to Bar Louie in downtown Chicago. Highly recommended!
