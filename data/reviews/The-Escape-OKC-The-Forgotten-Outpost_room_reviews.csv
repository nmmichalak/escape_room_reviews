We LOVED it!!!(even my 5 year old, who may have not been able to contribute much, but loved ""helping"" with the puzzles and locks). We will definitely be coming back soon to ESCAPE another room!"

Took my son for his birthday party with his older brother and his buddies. Played the hardest room. If we had 10 more minutes we would have figured it out. Thank you very much. We will be back.
"Escape room ""The Conquered Embassy"" by The Escape OKC in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/The-Escape-OKC-The-Forgotten-Outpost,5,Man oh man was this fun! We had three groups attend for a work event. Not only trying to get our of the room but wanting to be the ones who get out before your coworkers in other rooms added an extra element of fun! I was in awe of the creativity of the rooms and the clues. It was no doubt one of the most fun things I have done as an adult! I can't wait to return and try other rooms!
