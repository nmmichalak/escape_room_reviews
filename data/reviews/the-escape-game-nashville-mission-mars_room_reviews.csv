"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/the-escape-game-nashville-mission-mars,1,I absolutely loved this game! The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I played Mission Mars. It was better than I thought it would be. We were a mixed group of 3 smaller groups and we all worked together well to escape. I escaped Mars on my birthday! Must go!

Thank you for the great time and we will be back very soon!!"
