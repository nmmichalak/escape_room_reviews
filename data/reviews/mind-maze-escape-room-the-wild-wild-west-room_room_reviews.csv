"Escape room ""Wild Wild West"" by Mind Maze Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/mind-maze-escape-room-the-wild-wild-west-room,0,I took my daughter here for her 16th birthday with 6 of her friends. This was our first time experiencing an escape room game. The young lady who greeted us was awesome! She enjoys what she does and it certainly shows. We did the Wild Wild West room. It's amazing how fast an hour can go! It was lots of fun and laughs for the whole group. No time to get bored. Definitely makes you think if you want to get out. We were successful and still had 7 seconds to spare! Lots of fun. I definitely recommend it.

We rocked the Wild Wild West room! Not only did we figure out who killed the sheriff, but we also escaped with 2.5 minutes left. Everyone left wanting to do it again. Our host Patrick was the best. It was a great experience overall."
