We have been here 4 times now. They remembered us when we called to book a room. We did the dinosaur room first and almost escaped. (We were out of shape lol) then right after we did the tower of Dragons virtual reality room and man let me tell you, that was SO MUCH FUN!! It was so cool to solve clues in a different way with a headset on and ""gloves"" so different than a regular escape room but equally fun and exciting. All of their rooms have been so good and we love coming here."
