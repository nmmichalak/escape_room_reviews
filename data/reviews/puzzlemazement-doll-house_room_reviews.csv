"Escape room ""Doll House V.2"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-doll-house,0,"We did the ""Doll House""! This was our 6th Escape Room, and it was easily one of the best! This is the only one I have ever done that had 3 different levels of rooms that needed to be cleared. It was like unwrapping a present to find another present that needed to be unwrapped, and I loved that! The back story was creepy, but fun...which added its own special element to the whole experience! Jake was an excellent host, and I am excited to go back to try another room! Definitely money well spent!"

First time doing one and Ariel really helped a lot! She was able to guide us through some beginner rooms. We did 2 rooms, Dr. S (a steam punk room) and the doll house. Doll house was 3 stories and with 8 people we were able to make it with a minute to spare! Great team building exercise and super fun. Especially for the price. Definitely going to be doing more in the future."
