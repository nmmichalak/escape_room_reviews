"Escape room ""The Grey Project"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/the-exit-room-the-grey-project,0,Very fun!! We escaped with less than a minute left from the grey matter room and it was awesome! The game master was extremely helpful with his clues. Cannot wait to come back and try out the other rooms.
"Escape room ""The Grey Project"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/the-exit-room-the-grey-project,1,Excellent place! I love the challenge. This was the third different place I'd done an escape room and the Grey Project was the hardest one yet. Lots of fun!
"Escape room ""The Grey Project"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/the-exit-room-the-grey-project,2,"Our first time doing anything like this. So well put together. I had a group of 4 try out The Grey Project. Yes, it was hard, very challenging - but for an hour we were transported into a compelling story involving clues, puzzles, trap doors, FBI agents and aliens! We had so much fun, and we can't wait to get locked into another room! "
"Escape room ""The Grey Project"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/the-exit-room-the-grey-project,3,I had a group go through the Grey Project room. The room was well put together and had a nice little introduction to the scenario. The puzzles were varied and fun. The room flowed pretty nicely. We enjoyed ourselves and luckily completed the room with a few minutes to spare. I'd be interested in coming back and doing some of the other rooms. I'd highly recommend the Exit Room!
