"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Hidden Key Escapes in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/storage-room,0,This place is awesome and so much fun. We did the Storage room with eight people and it was challenging but we got out.  I loved the variety. Can't wait to do the other room.
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Hidden Key Escapes in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/storage-room,1,"We played The Storage Room today and of the 12-15 rooms I've played, this is easily in my top 2. 4 adults and 2 11-year olds made for the perfect team. We finished with under 5 minutes to go, but there is something for everyone to do in this room.Great variety of puzzles and some really creative ideas gives this room some amazing chemistry. Scott was flexible with our group and open to feedback, and Rachel, our guide was very helpful when needed!Looking forward to returning for the other rooms soon!"

It was really fun and challenging, but with 8 of us working together, not impossible! Everyone had something to do, but we ended up getting stuck and asking for a clue anyway. I would definitely come back here! Can't wait to try the other room!"

My girlfriend wanted to try an escape room for a long time, so we chose the Hidden Key Escapes. The host was nice and friendly, explained the concept since we are first-timers, and was attentive and helpful when we got stuck. I would definitely recommend Hidden Key to anybody interested in an escape room. We had a great experience."
