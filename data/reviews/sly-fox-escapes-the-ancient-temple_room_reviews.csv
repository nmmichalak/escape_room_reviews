The puzzles were challenging and fun to think through and discover. I appreciated the variety of riddles and puzzles mixed with the locks and key challenges. We had a group of 8 adults with a variety of backgrounds and talents and The Ancient Temple puzzle room was the perfect match for everyone's differing skills. I appreciate the style and creativity of the pre-room presentation and the detail to decor. of the actual puzzle room added to the experience. I love that the Puzzle Master's career backgrounds help them with the levels of creativity of this experience! Looking forward to the new room experiences!!!!
