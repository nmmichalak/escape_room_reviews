"Escape room ""Escape Artist"" by The Great Escape Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/the-great-escape-room-providence-escape-artist,0,"My friend and I stumbled into this place on a Sunday afternoon and did the Escape Artist at the staff's recommendation. It is their newest room and no staff member is inside the room to give you hints. After being assured that ""it's creepy, not scary,"" we were lead into the ""Iforgotthename"" hotel and truly had a blast. The two of us had done various escape the room games in Boston, New York and Beijing and agree that this is one of our favorite.  The puzzles are challenging, fun and interactive and have more tech elements than the typical lock-after-lock setup, which gets boring after a while.  As there were only two of us, we didn't successfully escape. But 4 people with some experience or 5-8 escape the room newbies should be able to escape.   One thing they can improve though is that it can be a little hard to get the hints because the volume of the walkie talkie is really low and unstable, particularly with the music playing in the background. Nonetheless, great design and a lot of fun!"
