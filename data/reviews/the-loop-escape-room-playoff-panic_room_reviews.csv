Didn’t escape but got pretty far I think. The couple who run this room are really sweet and made the experience an enjoyable one. I’d absolutely do another room if they came up with one."

This was our first experience with an escape room, and it was a fun. The staff was wonderful. I love that it is non-profit and it benefits their youth group. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun time!"
