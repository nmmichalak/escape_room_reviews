"Escape room ""BSQUAD"" by Unchained STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/unchained-stl-bsquad,1,We stopped by Unchained and they were able to fit us in. We met Nate and Lindsey (who are the owners) and they have great enthusiasm for escape rooms.They've done over a hundred! They have well thought out games and puzzles in the lobby and I wanted to spend more time there. Then we were called back to the room. The room was well decorated and well thought out with a variety of interesting gadgets. We made it out with 4 minutes left with the help of between 1 and 4 clues. Yes I know that's ambiguous. Can't wait to go again
