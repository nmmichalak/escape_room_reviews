"Escape room ""The Backyard"" by Trapped! in Lubbock",https://worldofescapes.com/lubbock/quests/trapped-lubbock-the-backyard,0,"This is my second time doing one of these, and was completely different than the past. We did The Backyard with 2 people which was unrecommended when we registered but was up for the challenge. We were on the very last puzzle when time expired, really impressed with the layout of the room and what we were supposed to do, wish we had 2 more minutes!"
