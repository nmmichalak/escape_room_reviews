"Escape room ""Western"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-flamingo-western,0,"We went on a work event, and did the Medieval room. We got out 30 mins early (perhaps just did some incredible teamwork), so we went for a second room, Western. This was most definitely a brilliant tester for teamwork, warmly recommend it for companies as it's particularly good for testing team trust. Overall great experience, the guys were super friendly, helpful and fun."
"Escape room ""Western"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-flamingo-western,1,Came here with a few co-workers and did the mid evil room room and the western room. Both of these were a lot of fun. The mid evil room allows for everyone to do their own thing while trying to escape from the room. This was cool as it allowed the room to progress really fast. They said there is about a 90% success rate for this room.Second we did the western room which had a 70% success rate. This one is GREAT for team building! I wont spoil it but a lot of teamwork is involved to escape the room.Staff is super friendly. If you choose they will allow for up to three hints per room via walkie talkie. Look forward to heading back to try out some of the other rooms.

From the beginning to the end, it is exciting. I don't want to give it away, but I love how you start the game. I never expected to have so much fun locked inside a room. "
