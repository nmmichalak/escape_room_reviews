"Escape room ""Fallout"" by Locked Up Bloomington in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/locked-up-bloomington-fallout,0,"My friends and I had an incredible experience with Locked Up! From the moment we came in, we were greeted by the extremely friendly hosts. The Gamemasters are gracious hosts and work hard to give you an incredible and challenging experience. They have created a warm space that helps you get ready for your chosen room. We tackled Fallout. The puzzles were clever and challenging and we, unfortunately, did not beat the clock. We hope to return to try other rooms to try and redeem ourselves! Everyone in the BTown area should definitely check this place out for future events--it really challenges you and your teammates to work together and to solve some clever problems."

My gf and I did the Fallout room with two strangers, but it was still a lot of fun. The puzzles were hard to crack but satisfying. Will be coming back!"
