"Escape room ""Flashback "" by Time to Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/time-to-escape-flashback,0,"Six of us did the 80's room, and we probably had more fun than any room we've played. There was plenty for everybody to do, and the theme was delightful. We beat it with time to spare, but it was definitely a challenge, couldn't have done it without working together."
"Escape room ""Flashback "" by Time to Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/time-to-escape-flashback,1,"This is the 4th location we have gone to and I was very impressed. We did the flashback room and the people before us failed so I went in a little nervous. I was pleasantly surprised with the technology of the room and the clues. The host was very friendly and the space was clean. I thought the room offered a great variety of clues and it was very interesting, I am excited to go back and try their other rooms."
"Escape room ""Flashback "" by Time to Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/time-to-escape-flashback,2,"Time to Escape offers games that use multiple rooms and stand out for their ability to transcend time through immersive design. The puzzles are challenging but not impossible to crack, they fit the theme well, and they keep you running back and forth between rooms for an active, engaging experience. When I played their time-traveling game""80's Flashback,"" I stepped into a bedroom with vintage teal and green carpet and realized we'd be using a boombox to play an actual cassette tape for a clue. It felt totally tubular to be sleuthing our way through the 80's. Time To Escape's other game transported me to 15th century Transylvania where I solved my way through the castle of Vlad the Impaler. This was the first time I'd ever used scent to solve a puzzle, or encountered props as authentic and unusual as a life size armor statue and historically accurate map of Romania."
