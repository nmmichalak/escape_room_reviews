Did their newest room Lost Temple and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our family of four and my brother's family of three which included teenagers, most of us were beginners and everyone had a blast. Suzanne really did great job explaining just enough and helped along the way. I especially appreciated that she went back and explained the puzzles afterward which gave us greater appreciation of puzzles and the Etruscan history. Highly recommended"
"Escape room ""Escape the Lost Temple"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-seattle-escape-the-lost-temple,2,My husband and I went with my three daughters and their significant others. We had a great time working together to solve the very difficult clues that allowed us to escape with very little time to spare - I did not think we were going to make it. It was amazing to see how the kids worked things out. I was little help but had fun trying. I appreciated at the end how the host rewalked us through the whole puzzle in a humorous and logical way. Thanks PuzzleBreak for a great adventure!
