"Escape room ""Fresh Meat"" by Locked Room Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/locked-room-omaha-fresh-meat,1,Visited Locked Room tonight with my wife and father. It was great fun! Puzzles were difficult enough to make it challenging but we did finish with 5 minutes left! We tried the zombie room and plan to come back for others. The owners are very pleasant as well!
"Escape room ""Fresh Meat"" by Locked Room Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/locked-room-omaha-fresh-meat,2,Such an awesome experience. Our group of four went through the Zombie room. So much fun and so challenging. It's a great way to spend time with friends and family doing something different than the monotonous dinner and a movie. You can really tell that there's a lot of thought put into the rooms in both puzzles and decor. The owner was very helpful and accommodating and made sure we were offered help when needed and all our questions were answered. We will definitely be back!
