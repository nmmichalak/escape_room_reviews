"Escape room ""Philadelphia Phrenzy"" by Escape Entertainment in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/escape-entertainment-philadelphia-phrenzy,0,"This was our first ever time doing any escape room! We went with four adults and two kids: 11 and 13. Another couple joined us. We did Philly Phrenzy room. We had SO MUCH FUN! Made it out with 4:44 to spare: not bad for a first time? I loved that the story and puzzles were challenging enough for the adults to feel stumped but still engaging for the kids. In fact, one of the puzzles required a specific knowledge that was my daughter's specialty and another was right along one of my son's, so that was neat! The staff was friendly and the facility was very nice. Great time overall and we would definitely visit again!"

Our host and game-master greeted us with a warm smile when we arrived. We got to start our game, Philadelphia Phrenzy, a little early since it wasn't crowded when we showed up -- although this place is so good that I'm sure they'll be booked solid in no time, so nab your time-slots now!!! The puzzles were tricky, but also really rewarding: there was a great mix of mental and physical tasks, and none of the solutions were intentionally obscure or illogical, so even when we got stuck, it was easy to step back and look at the puzzles from another angle. Teamwork is key! The clues were perfect, too -- just the right amount and at just the right time. I always felt like our game-master was paying careful attention and rooting for us -- especially at the end, when she sent us a message: ""You're so close. Keep up the good work!"" Our group was mixed, too -- one player was over seventy, and one wasn't yet a teenager, but the room was set up perfectly so we could all work together and each show off our skills. We escaped with about two minutes left, and we all had a blast. We couldn't stop talking about it as we left, and we can't wait to go back and try Time Trap and Prohibition. Seriously, why are you still reading this?!? Go. Now. Like, right now. You'll love it!"

We did the Philadelphia themed puzzle. The whole game was really well thought out. We had opportunity to work as a team and as individuals to solve the various puzzles necessary for escape. We would love to go back and try one of the other themes!
