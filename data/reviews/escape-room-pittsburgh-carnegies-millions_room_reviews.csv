"Escape room ""Carnegie's Millions"" by Escape Room Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/escape-room-pittsburgh-carnegies-millions,0,Our group did Carnegieâ€™s Millions and Kevin was our host. He was very friendly and helpful and we had an amazing time. It was part of a birthday week celebration. No one in our group had done an escape room before. We had so much fun and will definitely be coming back!!! We only wish there had been a clue telling us to refer back to the first room after we made it to the fourth room.

We did Carnegie's Millions and had a blast. We loved the unique theme and the puzzles that went along with it! We were a very experienced team and completed the room, beating the best time. Now we look forward to taking on the Tomb Explorer room! Hope to return in just a few weeks!"

The set up, the puzzles, the rooms, it was so well done. It was a little hard to know where to get started, but once we started on the first puzzle, you really start to think outside of the box, and get creative, more than you thought you could."
