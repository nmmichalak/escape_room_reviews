"Escape room ""The Missing Starlet"" by Elusive Escape Rooms in Wisconsin Dells",https://worldofescapes.com/wisconsin-dells/quests/elusive-escape-rooms-the-missing-starlet,0,My friend and I went here as part of a day trip to the Dells. We were walk-ins without a reservation and I had never done an escape room before. The staff was super friendly (Alex was our game-master) and he was very nice and welcomed any questions we had. I would recommend a reservation so you can choose any room you want. We did The Missing Starlet's Room which is the easiest out of all of them but is by no means easy. We didn't get out of it but it was still really fun. I would definitely go to this place again!
