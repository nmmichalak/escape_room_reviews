This was our first experience with an escape room and we loved it! We consider ourselves a pretty smart/clever group and we escaped with only 8 min. left. Can't wait to try another room!

The staff are all great and enthusiastic. Our group did the Jungle Escape, and the amount of teamwork we were failing at had us laughing the whole time (we tend to overthink things). We did escape though, and plan to return for the Zombie Room!"

It was definitely harder than we thought it was going to be but in such a great way! We came down to the last 3 seconds! The staff was also very friendly and nice! I'll definitely recommend this place and be back to enjoy the other two rooms as well!

We did the Jungle escape and ended up with 5 strangers. It worked out great because they were teenagers also and it was for 2 of their birthdays also. We made it out with 6 minutes left. It was a great experience and my kiddos had a blast!

I do think the ambiance/set could use a bit more attention, as part of the jungle set felt a lot like an empty room with some boxes to unlock. A great experience, but I think a lot more could go into feeling immersed in it all."
