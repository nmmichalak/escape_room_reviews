"Escape room ""The Scene of the Crime"" by Crazy Cat Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/crazy-cat-escape-room-the-scene-of-the-crime,0,"Great experience with Scene of the Crime. Most of the puzzles were a bit straightforward, and I wish we had just a tad less ""free helps"" as my team were very efficient at communication after we saw the free clues. Could be a bit more challenging!"

We did the crime scene room and had the best time. We escaped with 4 minutes to spare and have so many great stories to tell just from the 56 minutes spent in that room. Crazy Cat Escape Room is one of the funnest places I've ever been to. Not to mention, Harrison was a great game master. Can't wait to go back!"
