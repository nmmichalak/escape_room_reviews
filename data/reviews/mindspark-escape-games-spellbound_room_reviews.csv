"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-spellbound,0,Oh my God just got done doing Spellbound had such a great time set is unbelievably amazing pretty hard but all of it makes sense. I don't think we would have gotten as far as we did without our GM. Wish they had more rooms can't wait to do another one.
"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-spellbound,1,"Our group have completed around 15-20 escape rooms in Arizona and ""Spellbound"" is our consensus favorite room. The attention to detail and the design of the room is amazing. They definitely spent money creating this room.It was very challenging and we escaped with less than 3 minutes on the clock. But we have a pretty great group of six that work together really well. Wouldn't recommend this room for beginners, but once you've done a couple, you have to check out this room. Since completing ""Spellbound"", we compare every room we do to this one, and unfortunately, nothing compares to this room. Very friendly staff at Mind Spark, too."

SO FUN!!! The room is very decorated and the theme is great. Make friends with Alyssa and you can get extra clues if you request them. Clues are totally personalized and helpful. We had so much fun we booked the Zombie room on our way out! Can't wait to go back!

The clues were all super clever and let me say as someone with a few escape rooms under my belt, it was very different and more difficult than most, but in a fun way! Thanks so much to the amazing staff - you guys were awesome and we are definitely going to come back again! We drove all the way from Tucson to try it out and it was totally worth it!! Thanks for the great escape experience, Mind Spark!"
