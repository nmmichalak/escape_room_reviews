Great clues if needed. I love that all rooms are private no matter if itâ€™s just 2 people. I have had some experiences with overbearing people that makes it uncomfortable.

The owners, Kevin and Kristina, were very welcoming and polite. If you are looking for a challenge but great time, this is the place for you. We were able to escape and look forward to trying out their other room and any future rooms they design."
