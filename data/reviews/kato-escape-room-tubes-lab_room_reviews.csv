"Escape room ""Tubes Lab"" by Kato Escape Room in Mankato",https://worldofescapes.com/mankato/quests/kato-escape-room-tubes-lab,1,"It was my 61st birthday, and I have to admit I was a bit nervous when my 3 girls announced they were taking me to a locked room that we had 60 minutes to get out of! But I loved it! We did the Tubes room and were able to escape with 14 minutes to spare. The room was challenging and had many different puzzles and locks which added to the fun. Everyone was able to contribute to the ultimate escape. I would highly recommend this challenge and look forward to trying another room real soon!"
