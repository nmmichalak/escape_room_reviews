We had a BLAST with our Breakout Master MARLEY (like the Bob) lol. They have a great staff and will ensure you get your money’s worth. Go now and challenge yourself!!!

My friends and I did the Hostage room last night and it was probably my favorite. The experience was spectacular especially with our Game Master Sam. He was very helpful and with my crazy group of five, he was very interactive and kept it extremely entertaining. When we were close to getting frustrated, he was quick to come to our aid. With Sam it wad like having a friend on the controls helping us from the outside.I would highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 16! Go with a group as I've always found it more fun doing the rooms with only friends. Though I've been just as successful with a small group and random strangers in the room.Thanks again Breakout (and Sam!) "
