"Escape room ""Curse of Malachi"" by Think It Out Escape Rooms and Mental Gymnastics in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/descape-mission-mission-curse-of-malachi,0,What a great way to spend a birthday! I booked the Malachi room for my son and his friends. We showed up last night to play and they had a blast. To keep 6 teenagers fully engaged for an hour is no easy thing but this place definitely managed it. The best part was that they managed to get out with just over 2 minutes to spare! We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Thank you so much for everything!

I had no idea what to expect. I was amazingly surprised by the amount of fun we had trying to figure out clues to get out of a locked room! Lol! I HIGHLY recommend D'escape Mission for family and friends fun days but also for businesses that promote team building and churches that promote leadership strengthening! It's tricky, mind challenging, and super fun!!! Go, go, go!!!"
