We had a group of 5. Such a unique and fun experience. The staff are all super nice, and the place is so cozy. Kind of hard to find - it's in the same building as the Starbucks but down the sidewalk to the left of Starbucks main entrance."

It's a good time and we met some nice people from France and California that was in our group. We will be back to do other rooms - so, I recommend. I would have put 5 stars, but for me, it's not ""my cup of tea"". But it is my spouses and she absolutely LOVED it. So, for her, 5 stars for sure. If this is your sort of fun, it's worth it."
