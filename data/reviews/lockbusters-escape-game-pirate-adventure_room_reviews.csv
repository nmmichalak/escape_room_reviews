We explored the Pirate Adventure on our vacation. Very immersive with terrific ambiance - the attention to detail went down to the floorboards one really feels that they are in 'that world"". It was just the four of us and we almost--almost!--solved our game. It was satisfying even in defeat. The staff was very friendly and added to the ambiance. We'll getcha next time!"

It lives up to the claim that it's the most immersive, the sets were so highly detailed. We did both rooms, and the Pirate one was like no other I've ever done before. Not so challenging, but totally unique. I can't wait for the new ooms to open."
