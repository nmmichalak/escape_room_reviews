"Escape room ""Bullets and Broken Hearts"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-bullers-and-broken-hearts,0,"We came here after completing all of the Komnata Manhattan rooms (which are AMAZING) and weren't disappointed. We started at the 104 West Street location and did Doctor Frankenstein and Hex of the Chinese Jewelry Box, then moved on to the 67 West Street location for Joker's Cafe and Bullets and Broken Hearts. These rooms are the BEST in NYC, hands down - and we've done dozens. Also, shout out to Chris at 67 West - he was one of the best game masters we've worked with!"
"Escape room ""Bullets and Broken Hearts"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-bullers-and-broken-hearts,1,Loved this escape room! The puzzles were challenging and the staff were very welcoming. Thanks so much guys!
"Escape room ""Bullets and Broken Hearts"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-bullers-and-broken-hearts,2,"The room Bullets and Broken Hearts was BY FAR the best room I've ever done. The attention to detail was just incredible. I've done a bit over 10 different escape room companies and none have come close to my experience at Komnata. The puzzles were unique and inventive and the atmosphere was on point. Even from the point of walking in, you're not in some corporate office as you wait to be taken to a room, you're in a dark, well designed waiting room and you're brought blindly into the actual escape room. You can tell the creators of the room really cared about making sure every detail is right, as even the final ""puzzle"" where all you do is hit a switch involved some very high-end props. Highly recommended to any escape room enthusiast or someone new to escape rooms."
