"Escape room ""They're Coming"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-theyre-coming,0,"We have now done all 3 rooms at this location, after just completing - and escaping from - They're Coming on Sunday. We have done rooms at 2 of the other Maze Room locations and this one is BY FAR the best!!! The rooms are creative, the puzzles are clever and the staff is fantastic. On Sunday, John made They're Coming a great experience. He gave us tips when we needed but held back when we thought we could figure it out. And when he wasn't sure, he asked! Great concept. (At times I feel like game masters give unwanted help - over-enthusiasm, which I understand, but can be a bit frustrating/annoying.) John was very friendly, positive and genuinely excited for us. He definitely added to the zombie escaping experience. I wish I could say we'd be back, but they need to make a new room first. Please do!"
"Escape room ""They're Coming"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-theyre-coming,1,"This is another great Maze Rooms location with quality escape rooms. We played all three games at this location back to back. My husband and I played them, just the 2 of us. We liked all of them. The set design and props are well done. Our favorite was They're Coming. I'm a fan of Evil Dead, so I loved all of nods to it. The puzzles were clever and fun. The set design and props were top notch. The story is clear."
"Escape room ""They're Coming"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-theyre-coming,2,"I have done quite a few escape rooms and the ""They're Coming"" room has been one of my favorite ones to date. The production value was incredible and the room went through without a hitch. My inexperienced group and I got through the room with 5 minutes to spare using two hints. It had just the right amount of challenge to it, while still being creative, unique, and a little scary. Our game master was Joy and she made the experience immersive and was friendly and funny, making us want to come back to try the other rooms. 10/10"
