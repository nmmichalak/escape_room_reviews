The scenes and ambiance were absolutely perfect and really made us feel like we were on the pirate ship. The puzzles make you think but are solvable. Looking forward to checking out the other rooms these guys are putting together."

I really liked that they asked for feedback on our favorite and least favorite puzzles. It shows that they are always improving things."
