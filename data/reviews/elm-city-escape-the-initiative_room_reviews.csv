"Escape room ""The Initiative"" by Elm City Escape in New Haven",https://worldofescapes.com/new-haven/quests/elm-city-escape-the-initiative,0,"Tried out the Initiative room at the Elm city escape room with 3 of my friends. We walked into the lobby, they explained the rules to us and then led us to the room. Was worried about trying to solve it without the maximum number of people but ended up alright since the group I was with were pretty good with puzzles. It was a fun time, there were 2 puzzles that I thought were really clever, and I got to make a big mess of the room. Will probably try the other room when it is ready."

The game was immersive, the puzzles were cohesive, and most importantly, the experience was aptly challenging. Everyone in my group of 4 had a great time. The puzzles where plentiful and solving them require a good sense of deductive reasoning and critical thinking."
