"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-hostage,0,My boyfriend and I do Escape Rooms all the time. We've been to almost every one in Pittsburgh. This is our second time at Breakout Pittsburgh and it's definitely the best one! The staff is awesome and the rooms are even better. We've done Hostage and for Valentines Day we did the Casino Room alone. ITS DEFINITELY A GREAT DATE NIGHT!
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-hostage,1,Hostage was so much fun! We had a group of 7 people ranging in age from 14-64. It was such a great time and we can't wait to go back and try another room!

I went and did the Hostage room with my husband, dad, and mom. Would definitely recommend to others and would definitely come back again to try another room. We had a great game master who helped us when we needed a push in the right direction, without giving too much away (sometimes even just to say ""you're overthinking it"", haha). We were fairly nervous going in, having never done any escape rooms before, but we were amazed how each of us ended up fulfilling some role in figuring out the puzzles and the staff made us feel at ease. To our own surprise, we ended up escaping with :39 seconds on the clock. Couldn't believe it. It was well put together and the staff were great. Glad that they have a wide range of open hours to accommodate a variety of schedules. My husband and I will definitely be back to try this again sometime!"

Our guide Nick was super friendly and helpful. We did the Hostage escape, and we started off blind folded and handcuffed. My group of friends had a lot of fun strategizing and putting the pieces together to escape. We did it in 47 minutes. I would definitely go back and try another room."

The puzzles/clues are well thought out and just the right amount of challenge, we finished with five minutes left! Very engaging staff, it's apparent they love what they do. Our game supervisor was playful and encouraging; the game experience was immersive but not the least bit creepy/uncomfortable. Will most certainly be back!"
