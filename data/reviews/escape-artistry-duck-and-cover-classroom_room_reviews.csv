"Escape room ""Duck and Cover Classroom"" by Escape Artistry in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-artistry-duck-and-cover-classroom,0,The puzzles are clever and the specialized hints really kept us moving along. Compared to other room escapes (we've done many!) this one has a great design aesthetic and is well produced.

The first room was Dollhouse, lead by Monarch.  Our team of 6 was able to work on different puzzles at the same time instead of having to follow a linear course of action which we loved.  There were definitely a few things that tripped us up and that just made it so much better.  After completing that (and beating it with only 12 minutes to spare) we were excited to try another game at the same facility.  We did Duck and Cover, lead by Sweetheart and found it a bit more challenging.  The games were a little more linear at first but at one point we were able to break off and work some puzzles more individually.  It took some team effort to get the final puzzle but we loved it and it really tested our skills and finished with about 10 minutes left.  We are already planning our next trip back to try a couple of the other rooms!  Thanks so much for a great day!"
