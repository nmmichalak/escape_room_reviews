"Escape room ""Island Missile Crisis: This is not a drill"" by Room With a Clue in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/room-with-a-clue-lost-in-paradise,1,"Went with a group of friends and did the lost in paradise room. As soon as we entered the place we were greeted and asked to sign some waiver forms. After we got the waiver forms done we waited in the lobby and played with all the puzzles until our room was ready. The room itself was really fun and i like all of the puzzles. You get 60 minutes to try and complete all the puzzles to escape, you also get three free clues you can ask for help. Overall, we had a great experience."

I am pleased to say that completing Lost in Paradise with my boyfriend and we were quite stumped and the puzzles are quite unconventional. However, it was a very nice change of pace and I enjoyed it very much! My boyfriend and I had an amazing time communicating with each other and even though we did not get to escape, we had a good time! Our game master, Bryan, had such a good attitude and helped us immensely. I have come back and completed A Stranger Case and that room is just nostalgia central! I really enjoy the themes and hope to see more rooms."
