"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,0,We went as a big group and had a blast doing the Camelot room! Samuel was helpful and very friendly! It’s a fun time for big groups. I recommend everybody to go and try it out.
"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,1,"We did the Camelot room. It was fun and very cleverly done. We ran out of time butt it was our first time. We didn’t realize that some steps had multiple steps. We were trying not to use hints. We finally used one... we got to the last step. I will say that it would have been better to say...10 steps, and spend less than 6 minutes per step. That budgeting would have helped...then, if we got stuck after 4 minutes, then use a hint. So, we want to go back and try that logic next time."
"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,2,"We tried the Camelot Room on a recent Friday evening (along with my youngest son’s college roommate). We called and reserved the room in advance.The 2 staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. After paying and signing waivers, we were shown a short video explaining the “Do’s & Dont’s” and how to use the iPad.They have lockers where you store your cell phones (& other items if you choose), as they do not allow phones in the rooms.This escape room does not use interactive game masters that we were used to. Instead, your hints are delivered by scanning QR codes around the room with the iPad. When you use the hints, it deducts from your time. There is also a bell in the room that you can ring at any time to have a game master come in and help if needed.We found the Camelot room to be challenging, but not to the point that it was frustrating. It wasn’t easy, but it also wasn’t so hard that it was unsolvable. The theme, layout, and props were all thought out very well.Without using any hints, we did escape with a couple of minutes to spare. Although I must admit, had it not been for our kids, my wife and I probably would’ve struggled a little more to make it out in time.After you escape, they take a group photo, which they post to their Facebook page.Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely try one of the other rooms next time!The only negative thing I can say (and it’s not that big of a deal) is that their sign and parking area were not very well lit and we actually passed the place when we first drove by."
