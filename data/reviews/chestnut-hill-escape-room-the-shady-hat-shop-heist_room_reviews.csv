"Escape room ""The Shady Hat Shop Heist"" by Chestnut Hill Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/chestnut-hill-escape-room-the-shady-hat-shop-heist,0,"We cam here as a family (7 members) between Christmas and New Years 2019 and had an absolute blast. Our guide, James, was knowledgeable and patient with our group of mostly first timers to the Escape Room experience and gave us comprehensive rundown of what to expect and prepare us for the experience. The room itself was cleverly designed with almost every clue being both completely obscured and yet right in the open which made it perfect for those with a keen sense of observation. The one hour time frame was just about right as we were able to figure it out with only the slightest assistance from James which made it feel well earned but just having him there in case you were really stuck was comforting and should be very useful for those afraid to try an escape room for the first time. I would strongly suggest this adventure to others, especially as a group/family activity as it is quite the value for spending some quality time with those we love.  Five stars out of five, highly recommended for all!"

We have done a few other escape rooms and this one was one of my top favorites. It was so interesting and challenging and well put together! We had two kids with us 10 and 8 and they enjoyed it as well!

We completed the Shady Hat room - it was challenging but a lot of fun. This location is pretty new but definitely should be here for awhile!
