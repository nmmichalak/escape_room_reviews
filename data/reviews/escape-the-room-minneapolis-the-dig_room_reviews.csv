"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-the-room-minneapolis-the-dig,0,"Super fun group activity. Like others have said, it's difficult, but not so hard that it's impossible. We did the Dig, and it took us almost the entire time to solve the puzzles. It was really exciting every time we solved a puzzle, and they're really good at giving you clues when you really need them. I'd definitely go back!"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-the-room-minneapolis-the-dig,1,We did The Dig. There were 8 of us. It was a lot of fun. Very challenging. The girl that helped us was very nice. She gave us clues when we needed help. We made it out under 60 min. It was a very good experience for us first-timers.

The puzzles were just difficult enough to take up a good amount of the allotted time yet still solve them before the time ran out. The set was nice (we did ""The Dig"") and I would love to try the rest sometime. The staff was great too."

The waiting area has nice mind games. The staff was super nice, knowledgeable, and overall friendly. The room almost took us the whole hour to do and we all honestly would have loved to try another one of their rooms."

There were only two of us and we made it out with under a minute left. Such a beautifully designed room, and challenging puzzles. Technology was really put to good use here and it was very immersive. This one was seriously a blast.I also really liked how the hints were indirect, given as clues instead of just telling us outright what to do. It was just the nudge in the right direction that we needed.We've done 10+ rooms in the area and this one ranks up in the top 3. We'll definitely be back."
