"Escape room ""King Tut's Treasure"" by Escape Modesto in Modesto",https://worldofescapes.com/modesto/quests/Escape-Modesto-King-Tuts-Treasure,0,Sooooo fun!! Definitely start with King Tut's room if it's your first time. When they say easy it just means least difficult. Great for friends or work.
"Escape room ""King Tut's Treasure"" by Escape Modesto in Modesto",https://worldofescapes.com/modesto/quests/Escape-Modesto-King-Tuts-Treasure,1,"Took the Escape Modesto challenge with some friends a couple of weeks ago. We did the King Tut room. Not to give much away but it was fun and very very challenging. We felt a little silly asking for help but fortunately the voice on the other end got us through the tough parts without giving anything away. Highly recommend if you have a mixed group of fun brainiacs, however you don't need to be a genius to contribute but being clever definitely helps. Can't wait to try the next rooms!"
"Escape room ""King Tut's Treasure"" by Escape Modesto in Modesto",https://worldofescapes.com/modesto/quests/Escape-Modesto-King-Tuts-Treasure,2,My wife and I went to Escape Modesto for the first time on Saturday. It was our first attempt at an escape room so we tried King Tuts Tomb. We had so much fun. Katie was so professional and did a great job explaining the rules and how best to work together. Even though we were playing with several groups of strangers we worked well with each other and most importantly had a blast. Definitely will be back to try the other rooms!
