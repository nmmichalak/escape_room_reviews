"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-operation-casino,0,"Did Operation: Casino for my birthday with the family. We had six people, I think that is a great number. It was so much fun! Really challenging, but we did it! The staff was very friendly.We did have issues with a lock and spent at least ten minutes working on it not knowing it was broke. Time had to be stopped to fix it, our guy was awesome and didnâ€™t start the time back up right away, but it would have been fun to see if we would have solved it faster then we did with no issues. I understand things can happen, and we still had a lot of fun regardless of the lock! We will definitely be back to try another room!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-operation-casino,1,Went for the first time last night. We played Casino. Your team will have to do a ton of math to solve this puzzle. We broke out with five minutes left and I would definitely go back to breakout games and try another room. So much fun. We went for my wives birthday!
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-operation-casino,2,We did the casino Royale game. It was a challenge but perfect for our group of two kids and five adults. Kids could participate but I don't think could have done it alone. Ages 9 and 12. Very friendly staff.

I thought it had clever ideas that involved a laser. It was a great value through the Groupon. I would have enjoyed it more if there was less help with clues. I'd rather not get out and have no clues than get out with the help of clues. Maybe they could ask that ahead of time.
