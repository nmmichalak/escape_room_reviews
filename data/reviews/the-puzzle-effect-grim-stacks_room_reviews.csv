"Escape room ""Grim Stacks"" by Puzzle Effect Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/the-puzzle-effect-grim-stacks,0,"Our family loves this place, we have experienced two of their rooms and both times we have had a great time. Staff is wonderful and takes time to walk through the unfinished puzzles. It is a great place for children to explore and try new things because the staff caters to their inquisitive minds."
"Escape room ""Grim Stacks"" by Puzzle Effect Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/the-puzzle-effect-grim-stacks,1,We really enjoyed this company! We've completed over 60 escape rooms and have done most of our rooms in Southern California and the set design here definitely stacked up to what we're used to at home! We completed The Path and Grim Stacks Books and Bindings. Out of the two we preferred Grim Stacks because we really enjoyed the puzzles in there a lot more and it had a better overall story. Our two hosts were really nice (sorry I forgot your names!) but they did a great job with their clue system and were kind enough to offer us a same day discount to book a second room which is why we ended up doing Grim Stacks! I would definitely come back to check out there other room just based on set design and our game masters alone. Thanks for hosting us and we will see you next time we're in Boise!
