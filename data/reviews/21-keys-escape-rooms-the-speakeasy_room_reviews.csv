"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by 21 Keys Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/21-keys-escape-rooms-the-speakeasy,0,"I’m an escape room addict at this point- I’ve done almost 20 of these!  This is my first one at 21 keys, I went with a group of 4 from work.  The atmosphere was really good, and the puzzles were challenging without being frustrating.  I definitely recommend this place.  I’ll be back for some of their other rooms "

The Speakeasy room game was challenging but the puzzles were still able to be solved. Everyone in our group had a blast and we all want to do it again.

I really liked that they made it really clear what wasn't a clue to avoid wasting time without ruining the challenge of it. We had a group of 10 and everyone got to be involved without feeling like we were standing on top of each other. 100% will be back!
