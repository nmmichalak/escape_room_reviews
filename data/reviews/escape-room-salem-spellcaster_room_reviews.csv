Without using too much hyperbole, Dark Raven's Realm was gorgeously decorated, gameplay was ingenious, and the the use of animatronics was inspired. We might even go back to improve on our time, we loved it so much!"

We did the Spellcaster today with the kids and they had more fun than I've seen them have in a long, long time. The wands provided were even interactive and necessary for solving some puzzles! For an hour, my little wizards were in heaven.Our attendant fed us clues once in a while when we were stuck. He was extremely helpful and courteous, completely intent on making our time as fun as possible. Completely hooked. I want to do another one!"
