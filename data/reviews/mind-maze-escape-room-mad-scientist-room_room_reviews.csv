The theme was Mad Scientist and Nurse Ben and Patrick took great care of us! The clues were seriously tough but awesome! I couldn't have had a better time. We went as a group of 6, and every person played a part in solving our puzzle. I can't wait to go back and try the Wild West theme as well as the Secret Agent theme."
