"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,0,"This was our first Escape Room in Boise and we had a great experience. We did the Pirate themed Escape Room and had a lot of fun. It was not as difficult as I had anticipated but the puzzles still required us to think and work together. Each of us was able to contribute in solving different puzzles. Naomi was our lovely host and she was very helpful with her clues. We only needed 2 clues throughout our Escape Room experience but both of the clues given by Naomi were descriptive, clear, concise and ultimately helped us get through the areas where we got stuck. The clues were very well thought out and the room was very clean and organized. I highly recommend this Escape Room to anyone in the Boise and surrounding areas."

Rooms are amazing and the puzzles are fun yet challenging. The amazing staff also made this a five star business!!! Can't wait to come back!! Did 2/3 rooms in one day haha

"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,4,I have done both their Ship and Wizard room and they were both awesome! The wizard was more challenging but the special effects and their ability to 'do magic' was great!
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,5,Super cool experience and would recommend to anyone. I was very impressed by the little details. 
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,6,"ed the puzzles!  The employee was clear, helpful, and seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  It was fun and challenging.  I wish I had booked a private room or scheduled a group because I think it would be more fun with people you know, but even with others, it was a riot!  Definitely coming back for more!!!"
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,7,"This was such a cool experience! When you walk into any of the rooms, it feels like you are in a different place. The only thing I wish was that they had is more rooms! It is great for group dates and birthday parties because you get to interact and communicate while trying to figure out the puzzles that are all around the room. The people who work there are really nice too. If you have an issue signing up, or any problems within the room, they are always available and more than willing to help!"
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,8,My family has done both the pirate and western theme & both were really fun. My 11yr old couldn't stop talking about how fun the experience was! Management was easy to work with and responsive to questions/concerns. I wouldn't recommend taking kids younger than about 7 or 8 because they won't understand the clues.
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,9,"Loved both escapes, saloon and pirate. Have done others and these are my favorite. I don't consider myself as knowledgeable as those in my group and was surprised to find that I was able to actively participate and had a lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Pirate Ship"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-blackbeards-ship,10,As soon as you are in the room you are transported into the pirate ship. Everything seems so real. All the clues come together nicely. It was a lot of fun! I like a good challenge but even better I love solving the hard puzzles!
