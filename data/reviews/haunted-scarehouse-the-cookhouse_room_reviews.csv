We've tried the Cookhouse and the Great Room so far and loved both. The puzzles and attention to detail were fantastic. The owner, Steve, is also really friendly and fun to talk with. Our group is looking forward to trying the rest of the rooms."

Some of them definitely took us by surprise! We escaped and can't wait to come back for the other rooms.
"Escape room ""The Cookhouse"" by 13th Hour Haunted House in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/haunted-scarehouse-the-cookhouse,2,I played the Cook House escape room with a friend and we were paired up with a pair of 1st-time escape room players. The decor was pretty much the best I've ever seen in an escape room. Incredibly immersive. The puzzles were very good and not overly hard but still required thought.We escaped with 4 minutes remaining and used several clues. I've played about 12 different games in NY and NJ and this was the one I enjoyed the most. This is due to the incredible detail in the set design and the flow of the game.
