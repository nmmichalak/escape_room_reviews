"Escape room ""Takeover"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-takeover,0,This is one the BEST escape rooms in all of San Diego. I've done this 6 other times and I am impressed on how elaborate their rooms are. I took 2 different youth girl basketball teams and we all had a blast. This was great for team building and can accommodate all age levels. The staff is very professional as well. Denzel was very good in facilitating the groups and I can't thank him enough.

Went in with friends as a group of 5 which was a good size for the escape room we did. The tasks weren’t too complex but involved just the right amount of brain power and at the end of it we felt pretty accomplished and happy! We escaped! 🔓🕵️‍♀️
