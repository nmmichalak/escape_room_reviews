We did The Overgrown and the puzzles were so well thought out and intuitive. It was very well created in that the room was nicely decorated to the theme and you can tell that the employees really care about the experience. Joe was our guide, and he was so enthusiastic and kind! I am definitely looking forward to coming back and trying the other room they offer!"
