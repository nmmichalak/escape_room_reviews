"Escape room ""Silent Night"" by Solve Entertainment in Duluth",https://worldofescapes.com/duluth/quests/solve-entertainment-silent-night,2,"Fun, funny, and a bit frightening! This was my first time doing an escape room. My group of friends and I had a great time with our game master, Lance, for ""Vanishing Act"". The clues were tricky and there were some red herrings to throw you off the trail. This escape room was good for first timers and is family friendly. Will visit again!"
