"Escape room ""Mystery of Sherlock"" by Adventure Vault in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/adventure-vault-mystery-of-sherlock,1,We had so much fun in the Sherlock room!! It was tricky but once we got going it was awesome! Everyone in the group was able to participate which made it more fun. We made it out in time!! We did get some hints on some of the clues. Also Daniel was so nice and helpful when booking our reservation and greeting us! Check it out!! I can't wait to go back to try another theme!

We did the Mystery of Sherlock room which was super fun and very challenging. This was my first time doing an escape room and I had a blast. Trying to solve all the riddles and clues was a lot of fun. This place is a MUST DO! Really recommend going with a group. The staff was really nice, friendly, and helpful. I can't wait to go back and check out the other rooms."
