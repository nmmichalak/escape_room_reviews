"Escape room ""Escape the Forest"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-forest,0,"My experience was everything but amazing. The sets were subpar. If you're into misleading and unrealistic props and broken set pieces, then this is the place for you. In addition, the majority of ""props"" were off limits, which distracts you from the objective of the game and frustrates you!The story of the Forest room wasn't chronological, so the clues were hard to put together. We did make it out, but it was anticlimactic. We had 8 people in the room and it was very congested. It should be 4-6 people max. I at least hope the other rooms are better..."
"Escape room ""Escape the Forest"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-forest,1,We had so much fun! We had a very challenging room with 8 people. We felt very accomplished by completing the most difficult room - The Forest - with 3 minutes to spare. Highly recommend it. Can't wait to go back and try a different room.

"Escape room ""Escape the Forest"" by Amazing Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-forest,4,It was a first-time experience for me and it did not disappoint! We did the Forest room which is one of their hardest. You just have to read very carefully to be sure you don't overread or overthink some of the clues. Can recommend this place to everyone. Loved the experience!
