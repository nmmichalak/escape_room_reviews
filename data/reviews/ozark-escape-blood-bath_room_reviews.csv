"Escape room ""Missing"" by Ozark Escape in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/ozark-escape-blood-bath,0,"Took my staff to Ozark Escape for some team building and bonding. We did the ""Blood Bath"" room, and had a blast! The scenario was appropriately designed (creepy, but not too scary), the puzzles were creative, and our team managed to escape with four seconds left. The staff was clever and helpful, and we all left with the desire to do more puzzle rooms. I highly recommend Ozark Escape for any group wanting some fun. We'll be back!"

The staff was very friendly and accommodating with our scheduling requirements. The puzzles were clever, challenging, engaging, and fun.
