We went with two other couples and it was a really fun group date night. The staff was courteousâ€‹ and informative- none of us had ever been to an escape room before.

There were puzzles at every corner and it was truly a challenge but we managed to escape with 8 minutes left. Staff was very friendly and helpful with clues to subtly steer you in the right direction. Will definitely be back for the attic!
