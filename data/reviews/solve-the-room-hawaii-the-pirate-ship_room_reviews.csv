"Escape room ""The Pirate Ship"" by Solve the Room Hawaii in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/solve-the-room-hawaii-the-pirate-ship,0,"Nicely themed however, this looks nothing like a ship. Too bad, if it had, it would have been really cool. Some well-designed puzzles. Good for 3-5 players. On the down side, the hint system used a tablet for receiving texts. Players should have their hands free. There are little red stickers on items “not to be interacted with.” -- mostly items on the walls. This just takes away from the immersion experience and these items should be propery secured in place. This is lazy room construction. I hope the company fixes these issues for their new rooms. I do recommend tryning this room. Over all I have fun memories of solving it."
