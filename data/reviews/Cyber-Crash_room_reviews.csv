"Escape room ""Cyber Crash"" by MindQuest Escape Games in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/Cyber-Crash,6,"We have played all four games offered at Mindquest Live, completing them all for the exception of Cyber Crash which the staff indicate is the hardest one they offer. We enjoyed the Diamond Heist game the most but would highly recommend any of them. Games: Diamond Heist and The Bomb are of a similar difficulty level (the easiest ones they offer), Mad Scientist was much, much harder, and Cyber Crash is the hardest - and we have yet to fully complete it but we keep trying!! Hoping Mindquest Live will off some new games as our family enjoys them so much. Staff are friendly, the games are well organized, appropriately difficult, and fun, and the lobby is decorated with everything steampunk which is a lot of fun to explore if you have to wait a few minutes for your game. Go!"
