"Escape room ""King Tut’s Curse"" by Espionage Escape Rooms in Valparaiso",https://worldofescapes.com/valparaiso/quests/espionage-escape-rooms-king-tuts-curse,0,This escape room is my favorite and this is my favorite room in Chicagoland. The theme and decor is great. The place also has a great small town local feel and the owner is great. Inside the room the clues are great and enough to keep you guessing right until the last second. The game is built super well to where you it takes just around an hour for the average person to get out. The ending of the game is also super cool!

We did the King Tut room. Was skeptical at first, actually bought the group tickets for a Christmas present for my wife. I knew she would definitely enjoy something like this and tried to give her a night out with the girls. Well, it turned into a fun family night out. Had a ton of fun and will definitely try and get back to do the other room. Thanks for the experience!"
