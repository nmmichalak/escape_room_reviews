"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Rush To Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/rushtoescape-prison-break,0,"This was my (our) first escape (Prison Break) and it was an absolute blast! Dan was so nice and gave awesome clues when needed - just enough to point the general way, but still left it to the players to figure it out. Our group’s age range went from 9 to over 50, and everyone stayed joyfully engaged and entertained. I will be recommending Rush to Escape to all my friends! Can’t wait to go back and try Sherlock. "
