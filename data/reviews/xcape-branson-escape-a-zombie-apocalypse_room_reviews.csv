No we did not make it out, but we were close. It far exceeded our expectations! Our host was Charlie and he was awesome. He told us all about how it was built and new ideas they had for it. He was so enthusiastic it made us want to come back to Branson next year just to see all the new stuff they have planned. Great experience! Highly recommend!"

Great story, great effects, and overall a great experience! Our group had my mom, Husband, 11yo son, and myself. Nope, didnâ€™t make it out, but we were close! Might even consider doing the haunted house soon! Definitely worth every penny!"
