"Escape room ""Poker Room"" by Escape AC in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-ac-poker-room,0,"My fiancé and I came to AC this week and went to EscapeAC not once, but twice! We did the Boardwalk room and the Poker room. Loved them both. We came so close in the Poker room. Both times we were a group of 4 people. Can’t wait to do it again."

The detail that was put into the room was amazing. Even though we didn't escape from the Poker room (2 clues shy of getting out), we had a blast. Can't wait to go back and try the other rooms."

We had a group of 4 in the poker room and it kept us busy! We didn't escape, but still tons of fun. If you like puzzles, thinking outside the box, and a little team work, you'll love this. We will definitely try again next time we visit."

The Poker Room was challenging but fun. We didn't win, but we did pretty well for a group of three - especially given this was the first time doing this for the other two. If you plan on doing this room, don't let a second go to waste.Keep in mind also that this is a hard room! You don't want your first room to be one with a 5% success rate, trust me."
