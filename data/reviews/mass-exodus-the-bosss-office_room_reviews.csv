"Escape room ""The Boss's Office"" by Mass Exodus in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mass-exodus-the-bosss-office,0,"As a natural problem solver enthusiast, this was an enjoyable and memorable team building experience for me and four of my good friends that I have known for over twenty years. This was all of our first times doing an escape room, but the professional and helpful staff provided great instructions at the beginning to prepare us for the activity. We did the “Boss’s Office”, and felt that the Mass Exodus team clearly put a lot of thought into the design of the room and the clues provided were very helpful, but you have to keep an open mind and think logically:) (that's the only tip I will give, lol).We unfortunately fell short of escaping, but we all enjoyed the camaraderie and look forward to returning in the near future as we are determined to escape from “The Revelation Room”. For those of you who like problem solving, I think that Mass Exodus is definitely a ""must"" outing for families of all ages, friends, and colleagues alike. You won't be disappointed."

I was excited as it was my first time. The facility was well lit, clean, and very inviting. The owner Natasha was very nice and friendly. She welcomed us and went over the rules for The Big Boss room. Needless to say, we didn't escape; but I had so much fun trying. Thanks for a great adventure I'm recommending this to anyone that loves to solve a good mystery."

We've done Revelation Room and The Boss's Office. Each time, we've had a wide age range and each time we've escaped. The staff is so thoughtful and the give you plenty of clues, along with some special extra! Great job Staff. Each time, we were greeted promptly and the room was explained thoroughly. I love how clean and pleasant the check in area was. Thank you to the William's for a wonderful time!"
