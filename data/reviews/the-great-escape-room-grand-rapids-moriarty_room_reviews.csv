The clues and puzzles were just the right amount of difficulty. Melissa did a great job curating and gave excellent hints. We ended up beating the record, escaping in 31:35!"

"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Grand Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-rapids/quests/the-great-escape-room-grand-rapids-moriarty,3,"Went with a group of nine (all in our 30s) and we had a great time. Throughout the rest of the night, we all kept commenting how fun our experience was. We were in the Game Room and I was impressed by the thoughtfulness that went into the whole theme of the room and the puzzles. Mackenzie was an excellent 'guide' and really enhanced the whole experience for us with her professionalism and wit. We finished before the buzzer but make no mistake, the puzzles were challenging and creative. Will be coming back for the other rooms."

We had just 2 people in the Game Room and it was difficult! Almost made it! Thank you TGER and our beautiful and awesome room coach Marissa for a great experience!"
