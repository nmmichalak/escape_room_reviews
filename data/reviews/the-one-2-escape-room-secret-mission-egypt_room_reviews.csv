We did the Mission: Egypt escape room. The puzzles got progressively harder, and there were many interactive and creative puzzles. I liked this place more than others because of their unique twists and mix of mechanics and technology within the game. Every detail was thought out down to the elaborate decor, and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back for more rooms!"

Super cool mechanics and would definitely look into doing the other rooms too! Owners are awesome and the staff were great at guiding us through the room to complete it with just minutes to spare!
