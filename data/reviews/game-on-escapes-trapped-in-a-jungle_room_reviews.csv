"Escape room ""Trapped in a Jungle"" by Game On Escapes & More in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/game-on-escapes-trapped-in-a-jungle,0,"So much fun! We went to game on last night with a group of 8 and got stuck in the jungle, our game master David was awesome and knew just when we needed some nudges. This was my first escape room experience and it did not disappoint. We will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Trapped in a Jungle"" by Game On Escapes & More in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/game-on-escapes-trapped-in-a-jungle,1,"We had a party of 16 and used both rooms.  These were tough games.  We didn't get out of the Jungle but it couldn't have possibly been any closer.  It was a lot of fun.  I haven't been to another one so i can't compare.  I assume, however, that it's a good one.  We liked the hosts who were very nice and people be obnoxious.  The joint could be freshened up a bit but otherwise was great.  I want to go back and try MacGregor Manor."

Justin made it really fun and helped us when we got stuck with some clues. Best escape weâ€™ve been to!
