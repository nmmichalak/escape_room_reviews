"Escape room ""Lunar Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-lunar-mission,0,"High production value, and a perfect way to spend the night out. Our group escaped with no hints needed, and almost beat the record for best time, being off by about 1 minute. They give you space suits to wear in this room and you really feel like you are in space. This one was a little more challenging but nothing too difficult. "
