"Escape room ""Apartment 1145"" by Escapades in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapades-apartment-1145,0,"A group of 8 of us tackled escape room, Apartment 1145 on New Year's Eve as a way to kick off the evening right. Great decision! Joe at Escapades was very helpful and easy to work with. He clearly explained just enough about the room for us to get started. We had some experienced and some newbies alike and escaped! I thought 8 people was a good amount for this particular room. Anymore might have felt cramped. So many laughs and definitely a night to remember!"

And were able to escape with only 3 mins to spare. Clues were challenging but not so hard that you felt like giving up.
