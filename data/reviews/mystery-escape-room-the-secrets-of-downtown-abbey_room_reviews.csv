"Escape room ""The Secrets of Downton Abbey"" by Mystery Escape Room in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/mystery-escape-room-the-secrets-of-downtown-abbey,0,"We had a great time, the service was great, and the host for the beta testing Downton Abbey Escape room was amazing! Iâ€™m not sure what his name was but I wanted to write this review to rave about him. We visited July 5th at 9pm. Props to that guy, he made the experience as good as it could be, stayed in character, and had a super friendly demeanor."
