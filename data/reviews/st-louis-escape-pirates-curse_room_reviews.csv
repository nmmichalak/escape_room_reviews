The props in the Pirates Curse room(s) were top of the line. This was the 3rd room I've been to, and by far my favorite! My heart was racing the last couple minutes while we scrambled to try to get out. We made it with just 3 minutes to spare. I would highly recommend this place and we definitely want to check out the other rooms when we visit St. Louis next time. The signs and the props at the end were fun to take our victory picture with!"
