The owners and employees are friendly and inviting. The rooms are very well thought out and challenging. My tweens found plenty that they could do making it enjoyable for the whole family. We are not new to breakout rooms and from our experience, Escape LOL has our vote for favorite."
"Escape room ""Prison Escape"" by Escape LOL in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-lol-prison-escape,3,I have quickly become an escape room junkie and I was very impressed with Escape LOL. The level of detail and creativity made the prison break room both challenging and interesting. The storyline was great and the staff clearly love what they do. The staff take pride in the experience they have created and are most interested in how much fun their guests have. Without a doubt the best escape room I have visited so far. I am ready to return to try the Pirate Ship room.
