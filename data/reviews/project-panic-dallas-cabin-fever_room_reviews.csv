"Escape room ""Cabin Fever"" by Project Panic Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/project-panic-dallas-cabin-fever,0,"I greatly enjoyed Cabin Fever! This was my 2nd time at Project Panic Dallas and overall again, it was a fun experience and one of my fav escape rooms to date! I went with a group of 8 which may be a big group for escape rooms but turned out the room was spacious enough and had alot of puzzles to work with these many people! The puzzles were interactive, unique, and challenging! Will def recommend Cabin Fever for large group of 6+ people!"

Really cool and unique puzzles- ones my friends and I hadn't seen before. The room itself is also really well made and very cool inside. Would definitely recommend! Would love to go back as they open new rooms!!"

The cabin fever room was awesome - coolest escape room layout I’ve seen so far. The puzzles were good and definitely required teamwork. I really liked it and would absolutely recommend it! The other rooms they’re developing look really neat too.
