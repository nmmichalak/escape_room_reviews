It may look small on the outside but they'll take you to the back where the game is actually at. Puzzles are challenging and some require patience.

I played the Lost Kingdom and the Treasury of Empire: Allies before. I was here to take the challenge for the Treasury of Empire again. Since I played the Treasury of Empire: Allies, I knew that this time would not be an easy game. Although this time was still for the theme room the Treasury of Empire, the puzzles were totally different due to the different story line. The agent side was differently in the room, puzzles, and clues. On this sides, it had more electronic stuffs. It made the game to be more interesting. Also, I like the idea of the telephone. It made me feel like I was in a real base try to get the secrete code. I love it! Still the great experience."

I love puzzles in the room. I played the Treasury of Empire: Agent in a 6-people group. We picked the most difficult one. And we still made it! More people with great team work will definitely higher helpful!Before the game started, the game master introduced the background story to us. In fact, all three rooms in this store are all connected together. I believe we should started with the first part of story to see the whole story. With the brief introduction from the game master, we knew that we have traveled back to WWII time and trying to get out of this military base. With this story introduction, we have had the idea about why we are here and what we are looking for. I believe that introduce is very important. Also, he told us many tips and rules.Generally, this is a great escape room experience. Although the game is not easy, we still enjoy the game very much. I like this type of challenge!"
