"Escape room ""Mad Hatter"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-mad-hatter,0,By far the best escape room venue in the valley. We did the Mad Hatter room and it was so gorgeously decorated. It was challenging and the puzzles were so creative. I can't wait to try out all their other rooms.

It was definitely challenging but very fast paced and fun. Loved the decor. We loved it so much we did the runestones one right after. That one was fun too, but we preferred the mad hatter because it was more exciting."
