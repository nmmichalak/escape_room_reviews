"Escape room ""Timescape"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-timescape,0,"We played TimeScape and had an absolute blast! The staff and cluemaster were excellent and the scenario was well-designed, clever, and filled with surprises. I've done many escape rooms and highly recommend this scenario (even though we were close we didn't beat it... but the clear rate is 12% and it's super fun)!"

Having never done an escape room before, we had no idea what to expect... Epic Escape Rooms delivered a completely engrossing, thrilling, complicated and clever experience that I can't wait to try again. Thanks so much for such a great time!!!"
