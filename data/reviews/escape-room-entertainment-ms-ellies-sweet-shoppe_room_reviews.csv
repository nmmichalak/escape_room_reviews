"Escape room ""Ms. Ellie’s Sweet Shoppe"" by Escape Room Entertainment in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-room-entertainment-ms-ellies-sweet-shoppe,0,"We did the Sweet Shoppe room and it was really fun. This was my first escape room and I didn't really know what to expect, but our guide was great and helpful. I also appreciate that they had a room themed with something a little lighter and more fun than a lot of the horror/heist themed rooms I see advertised at most places. Given a choice, I'll always take the goofiest option, so this was good for us."

Best decision ever. Awesome and friendly staff. An intense and fun game. We will certainly be back.
