"Escape room ""V.I.P.E.R's Nest"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-vipers-nest,0,We had a great time! Viper Room was challenging and exciting at the same time. Will definitely be back in the future to check out the remaining 3 rooms theyâ€™ve got set up.
"Escape room ""V.I.P.E.R's Nest"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-vipers-nest,1,"As I wrote on previous reviews, we played more than 50 escape rooms over the world. We played all of the escape rooms on reno as we are from here. The rooms are really good and most of them would be in our top experiences.  At Break Through Reno, our least favorite room was Incoroptum. A little too hard for us. Vipers nest, a casino theme, was our top 2 favorites. The immersivness and puzzles were really well done. We had a blast"

We escaped w/ seconds to spare, despite the added complication, and the staff were really cool about it."
"Escape room ""V.I.P.E.R's Nest"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-vipers-nest,3,"We decided to play Vipers nest for the first time this January. The room was great and filled with many challenging yet rewarding puzzles. Our gamemaster Meta did a wonderful job of helping us when we needed her but also made the room fun and challenging. Our group of four normal guys escaped the room by the skin of our teeth! Thanks Meta and Laurel for a great experience, and thank you breakthrough Reno!We escaped with 10 seconds left!"
"Escape room ""V.I.P.E.R's Nest"" by Break Through Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/break-through-reno-vipers-nest,4,Breakthrough Reno was our first visit to an escape room. What a blast we had! The hostess was very nice and explained the game to us before we started. We knew that our group was small (just 2 of us - we could have had up to 6 in the game) and that could either work for or against us. We tried the V.I.P.E.R.'s Nest and it was challenging but fun. We will definitely visit again when in the Biggest Little City.
