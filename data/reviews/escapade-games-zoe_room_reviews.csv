"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,0,"It was me and my wife's first anniversary together and we both like horror but we had never done a escape room before, we're used to puzzle solving in games and even at work and we're not easily scared by horror attractions eather, but this, hands down was the best, we worked together ad got scared at the same time. Would recommend it to anyone."
"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,1,"I've done most of/only the horror escape rooms in the LA and Anaheim area including the Basement LA (all 4 chapters),  Mission: Darkest Hour Torture Chamber, The Hex Room, Amityville House, The Orphanage, Fright Fest, Horror Nights and even the 17th Door. The ""Zoe"" room is hands down the scariest room/attraction I've ever been in. I did not know I could even be this scared and honestly fared for my life. Keeping your group small (3 people) will make the experience even more scary. This is my number room as of now!!! "

"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,4,Excellent immersive horror experience. Not for the faint of heart! Definitely recommended for horror enthusiasts. Recommended for escape room enthusiasts who wants to see something different than your typical puzzle rooms.
"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,5,Our group of 6 had a lot of fun! It was our first escape room so I have nothing to compare it to but it definitely had our hearts pumping a few times! The puzzles were well done and the actors were committed! Well done.

This escape room is as challenging as it is terrifying. Even your toughest of friends will scream like little girls."
"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,7,"Brilliant. Truly one of the escape rooms that pushes the concept toward the potential of what it can be versus simply doing the umpteenth iteration of ""a mad scientist's lab"" or ""a spy's secret office,"" etc. This room is smart, well-planned, and forces you to perform under exciting pressure unique to the minds of its creators. I will happily support any future rooms that Escapade dreams up."
