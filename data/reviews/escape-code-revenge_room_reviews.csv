Revenge did us in! But it was a lot of fun and very well done! If you are a novice, start with their easier rooms and if you are an expert, good luck with this one!"

We did the Revenge room, and it was a fantastic experience. They accommodated our large group for one room, even though the room was technically for six players. It was very much appreciated. The employees were great, friendly, and I loved the atmosphere."

It was our first time doing an escape room and we were not disappointed. We played in the Revenge room. Our room guide, Evan, was helpful, funny, and very encouraging! Even though we did not escape, he definitely made us feel like we did a great job. Overall and awesome experience and we will be back!"
