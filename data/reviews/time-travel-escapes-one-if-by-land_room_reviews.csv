"Escape room ""The Maker’s Morgue"" by Time Travel Escapes in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/time-travel-escapes-one-if-by-land,2,"Time Travel Escapes was a fantastic Escape Room experience! Although this was only my second time playing, I had a great time! Three of us tackled the Paul Revere themed puzzle: challenging AND rewarding, and the room setup was super-cool! Rooms within rooms within rooms!The Dawsons have put a ton of time and effort into creating a very enjoyable and rewarding Escape Room experience. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the rooms! I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys mind challenges and mental puzzles and teamwork!P.S. Our team of three crushed the room, finishing in just under an hour as the first team in over 200 who finished the room without any hints. Beat that! ;)"
