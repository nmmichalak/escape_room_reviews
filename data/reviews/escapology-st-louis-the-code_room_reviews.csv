It was the best escape experience I have ever had. We escaped with a little under 5 minutes left, thanks to our great game master. We will definitely be returning again soon. Thank you all so much for the great experience and I can’t wait to bring more of my family and friends."

We’re a puzzle-loving family so the idea of trying to figure out how to solve the issue and get out was awesome. We did TH3 COD3, and though we weren’t able to solve it, we got close and it kept us entertained, but not frustrated. We’ll be back for sure!"
