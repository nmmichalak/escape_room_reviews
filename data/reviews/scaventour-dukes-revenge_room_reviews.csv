"Escape room ""Duke's Revenge"" by Scaventour in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/scaventour-dukes-revenge,0,First time doing anything this. Had a great time and really surprised myself. Didn't even realized that I had a great physical workout as well as a mental workout. Highly recommend if you like a challenge and the outdoors. It's like the whole Escape Room phenomena done outside

Greg is a great guide and the game is a perfect way to enjoy being outside in Waikiki for an hour or so. Good for the entire family. A bit challenging at times, but Greg will help you get through all of it, and at the end we got these cool coins. I look forward to playing the other games soon."

It was really enjoyable with puzzles to solve, collaborative gameplay with your team, and a nice breath of air while taking in the sites. You will not find another experience like this on the island. I have lived here my whole life and have never really noticed some of the visuals in Waikiki till now. You will not be disappointed with this experience."
