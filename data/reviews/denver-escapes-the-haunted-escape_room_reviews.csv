"Escape room ""The Haunted Escape"" by Denver Escapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/denver-escapes-the-haunted-escape,0,"My group came to visit last week for the first time. We tried out the Haunted room. It was really fun! We have been to several Escape Rooms, some great, some good and some I would never visit again. I must say that Denver Escapes is on our visit again list! We enjoyed ourselves so much, we are looking forward to trying out the other rooms. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun night out with friends or the family."
