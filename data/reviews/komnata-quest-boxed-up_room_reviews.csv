"Escape room ""Boxed up"" by Komnata Quest in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/komnata-quest-boxed-up,0,"We then decided to try Boxed Up at the Greenpoint location, as the idea of a each being locked in a coffin seemed pretty interesting. And it was -- for a few minutes. Once the novelty wore off, we were mostly bored as there was not much for either of us to do. This room was especially disappointing because the idea is fantastic, and if done well, could have easily been one of my favorites.I've done a lot of rooms and this falls in the middle of the pack. Love that Komnata allows private rooms, but considering the number and variety of puzzles, the value just isn't that great."

This game was well planned out and was an entertaining experience. It was presented in a mysterious fashion, which added to the enjoyment. It is a fun event for couples. We are looking forward to trying a different Komnata Quest challenge."

It was scary at first because you will get locked in a box, but the staff was very responsive when we were stuck on certain parts of the puzzle. Glad I came today with my date :) Keep up the good !!!"
