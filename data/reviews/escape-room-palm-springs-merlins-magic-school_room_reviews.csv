"Escape room ""Merlin's Magic School"" by Escape Room Palm Springs in Palm Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/palm-springs/quests/escape-room-palm-springs-merlins-magic-school,0,"Whole family did the Merlin's Magic School Adventure and escaped without about 8 minutes to spare. We had SO MUCH FUN!!! This room was totally family friendly, though some of the others I would say are more adult themed(ie. Jack the Ripper)"
"Escape room ""Merlin's Magic School"" by Escape Room Palm Springs in Palm Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/palm-springs/quests/escape-room-palm-springs-merlins-magic-school,1,This was my first time experience at the escape room. My game master was K2. I must say she was extremely helpful especially when we needed it the most. We did the Merlinâ€™s room and we all loved and enjoyed every moment of it. The very best part is we solved the puzzle! Will definitely repeat! Thank you so much K2 you are the best!

We've done countless rooms all over the Denver area back home and in various cities where my family vacations. We were so impressed that we had to do a second room on our final night in town. Highly recommend this place because the puzzles are unique and challenging, and the rooms are wicked cool!"
