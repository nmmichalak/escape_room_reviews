We did the Unknown room, and the only thing I didn't like was how dark it was. We were one clue shy of escaping. Will definitely try this again!"
"Escape room ""The Unknown (Part 1)"" by ESCAPEability in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapeability-the-unknown-part-1,1,"My group and I have done our fair share of escape rooms. We did the ""Unknown Part 1"" room with a group of five and we admired the production value of the intro video - it really helped build the suspense.The room definitely made you feel like you were being held hostage somewhere. The props and puzzles in the room remained true to the theme. There were a few red herrings here and there which was a bit frustrating but thankfully we had the phone (not a walkie-talkie!) which was constantly on intercom mode so our game masters were there to jump in and help us.The locks present in this room are your typical numerical/alphanumerical/directional locks and not too much tech in this room, so veterans to escape rooms may not be too impressed. Although there were a few ""creepy"" things that may surprise or freak out certain individuals which may be a pleasant/fun surprise.Overall, pretty entertaining escape room."

It was a great time with friends, and I highly recommend for any group outings or team-building events. We already planned the next time to come back to do Part II when it opens."
