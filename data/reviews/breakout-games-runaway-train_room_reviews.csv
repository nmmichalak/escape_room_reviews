Both were challenging, but not too hard to take away from being fun. I'll definitely be going back for another game!"

We have been to escape rooms where the staff does not answer your calls, but the game masters were watching us the whole time and ready to help!"
"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-runaway-train,3,"We had decided to do the Runaway Train room. The facility does a great job of making the rooms realistic. My mother-in-law was apprehensive about being locked in a room to solve our escape. It took her less thank 10 seconds to forget her fear and become involved in trying to solve our escape. We were the first team to escape this room which had been opened about 2 weeks prior to our visit.If the facility spends the same amount of care on the rest of the rooms as it has on the Runaway Train, then this is a great place to experience an escape game."
