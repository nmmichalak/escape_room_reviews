"Escape room ""Wallingford Five"" by Quandary in New Haven",https://worldofescapes.com/new-haven/quests/quandary-wallingford-five,0,Enjoyed my first Escape room doing the Wallingford Five Room! Such a fun thing to do with a group of people! The owners are such nice people! So fun taking on different problem-solving tasks and all working together in the end to solve it! Loved it and can't wait to try another room!

We finished with 12 minutes to spare in the Wallingford Five room, the clues were clever and the solutions were fun. Our group of four was just the right size, someone was always busy working on something, maybe 5 or 6 would be OK but I think no more! Definitely coming back to try another room, fun and easy group activity and the staff are fantastic as well."

I went on a daytime double date to do the Wallingford five. We were greeted by a friendly couple who would be overseeing our game experience for the day. They were helpful in explaining how the escape room would work, making us feel at ease for the coming challenge. You could tell the time and care that the owners put into developing the rooms. Wallingford five would be a great first room for anyone curious to try a room escape for the first time, or a group with a couple rooms already under their belt. I can't wait to go back and try their other rooms."
