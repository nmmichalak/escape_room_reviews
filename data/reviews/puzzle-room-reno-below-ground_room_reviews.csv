"Escape room ""Below Ground"" by Puzzle Room Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/puzzle-room-reno-below-ground,1,Amazing room- we played with a group of 5 (which we recommend as its hard with less people). The decoration was very impressive and the room was very immersive. I highly suggest it if you are looking for a fun time with friends and like escape rooms. I believe they have it in Tahoe as well but we havenâ€™t tried it. Highly recommend

Karly's storyline for our group entering Underground was well acted. The experience was immersive and proved to be a difficult task to complete. I'm looking forward to tackling their three other rooms!

Kary and everyone else were awesome! The whole process was smooth even though we added two more people last minute. Now we want to do the rest of the rooms."
