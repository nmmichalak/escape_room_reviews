"Escape room ""Wonderland"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/square-room-escape-wonderland,1,First time here and had a great time! The lady who was our guide was top notch. Super helpful and explained everything perfectly. We manage to escape in just under 60 mins and only asked for help 4 times. The instructor said the average was 6 so we are the bomb.

Firstly, big shout out to Ryan and the team who do a great job running the place and assisting as necessary. The rooms were well-decorated and the puzzles were lots of fun to figure out as they  were varying in complexity and required out-of-the-box thinking. The group I was a part of were a part of the beta testing for this particular escape room in Anaheim and I have to say it is worth the visit!I got to participate with people with and without experience and it was great fun. I highly recommend it to those who are new to escape rooms to the ones who have some experience to give it a go!"
