"Escape room ""Clued In"" by Epic Escape Game in Cheyenne",https://worldofescapes.com/cheyenne/quests/epic-escape-game-clued-in,0,"A couple friends and I had a blast. We chose the ""Clued in"" room. We did not solve the puzzle to find out who the murderer was but it was still fun. We are going to go as soon as our schedules line up again to try the zombie room."
