"Escape room ""Escape from the Machine"" by Fort Collins Escape Room in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/fort-collins-escape-room-escape-from-the-machine,0,"This experience was so much fun!! Each room has fun clues that are just tricky enough to get you to think outside the box. Finding each clue, knowing it led to another clue, and then to another room. Trying to race the clock to complete the mission. It was exciting, and unlike any other activity you'll experience in town! I will definitely bring my friends to try it for themselves."

We had a great time! The staff is friendly and accommodating. The rooms are clean, organized and well thought-out. The clues were challenging but not ridiculously difficult. There are multiple rooms to go from one level to the next. We escaped with one minute to spare! Would highly recommend it and will go again when they start the next round!"
