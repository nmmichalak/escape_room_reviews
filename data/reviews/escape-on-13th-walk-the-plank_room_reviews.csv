"Escape room ""Walk the Plank"" by Escape On 13th in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/escape-on-13th-walk-the-plank,0,"Argh! This room made us really feel like we were on a boat (minus the seasickness) because of the in depth theming. Some puzzles were really tricky and others were just really fun! We did escape the plank and have had a great time in their facility for all of their rooms! I've done several other escape rooms, and these are the biggest games I've ever played. I like this one because of the cool olden time locks they use to keep with the theme! Great for anyone that likes Pirates of the Caribbean or just pirates in general."
