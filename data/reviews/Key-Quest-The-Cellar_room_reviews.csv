"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Modesto",https://worldofescapes.com/modesto/quests/Key-Quest-The-Cellar,0,"Horrible escape room. Attendant was unavailable to give hints, and several items/locks did not work even for the attendant. The issue is that this escape room is part of a laser quest so the focus of the attendant is divided. Sounds and music from the laser tag section breaks immersion. Would not recomend. "
