"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/Key-Quest-The-Cellar,1,We had such a great time at this Escape room.   We were a group of 9 and we were able to finish the quest in under 45 mins. Yes we did use our hints but we still figured it out. We did the room called 'The Cellar'  and it was really fun. We will be doing it again.
