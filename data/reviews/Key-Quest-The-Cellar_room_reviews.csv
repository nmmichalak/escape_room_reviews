"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Key-Quest-The-Cellar,0,"This is a work in progress but was good for the price.  The ""serial killer"" theme was well done and the puzzles are as expected for an escape room. This is in an empty birthday party room devoted for the escape room experience, and had a creepy vibe, especially given the halloween party decorations that are part of the puzzle. This location seems geared to kids, although this was slightly too scary and too hard for most children."
