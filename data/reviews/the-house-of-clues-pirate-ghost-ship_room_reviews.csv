"Escape room ""Pirate Ghost Ship"" by The House of Clues in Santa Barbara",https://worldofescapes.com/santa-barbara/quests/the-house-of-clues-pirate-ghost-ship,0,The pirate ghost ship was so much fun!  The escape room is very well-designed and quite challenging too. It's actually pretty awesome. The staff is super friendly and we're looking forward to returning.

We have done quite a few in Austin and stopped by Santa Barbara on our way home for Thanksgiving and found the House of Clues looking for something to do. The owners are set designers and spent a year building the Pirate Ghost Ship room, on top of building sets for some escape rooms back in Austin! The exit was something we've never seen before and truly unique. If we were here longer we would definitely be back to try their harder rooms."

We did both the pirate ship and the dentist office. Both rooms were engaging, challenging, witty and full of surprises (and a few minor scares!) The staff is great and makes the experience fantastic!"
"Escape room ""Pirate Ghost Ship"" by The House of Clues in Santa Barbara",https://worldofescapes.com/santa-barbara/quests/the-house-of-clues-pirate-ghost-ship,3,"The Haunted Pirate Ship was my 7th escape room and it was definitely in at least the top 2 of the ones I've done. I think what really makes this one stand out is the attention to detail on props/set decoration. The room was absolutely dripping with atmosphere - tons of fun props used in creative, surprising ways, ambient sound, and a surprisingly spacious building despite the small entrance room.The difficulty was about right, with the moderator willing to give hints when we needed them. I felt like the price was a little high for a 45-minute experience. But on the other hand, real estate in Santa Barbara is very expensive and I didn't feel let down by the experience - I would pay for it again, and am looking to come back and try out the Psycho Dentist soon!"
