"Escape room ""Escape the Titanic"" by Countdown Escape Room in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/countdown-escape-room-escape-the-titanic,0,"This was an absolutely awesome experience! We celebrated my daughter's 12th birthday doing the Titanic escape. The set up was great, the concept was keen and the amazing staff topped off the event. Scott and his crew were fantastic. This is one of the few places that dedicate the room to your party alone which also made it really fun. It's a rare thing to see 6 preteens have such a good time without electronics! We'll definitely go back and I highly recommend this particular escape room company!"

It was a blast and not just because we escaped. The staff was awesome and what's not to love about private bookings. We will definitely be back to try our luck in their other rooms!
