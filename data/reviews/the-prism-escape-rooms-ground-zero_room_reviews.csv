"Escape room ""Ground Zero"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-ground-zero,0,"This was my first ever escape room and honestly, it really got me into them. Before I always doubted spending money on doing an escape room because I believed it would be a waste, however this was actually a lot of fun! My group of three did the virus room and you are provided with as many hints as you'd like. The room was amazing in its technology and all the puzzles to solve were very creative. Overall, I'd recommend to go to this escape room and the workers here were very friendly and funny!"

Our group of 4 was entirely novice to escape rooms but we got close to finishing. I couldn't believe how clever some of the puzzles were -- like the stuff out of a movie script plot-twist. Apparently the owners are just a couple of people with day jobs that do this for fun on the side, and their passion really shines through."
"Escape room ""Ground Zero"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-ground-zero,2,This place is awesome!!! My Sister booked the Ground Zero room for today. We had 6 family members and we needed every single one of us to complete this room in the 75 minutes we were given. Before we entered the room we were told Ground Zero only had a 20% success rate. That scared us. 3 of us have never done an escape room. The rooms were decorated great. So many combination locks to open. So many things to figure out just to get to the second room. There is a 3rd small room attached to the second room. While in the 2nd/3rd rooms we only had around 18 minutes left. We started to really worry. We were all sweating to figure out that last combination to get the door open. We made it with 1:46 to spare. When that lock clicked open we all let out a huge celebratory scream. I would highly recommend The Prism Escape Rooms. I would recommend having the maximum 6 people if you choose the Ground Zero room. We all had a fun time!!
