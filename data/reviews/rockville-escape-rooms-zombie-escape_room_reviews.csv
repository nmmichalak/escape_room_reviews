"Escape room ""Zombie Escape"" by Rockville Escape Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/rockville-escape-rooms-zombie-escape,0,"Better aesthetics and sturdier construction than Pirate or Diamond Heist. Countdown clock is only available in the last room. Staff was good.The room wasn't really scary or creepy. More on par with  walking down the aisle of a Halloween store. The room had an overabundance of puzzles. Some of the puzzles are time consuming but easily solvable. Others were of reasonable difficulty for the level of the room.  Some puzzles need to solved in parallel and a larger group may help. Overall the room was disjointed. It feels like the room designer went for quantity over quality.  Some puzzles lacked any logical way to determine the solution. The game master hints were useful in those situations, but ideally the operator would add some kind of clue within the room to put the players on a logical path."
