"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Plan Georgia in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-plan-georgia-area-51,0,"Fun and challenging escape rooms! We did Substitute Teacher and Area 51, and were not disappointed with the challenges of either room. I thought it was very creative that they engineered a game suitable for younger kids so the whole family could enjoy (and it was just as enjoyable and challenging for us adults)! Thanks Escape Plan GA for the great time!"
"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Plan Georgia in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-plan-georgia-area-51,1,"We went with a group of 3 to check out the Area 51 room. This was our 1st ever escape room experience and it did not disappoint. When we arrived we were greated by Grace (who was also our game master for the room) and asked to sign the typical ""dont sue us waiver"" . Once that was handled there was a short safety video and away we went. We were lead to our room and presented with a short introduction video which set the theme for the room and the game. After that the clock started and the game was on! I wont spoil anything but we barely made it out...it was super fun. A very good mix of brain teasers and puzzles and red herrings. Once we completed our adventure we were walked out to the photo area to discuss the room and take our victory photo! We will absolutely be returning again soon to try a different room :)"
