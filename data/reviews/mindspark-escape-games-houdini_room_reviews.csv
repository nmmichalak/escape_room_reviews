"Escape room ""Houdini"" by Mindspark Escape Games in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/mindspark-escape-games-houdini,0,"I had never done this before, so l didn't know what to expect. What l found was an intricate and challenging game. Whoever designed it paid a lot of attention to detail and made sure all the props are authentic and cool. The actress Mindy was especially impressive, completely immersed in her character and very well researched."

The decor and theming were amazing! We've done nearly 25 rooms and these rooms were among the best! The customer service was fantastic as well! Our game master was great and very helpful! The live actor in the Houdini room was also really great! Very sweet and super helpful! We really enjoyed our time and would highly recommend Mind Spark Austin."
