I was a real life rebel soldier disguised as a Storm Trooper!  Along with my three friends we infiltrated an imperial base and shot our way out!  It was amazing, I only wished it were longer.  Wow so much fun!"

We did the Star Wars one since my mister is a Star Wars nerd. This was our first experience and it was trippy and took some getting used to. (I accidentally shot my gun as soon as I picked it up haha) Wouldn't recommend doing this after a bunch of drinks (hey it's Vegas.) The woman that led our tour was professional and fun. I loved that they only charged $10 for a digital photo so we were all able to get a copy without paying an absurd amount like most other places that take a photo. Looking forward to them opening a place near SF."

The experience last about 20 minutes including check in and gear check. You feel like you are in the star war movie shooting getting shot at on the ship!!! It is a 3D experience that is awesome!!!
