The staff was friendly and professional and the actual room was amazing. I will definitely do again when I come back to Cleveland. The Death Row escape room was challenging and fun. Although we didn't make it out, the experience was amazing."

We did ""the Cell"" room with a group of 7...2 adults and 5 kids (ages 10 through 14) and we all had a blast! We didn't make it out...but it was so challenging and fun to find the clues and work TOGETHER to solve the puzzles. Worth every penny! Can't wait for the next rooms to open!"
