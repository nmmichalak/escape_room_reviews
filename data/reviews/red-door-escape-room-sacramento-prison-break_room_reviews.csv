"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-prison-break,0,Went here last night to do the Prison Break room with my 2 kids (under 12) and a couple of friends. The staff was very upbeat and helpful. the room was so fun and FULL of puzzles. I believe Sandy (Sandra? SORRY) was our Game master. She did a great job.
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-prison-break,1,"Did The prison escape this weekend.  It was rated as moderately difficult.   It was our first attempt at an escape room.  We should have started with ""easy""!    With some hints from the Game Master we made it out.   Had a great time.   Next time we'll bring a few more people.  The more brains working on the challenge, the better.   My advice.....  EVERYTHING you see is part of a clue, so don't ignore anything."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-prison-break,2,Back again!!!  This time we did Prison Break. Such a fun room. Puzzles were fair and the gameplay extremely exhilarating. This is our fourth room here and we can't wait to do the 5th and get our red key. The rewards program is well worth it.
