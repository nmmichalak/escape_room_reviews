"Escape room ""Blaine's Basement"" by Escape Games AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-games-az-blaines-basement,0,"We LOVE Escape Games AZ! The staff are so friendly and personable, we've come back to do all of their rooms. We've talked to our other friends to bring different groups to try out their rooms, too.Specifically reviewing Blaine's Basement: You should definitely go in the evening when it's darker out. It definitely adds to the creepiness of the room. Unfortunately, our group did not escape Blaine's Basement (because we were so terrified of the darkness in the room). But when we told our other friends to do it, they escaped and loved it. One of our favorites rooms in all of Arizona.Definitely recommend their ""Quest for the Throne"" and ""Condo"" rooms also. Very fun puzzles and a good blend of ""locks"" and more ""technical"" triggers."
