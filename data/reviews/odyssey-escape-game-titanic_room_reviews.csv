"Escape room ""Titanic - The Final Hour"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-titanic,0,"Eleven of us boarded the Titanic and it was so much fun! We survived! We all learned things about ourselves, each other, and walked away on a mission to come back and test our teamwork skills again. Titanic is great for larger groups. The Odyssey staff and the owner, Michael, was amazing! I highly recommend visiting this tucked away gem in Alpharetta."

Totally worth the trip!"

The music, decor, games/puzzles were top of the line.  The staff and location accommodations far exceeded other such escape game businesses.  I highly recommend Odyssey Escape Game for corporate or family gatherings!  "

The team at Odyssey was so friendly, and you could tell they are passionate at what they do. We took on the Titanic room this trip, the rooms were very detailed, you could tell they took time putting them together. I really liked how they tried to keep everything historically correct, it adds another level to the experience. I'll be back for sure!"
"Escape room ""Titanic - The Final Hour"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-titanic,4,We went with a group of about 10 of us and we did the Titanic themed escape room! It was SO much fun! The whole escape room was challenging but not too difficult where you felt like giving up. This was my first escape room and I'm craving to go back and do the prison one and then the other ones as they come out. I'd highly recommend this place!!!
