The rooms are exciting, the puzzles are unique and fun, and the staff is the best around! Everyone is so friendly and enthusiastic about escape rooms which makes your experience even better! Do all of the rooms, but Convicted is a challenging necessity!"

Only one in our group had previous experience with Escape Rooms but we were ambitious. We totally underestimated the difficulty of Convicted. Very well recommended.
