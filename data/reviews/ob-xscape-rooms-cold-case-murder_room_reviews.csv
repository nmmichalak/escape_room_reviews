"Escape room ""Cold Case Murder of Dawn Renée"" by OB-Xscape Rooms in Southern Shores",https://worldofescapes.com/southern-shores/quests/ob-xscape-rooms-cold-case-murder,0,"The owners are so friendly and they did such a great job creating the rooms. We did the Cold Case Murder of Dawn Renee. The wife was so friendly and inviting and her husband even offered us extra clues at the end. We still didn’t quite figure it out. It was tough with a group of only 3 people, but definitely worth the money! I would highly recommend to anyone visiting OBX."

The rooms were well designed and the Dawn Renee Murder Mystery room was very challenging with many technological advancements as well as puzzles and locks to solve. The price was well worth the adventure. This was my first try at an escape room, and I’m definitely going to try some other rooms for sure. I look forward to the next challenge."

None of us had previously done an escape room experience. The owner was very sweet and helpful with explaining how it worked and what we should be looking for. It was a really fun challenge! We will definitely be back next year, and look forward to trying a different room. I highly recommend trying this place out. You will not be disappointed!"

No one in our group had ever done an escape room before. The owner was very friendly, walked us through the whole process, and was very encouraging. The attention to detail in the room we did was amazing. We did the Cold Case Murder of Dawn Renee. It was just the right amount of creepy and challenging. We can't wait to visit again to do another room!"
