"Escape room ""Military Bunker"" by PanIQ Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/paniq-escape-room-houston-military-bunker,1,We had a fantastic time. The puzzles were clever and required all of our 6 people to participate fully. Time went by fast but we broke out...with a few tips. Thanks Lia (game master) for a fun experience!!

We came here because we had a groupon. We did the military bunker room. There was an issue where the person giving us the clues was unsure of how to unlock one of the chests. She had to call someone for help which took about 10 minutes, but she gave us the full time back so we didn't lose any time. The only downside is the location. It wasn't hard to find street parking; however, it's in a pretty sketchy area so make sure you don't leave anything valuable in your car."
