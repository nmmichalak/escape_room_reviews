An amazing amount of detail was put into the room and it was well thought out. The puzzles were an appropriate level of difficulty - definitely made you think, but not impossible. We did this as part of a birthday celebration, and there were balloons hidden in the room with an extra clue. Keisha is awesome! Highly recommend!"
