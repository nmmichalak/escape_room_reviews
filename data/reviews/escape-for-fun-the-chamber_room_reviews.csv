"Escape room ""The Chamber"" by Escape For Fun in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-for-fun-the-chamber,0,"My husband's cousin came to visit for the weekend, and the three of us had an absolute blast in The Chamber. We joined a group of seven others, and we had a very enjoyable interaction and worked well together even though we hadn't met before. It was the first escape room adventure for all of us, but together we successfully escaped with plenty of time to spare! The puzzles were complicated and engaging; definitely a big challenge that needed all hands on deck. Thanks to Mojo for making it a great experience! We highly recommend it and plan to return!"

Super pleasant people to work with - they even accommodated us when we asked to have a party of 11 instead of the normal 10. We escaped ""The Chamber"" in 58.42 :) Would for sure recommend you visit! Thanks Escape for Fun!!"
