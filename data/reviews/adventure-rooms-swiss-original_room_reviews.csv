"Escape room ""Swiss Original"" by Adventure Rooms in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/adventure-rooms-swiss-original,0,Had a blast for an all-girls day! We did the Swiss Original room and had a lot of fun. We did not make it out but the staff was super friendly and gave us a little extra time! Will definitely return.

We only had to wait a few minutes to begin and the staff member explained everything well. It's hard to compare this to anything-the puzzles were a great mix of easy-hard, with multiple puzzles per room (3 rooms to finish). My friend and I made it 1/2 way through the last room before the we ran out of time. (We did the Swiss Original room). What was nice was the staff member at the end told us what we would have had to do to finish, so we got closure!"
