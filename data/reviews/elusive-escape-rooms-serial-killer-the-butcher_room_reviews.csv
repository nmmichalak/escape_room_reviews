The staff was kind and beyond helpful, we had Skylar as our game master loved her service. I enjoyed every minute. Would recommend to anyone. I will definitely return to try out another room. We escaped from the killer just in time."

We tried escaping The Butcher but we came up one move short. So much fun and Scott was an awesome game master. Very friendly staff. We look forward to coming back.

This experience exceeded all of our expectations!! We were so close to getting out, but not getting out did nothing to lessen the fun level! The puzzles were challenging, but solvable with a little thinking power. We only jumped and squealed a couple times... Definitely a must do, if you are in the Dells!"
