Hanna was an amazing person to work with. We did The Society room is the hardest one of the 4 rooms. The room was well put together and there were some surprises we weren't expecting. We will definitely go back and do another room, hopefully Hanna will b working that day. We highly recommend Escape This."

We tried The Society and were definitely challenged. We almost made it out in time (only 2 minutes and 24 seconds too late). I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms! I would absolutely recommend Escape This to anyone who is up for a scavenger hunt-type challenge. SO. MUCH. FUN!

Not only were they super cool in accommodating a scheduling conflict, they made sure we had a good time. We chose to do the hardest room and made it out in 1:04. The staff is really easy going and they do all they can to make the experience fun and memorable. I highly recommend this as a family or team building activity!"
