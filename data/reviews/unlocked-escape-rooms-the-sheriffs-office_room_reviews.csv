"Escape room ""The Sheriff's Office"" by Unlocked Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/unlocked-escape-rooms-the-sheriffs-office,0,Great place for some group fun. Family or friends. We did the Sheriff's Office. Went through most the puzzles fast but the last one stumped us. We were so close! We will definitely be returning.

Gary the host was awesome! Both before we entered, and during the escape. Very clever, and cool things inside. We did the Sheriffs Office. My kids and I had a blast. We will be coming back for sure with a larger group for the other rooms."

I took my 2 teenage grandkids to Unlocked. They had done a couple of Escape rooms, but were really excited that they were going to do another one. We did the Sheriff room and couldn't stop talking about it after we were finished. This is a really great activity for all ages. My only suggestion is to have more than 3 people. We will be back to do the other rooms. HAVE FUN !!!!"
