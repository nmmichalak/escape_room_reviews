"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by A Game of Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/a-game-of-rooms-prison-break,0,"Game masters are great and look like they're having as much fun as we are. No countdown clock in room. One of the better waiting rooms we've been visited. Well constructed room and good aesthetics. This is most difficult room at the site. A good variety of puzzles, with lots of stuff to do in parallel. A lot of fun."
