"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-spellbound,0,We did the Spellbound room and it was really fun. No one will be bored at any point as there were a lot of puzzles. There are also a lot of locks but the puzzles to find the codes are varied. The best part was our game master. He was really nice and fun. Amazing energy. Definitely recommend checking it out.

I have done 4 other ones, but for the rest of the group, it was their first. We were on the last clue when time ran out, but my friends had such a good time that we'll definitely be back. The clues were very thorough, interactive and seemed to be well thought out. This is a great family-friendly room as well."

The decor/ambiance is really good and the puzzles are both fun and challenging.  It is different than other escape rooms that I've done in the past in that there are several objectives you are trying to complete, it's not the typical solving one puzzle leads to the next, leads to the next until you're free.  Because of the way it is structured, doing it with strangers is fine because they can be working on one puzzle while you work on another and if they find a clue for you or you find one of theirs you can share information, but multiple objectives can be getting done at the same time.  It was easy to get tickets and book through their online system and the guy who co-owns it was really nice and helpful. The building they chose for the location is great because it is on a rooftop and there is EASY parking in the back."
