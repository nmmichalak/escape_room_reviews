I am being a hater because the vacation vandals is HARD. It was a lot of fun but disappointed we couldn't solve it. We got about 3/4 done and got stuck. We probably should have asked for help sooner. We wanted to solve it on our own so we didn't call for a help clue till we were down to 15 minutes and by then it was too late we didn't have enough time to finish. But all the workers were super nice and the boys had fun doing a few games of laser tag beforehand. I will check back here seeing if anyone has solved it though.
