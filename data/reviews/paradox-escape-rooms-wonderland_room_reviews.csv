"Escape room ""Wonderland"" by Symbology Escape Rooms in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paradox-escape-rooms-wonderland,0,"Wonderland is an escape room with creative puzzles and generic lock & key mechanics. It's low tech, but I had a lot of fun here. The multiple, nonlinear puzzles was probably the best part. The decor was definitely immersive and a treat to see."
"Escape room ""Wonderland"" by Symbology Escape Rooms in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paradox-escape-rooms-wonderland,1,"The Paradox Escape Room for the Wonderland puzzle room was a really great interactive escape room with lots of puzzles to solve! Many locks, keys, and puzzles are involved which were very well themed to Alice in Wonderland.  The room was definitely a good amount of puzzles for even a large group of people, and it would likely be needed to have at least 5 or 6 people to succeed the room with good probability- I saw some pictures that two people could do this but wow I am amazed at that :)"

I adored this place with its adorable story line and personable host.Our team consisted of four close friends (including myself) and two strangers (whom we got to know throughout the game), so six in total! Everyone played a crucial role in solving the puzzle.Tip for advanced players: This is a good challenge to do without any hints and about 4 players.Tip for beginners: They give 5 hints maximum, so use them wisely. I would recommend 8 people: the more brain power, the better!I would recommend this place to everyone."
