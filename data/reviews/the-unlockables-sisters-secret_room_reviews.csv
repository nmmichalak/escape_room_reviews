"Escape room ""Sister's Secret"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-sisters-secret,0,"My previous review was for The Escape (a great room). Now that I've done Sister's Secret, I have to say it's my favorite room I've ever done. Out of 54 rooms, this one was the most immersive I've experienced. Edwin, the owner, has an attention to detail, high quality puzzles, and intriguing story line that all come together perfectly in this room. I was scared, but not to the point where puzzles couldn't be completed. There's just the right amount of cool tech in the room, and it all added to the spooky theme. I'm also a sucker for a story - if you pay attention you will be carried through a movie like storyline from beginning to end. A cool bonus is the lobby has a mini escape room practice game. I highly recommend The Unlockables!"

Staff was super friendly and great at moderating the experience. We tried Sister's Secret- we didn't succeed, but the room was really detailed and well done!I would recommend not doing this room if it's your first time, since it's a little more complicated than The Escape or Informant. I'm going back to try an easier room for the ego boost :)"
"Escape room ""Sister's Secret"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-sisters-secret,2,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon.  My crew and I love escape rooms so this is not our first rodeo.  Place has 3 room, two of them sister secret and the escape are a bit more advanced and technologically involved.  The last one is more of your traditional escape room.  We did sister's secret and it was one of the better escape rooms in terms of atmosphere, challenge and puzzle flow.  For this room you need atleast 3 people and i'd recommend more if some of the people aren't that experienced.  Puzzle complexity is average and they all make sense.  Its perfect for larger groups since it is non-linear (something they tell you at the beginning) so you can all work of different things at the same time.  There are a lot of things to do in this room so its going to be hard if your team doesn't have multiple competent people.The atmosphere of the room is great.  Nice spooky ambience with a few things that go bump in the night.  Really a nice immersive experience with a bunch of fun puzzles."
