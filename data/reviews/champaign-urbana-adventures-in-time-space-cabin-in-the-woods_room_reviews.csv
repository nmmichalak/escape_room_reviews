It was more than I had hoped. It was challenging, exciting, and an all-around great time. The staff is incredibly helpful and also have a great sense of humor. I can't wait to try all the other adventures."

That was amazing. Seriously. Five of us took on The Cabin and survived with 6 minutes left but it was nuts. So much fun. It was such a challenge, but moved along very well. 10/10, would recommend to literally anyone, and will totally be back to rock more games!"

My coworkers/wife and I did The Cabin. It was exciting with just the right amount of challenge from beginning to end. The room and staff were awesome. My wife already booked another go round next week, and I am going back with my team next Sunday!"

Lots of creative clues, high production value, opportunities for teamwork and a sense of satisfaction when you figure out how to reach the next portion. A pretty unique little place. We're back as soon as there's more scenarios available!"
