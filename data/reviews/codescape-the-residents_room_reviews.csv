"Escape room ""The Residents"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-the-residents,1,"Went to Codescape with two friends and we played 'The Resident.' This is my 10th room, and my favorite so far! The room was amazingly set up, and the flow of the game was tricky but very exciting! The owner, Alan, was amazing and walked us through the rest of the room. I would recommend Codescape to anyone who is looking for a room that puts you into the scene!"
"Escape room ""The Residents"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-the-residents,2,My daughter and I did Deep Space and the Residents yesterday while we were in Charlotte. Challenging with just two of us in Deep Space we had a blast. The staff were great and helped us when needed. We had six people in the Residents which was plenty. Very creepy and not so linear but we loved it and can't wait to go back.

This was our first time doing an escape room but we made it to the last room before getting to exit. You have to really think outside the box. I definitely want to go again to do another room. We did ""The Residents"". I recommend codescape!"
