"Escape room ""Nightmare at The Museum"" by Room to Escape in Fort Wayne",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-wayne/quests/Room-to-Escape-Nightmare-at-The-Museum,0," My parents (retired) & I played the museum today while I was home for a visit from Los Angeles and had a fun time. It's a creative, logical game that uses mostly standard style locks and some searching. The story is well thought out.  The decor is good. The staff is wonderful! They have amazing customer service.I've played many rooms nationwide and this is a solid, fun game. I've played one other company in Fort Wayne and I'd definitely recommend Room to Escape over the other company...hands down!"
