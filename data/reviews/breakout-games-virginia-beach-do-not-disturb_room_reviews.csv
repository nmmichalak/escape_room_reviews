Our game master made sure to give us hints that led us in the right direction without giving too much away. We'll definitely return to do the other rooms!"

This was our third attempt at an escape room with the first two attempts, in different cities, being failures. George was our game master and he was super friendly and funny. He fed us clues at just the right time and only helped us a tad. Do Not Disturb was complex as most of the games are but was also creepy as the bad character spoke to our group several times throughout the 1 hour timeline. It was a little unnerving but really added to the total experience. In the end we barely escaped with just 2 minutes, 58 seconds remaining. We look forward to our next trip to VA Beach and will visit Breakout again!"
