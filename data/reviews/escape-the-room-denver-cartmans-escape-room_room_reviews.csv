Puzzles were challenging and fun.  We didn't escape but many giggles were had along the way.  Room was wheelchair accessible and was able to be easily maneuvered around the room.  It was definitely a fun way to spend an afternoon with friends.  Knowledge of the show wasn't necessary for the puzzles.
