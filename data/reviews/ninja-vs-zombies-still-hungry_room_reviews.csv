"Escape room ""Trapped in a Room with a Zombie: Still Hungry"" by Ninja Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/ninja-vs-zombies-still-hungry,0,"This was the most fun I have had in a while. Nicole was amazing from the beginning, always in character and already helping us break the ice with the people we didn't know. She was a lot of fun and very good at staying in character. The zombie was a blast too I think he was played by Vince. I interacted with him a lot to keep him away from my teammates. I am looking forward to going to more of these! "

Our team worked together extremely well to solve all the clues, and we literally had the key in the lock to the door to head outside when the timer reached zero. Two more seconds and we could have escaped! "
"Escape room ""Trapped in a Room with a Zombie: Still Hungry"" by Ninja Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/ninja-vs-zombies-still-hungry,2,"Had a great time solving ""Still Hungry"".Erin and Emily were great (can't give more details about the game itself, so small gist about our experience). As the Doctor's assistant Erin helped us with very clever hints and made the game more exciting as it is very easy to get lost in these puzzles. Emily is a great actor and did give us chills in the process. Definitely recommended if you're looking for something fun and challenging!"
