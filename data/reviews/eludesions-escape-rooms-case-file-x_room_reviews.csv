Very high production value with a mix of unique and interesting concepts. We only tried case files X and definitely coming back for more rooms as they open up in the future!

I can honesty say this is the best escape room facility we've ever been to! The level of intricacy and technologically advanced clues was outstanding. Our cluemaster was excellent in giving clues when we needed them. We were able to make it out and had an excellent time!! I highly recommend this place and we will definitely be back."
"Escape room ""Case File: X"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-case-file-x,2,This was sooo fun! My boyfriend and I went to the Case File X room. It was just the two of us and we made it out with a few minutes to spare (thanks to the hints). Pretty cool and intricate puzzles. The staff was amazing and very friendly even at 11:30PM when we left. Great set up and i highly recommend this place for groups or even just two people! We both enjoyed it very much and are planning our return to a different room.
