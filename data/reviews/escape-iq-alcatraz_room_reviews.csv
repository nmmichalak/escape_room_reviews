The Ragole's finished with 3 minutes to spare.When we started I was thinking What the heck are we doing.But as we started to work with our team, it all came together.Can't wait for the next room."
"Escape room ""Alcatraz"" by EscapeIQ in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-iq-alcatraz,2,"This escape game was so much fun!! When we got to the place (walking distance from angel city brewery I might add) we were greeted by the owner who was very energetic and excited to get us started. I definitely don't want to give anything away to anyone that hasn't played an escape game, but this was not my first experience with interactive escape puzzles and I can confidently say it was my favorite that I've played.The Alcatraz theme was very well thought out and and after a short briefing of the rules and laying of the settings, our group was in for an intense ride. Our group managed to escape with just minutes to spare only adding to the build up of anxiety of being trapped for life.The owner had mentioned adding another game into the mix in the coming future. He mentioned something about a Bank, so I can't wait until this one opens to play. If you are ever looking for a team building event I would highly recommend this place to any group (or works as a fun date night gentlemen). Had so much fun and it's been the talk at my work for the past week."
