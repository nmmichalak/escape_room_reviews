"Escape room ""The Tomb"" by Bates Motel Escape Rooms in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/bates-motel-escape-rooms-the-tomb,0,We did the tomb room and absolutely loved it. It was a great mystery and a challenge. Our tablet froze and messed up our time but otherwise it was great.

We did The Tomb with a group of 10 women for a ladies night out. We've been doing the Bates Haunted Hayride/House/Corn Maze for years and wanted to try something new. We had such a fun time! The rooms, along with the props and d√©cor were amazingly authentic! A lot of thought and imagination went into our escape room, so kudos to the staff! You really have to work together as a team to solve the different puzzles and figure out all the clues, therefore everyone contributed in some way. This is perfect for families, work groups, team building, ladies night, couples, the list goes on. Can't wait to come back again to try The Bate Manor!!"
