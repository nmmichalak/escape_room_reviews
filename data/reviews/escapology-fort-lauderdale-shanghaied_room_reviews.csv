"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-shanghaied,2,These escape rooms are well set up and fun. The experience is enhanced by all the time and effort to detail that you can see when you play the game. Our team played 2 rooms that were excellent. I would recommend Escapology to anyone who wants a challenging and fun night out.
