I loved the high energy and tense environment that set the stage for trying to escape the room. My team did the room dealing with a bank robbery and it was a blast. The personnel overseeing my group, Kandice, was a breath of fresh air and she had great energy as well. I will definitely be attending again!"

Decided to take my grands to the Escape Room and we really had a ball. I like how realistic the rooms were set up. We did the Bank Heist and it looked very similar to a bank, teller windows vault and all. Great experience!!!"

But sadly, missed by just a couple clues! It was a great family bonding game and I highly recommend it! Masterminds was well organized & gave clear concise information on how to play for those who have never played before! Can't wait to go back and try it again!!"
