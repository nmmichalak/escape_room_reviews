"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/breakout-games-lexington-runaway-train,0,"This was my third escape room and my first with Breakout in Kentucky. It was such a blast! The props in there are excellent and the story line and game play is great! I will say that it was a little easier than the ones I’ve done in the past for the fact that, although the hints get more vague the more you ask, you do have unlimited questions. The companies I’ve played with in the past charge you 2 minutes per hint. We did breakout of the runaway train and had an awesome time doing it!"

Took 14 people for a management retreat. Two rooms. I was in the runaway train room it was awesome. The employees were fantastic. We had zack as our host, I can't recall the others name. Great time.
