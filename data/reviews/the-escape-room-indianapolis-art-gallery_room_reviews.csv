"Escape room ""Art Gallery"" by The Escape Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/the-escape-room-indianapolis-art-gallery,0,Art Gallery is the first room my wife and I attempted at this location. Art Gallery has a great blend of challenges and is one of the best rooms we have played. Vicky our host was great by not guiding us but still informing us of the right things at the right time. We strongly recommend this room.

My wife and I were paired with another couple, and we had such a blast. The room we had (Art Gallery) was sufficiently tricky without being TOO difficult. And our room coach was wonderful. Can't say enough good things about our experience here."

We locked 8 type A personalities in the art room and survived. And we escaped. It is the thing to do downtown. I rate this a strong ten. A couple of things the owners need to do. Put another 4-5 pieces of furniture in each room and 10 more other objects. It was to easy to hone in on the clues, there needs to be a lot more false items to explore. Great job though, we all loved it"
