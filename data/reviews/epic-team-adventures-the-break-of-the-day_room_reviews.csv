"Escape room ""The Break of Day"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-break-of-the-day,0,"Great room escape!  We played The Vault of the Volcano God: Break of Day.  Good theme-ing and fun puzzles. We had a group of 8 people, and the room we did would be a little tight for 10. The best part of this room escape over others in the area is that everyone will be able to contribute, in parallel, and there are many degrees of success.  No one will feel left out. In general the puzzles were more abstract than physical, but it was well paced and the difficulty was right for a broad range of abilities."

I'm not really a ""gamer"" but I love to solve riddles and challenges so I wasn't sure what to expect. Needless to say ETA exceeded my expectations...what a freakin' blast! Matt was our ""guide"" and he was awesome. Oh...and we solved the mystery! Will go back. Will recommend to friends. Well done ETA!"

We live in CO and this place puts all of the escape rooms we've done there to shame. It's more than obvious that ETA has done their homework and made the investment in the ambiance of their rooms! We highly recommend that you check them out, you won't be disappointed! If we lived in Seattle, we'd definitely get a membership and try all of their rooms!"
