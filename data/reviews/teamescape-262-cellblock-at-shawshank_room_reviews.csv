"Escape room ""Cellblock at Shawshank"" by TeamEscape 262 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/teamescape-262-cellblock-at-shawshank,0,"With kids ages 16, 21, and 25, it's sometimes hard to find things we can all enjoy together. We are a loud, stubborn and egotistical family. Our family, and the older kids significant others, escaped the Cellblock at Shawshank! This brought out the best in each of us and the need to listen and cooperate, skills we aren't very good at. We are already looking for an excuse and a date to get Shipwrecked!"
