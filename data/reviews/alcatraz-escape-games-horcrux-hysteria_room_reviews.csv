"Escape room ""Wizard Hysteria"" by Alcatraz Escape Games in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/alcatraz-escape-games-horcrux-hysteria,0,"This is definitely a “ must see” if you love escape rooms! It definitely felt like you were in the Wizarding world of Harry Potter and Ian, our game master, was awesome! As chaotic as it can get at times he was on point with the clues and even cheering us on at times. Will definitely be going back to escape the zombie apocalypse."

Heard a lot about escape rooms and this was the first one we actually did. If others are anything like this, I'm all in. We did the Horcrux Hysteria (Harry Potter theme) and it was awesome! Took 5 moderately intelligent adults almost the entire hour to work our way out. So challenging but a ton of fun. The guys that work there are really nice very accommodating, and the location is great. Great with friends tonight and will bring my teams back for work activities. Excited to come back!"

Horcrux Hysteria was incredibly well done. The room was very immersive and creative. Highly recommended for a group date night!
