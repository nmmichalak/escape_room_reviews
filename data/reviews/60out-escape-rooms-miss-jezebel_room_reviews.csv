"Escape room ""Miss Jezebel"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-miss-jezebel,0,"So fun! Just finished the escape room with Miss Jezebel and it was great. This was my first time doing an escape room and I'd definitely recommend it. It wasn't too many puzzles to solve- more of a mystery theatre situation. Our ""Miss Jezebel,"" Heather, was fantastic too. 5 stars."
