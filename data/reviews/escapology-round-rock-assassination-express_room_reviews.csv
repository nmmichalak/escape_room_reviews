"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/escapology-round-rock-assassination-express,0,"We signed up for Under Pressure, this location's hardest room due to us having done numerous escape rooms across the US and breaking out of the majority of them. You are usually given a few clues to help you along in any room. The few times we had asked for clues it took a considerable amount of time for the game guide to get back with us. A part of the room was not properly described which threw us off. We ended up not breaking out which was no big deal. After the fact we decided to call back just to verify something was not mentioned and the owner was kind enough to let us try one of their other rooms since we had a bad experience on the first room.We started the second room trying to give them the benefit of the doubt and ignore any small mistakes in the experience.  Any time we had asked for a clue the guide had no idea where we were at in the process. This I believe Is due to being understaffed. At one point we had asked for a clue and the guide told us to do something completely different than it needed to be done. After several attempt at completing it the way we were told, we asked the guide for more help. Again he told us the same information. We proceeded to attempt several times before asking a third time. At this time the game guide realised that he had given us false information costing us 5-8 minutes of attempting the wrong thing. We finally go to the last step and could not get the door open. We asked twice over the course of 5 minutes for help and he finally told us that the door is hard to open. (You seriously have to pull the door hard to open it...) Something that should be fixed or at least stated before you enter the room. Then after we got out nobody greeted us at the door? We had to walk back to the lobby and ask if that was all, generally you greeted by your game guide who says congratulations and what not. We were not given a compensated time for the door not working. Overall it seems as if they are trying to cut corners with money by only have 2-3 employees working between the lobby and 5 escape rooms in total. They also don't seem to want to fix broken things in their rooms. Hopefully they can get these things fixed in the future, but until then I would steer clear of this escape facility."

We did the ""Assassination Express"" and had an absolute blast solving the puzzles as a group. This family operated place is nicely appointed with a beautiful lobby and very friendly staff. The room we played was very well done with state of the art locks, clues, and props. I'm assuming the other four rooms are equally well done. A fifth is in the works. We will definitely come back and do the other rooms."
