"Escape room ""Criminal Capture - the Zodiac Killer"" by Axxiom Escape Rooms Wilmington in Wilmington (DE)",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington-de/quests/axxiom-escape-rooms-wilmington-criminal-capture,0,"We had high hopes for this room. We frequent many escape rooms and had recently visited the Newark,DE location and were really impressed with how elaborate their Sorcerer Quest room was. So we were somewhat disappointed with the design and sophistication of the Zodiac room. The premise was not very well laid out by the game master. And yes, the room was very hard. But definitely not ""scary."" Overall just felt like it could have been done better. At the end of the night, it was just ""okay"" as far as escape rooms go."
"Escape room ""Criminal Capture - the Zodiac Killer"" by Axxiom Escape Rooms Wilmington in Wilmington (DE)",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington-de/quests/axxiom-escape-rooms-wilmington-criminal-capture,1,Ton of fun. We did The Zodiac Killer and it's definitely a challenge but I will absolutely be going again!

Lots of challenging yet exciting mysteries to solve. We will be returning for sure!!"
