"Escape room ""La Résistance"" by Escapeocity in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapeocity-la-resistance,0,This place is awesome!! My first Escape Room and It was a great time. Very clean and staff is super friendly. We did La Resistance and were able to escape. Very well thought out. Highly recommend this for a fun night doing something different.
"Escape room ""La Résistance"" by Escapeocity in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapeocity-la-resistance,1,"My best escape room experience yet. My friends and I did the La Resistance room -- very well designed room, and very well kept facility in general. Things ran very smoothly, staff were very friendly (shout out to Morgan, our group's ""Mission Control""), and we came away having a blast. The puzzles are challenging but not unfair (though the precision required on one bit started out a little iffy...no spoilers here though...:D), and the atmosphere was great. My friends and I were discussing the creativity in the puzzle design long after we were done.If you're at all into challenging escape rooms, check this place out!"

Trying to figure out what was a clue and what wasn't really threw us. But, with just 2 people, we made it through and saved the day! I thought there was a great use of space and the staff we encountered was very friendly and informative!"
