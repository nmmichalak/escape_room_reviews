"Escape room ""The Storykeeper"" by Locurio in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/locurio-the-storykeeper,0,We loved the Storykeeper room! Four of us (three who had not done an escape room before) managed to escape just in the nick of time. We loved the original and varied puzzles. I have done several others in different cities and this was by far the best.

The use of space to create different environments, and the integration of the actor into the story really took it to the next level.The puzzles were good. Not the easiest or the hardest I've seen but they were clever and at a good level of difficulty to keep the story moving.I can't emphasize enough how impressed I was with the different environments and how they were used. I really felt transported into the story.Thanks!"
