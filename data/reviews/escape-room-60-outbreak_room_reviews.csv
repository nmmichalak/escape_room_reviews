"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Escape Room 60 in Burlington",https://worldofescapes.com/burlington/quests/escape-room-60-outbreak,0,My husband and I went to do the Outbreak room today with just the two of us. So fun! Escaped with four seconds to spare. We had the best gamemaster. Would love to go back and try the other two rooms!
