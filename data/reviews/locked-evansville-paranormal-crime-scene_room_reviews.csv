Evansville in Evansville",https://worldofescapes.com/evansville/quests/locked-evansville-paranormal-crime-scene,1,Went through the Paranormal Investigation room tonight. It was amazing but very challenging for only 2 people. We did not end up 'escaping' within the time limit but had loads of fun!

The room was challenging. Didn’t quite get the paranormal part in the name, but the story was developed and made for a bigger plot than the actual puzzles in the room. We didn’t finish the room or get all the clues but also didn’t know what we were supposed to be doing next. Overall good game and price, but wish it was a little more “busy” to keep our whole group going."
