"Escape room ""Child's Play"" by Break Out! in Cedar Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/cedar-rapids/quests/break-out-childs-play,0,What a fun night with friends. It was very challenging and the puzzles and clues for the most part were logical. We did Childs Play and I would suggest wearing very cool clothing and next time I will wear my portable fan because they crank the heat to the point that even the people from our group who are never warm were roasting... it did motivate us to work harder to get out. My husband who loves puzzles has still been thinking about it and how he would do it differently. Great experience!

It was challenging and a lot of fun. Great idea for our date as we had to work together and communicate ;) Great way to get out and do something during the cold months!
