"Escape room ""Nana's Study"" by Catch-22 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/catch-22-nanas-study,0,"Did Nana's Room with 3 friends and turned out great! Was most of us' first time and we managed to beat it with 33 seconds to spare. They say you only get 3 hints but they were generous and helped out just a little more and made it a lot more fun. Great employees who made it immersive. Hard to think you'd have so much fun stuck in a small room with 4 people but it was an awesome experience. Can't wait to go again soon. Good work guys, keep it up!"

This was our first Escape Room challenge and we almost managed to solve it! It was fun and challenging but not frustratingly so. (And when we did get a little frustrated we got clues.) The room for the Nana challenge is very small, we had four and I wouldn't have wanted any more than that. Can't wait to go back!"

Might have to come back and do the museum because it looks super cool! Brought us back to our days of watching Scooby Doo and looking for clues to solve the mystery rofl!
