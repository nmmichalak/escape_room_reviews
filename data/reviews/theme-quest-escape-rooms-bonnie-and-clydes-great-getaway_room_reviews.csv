"Escape room ""Bonnie and Clyde’s Great Getaway"" by Architect Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/theme-quest-escape-rooms-bonnie-and-clydes-great-getaway,0,"My wife and I do a lot of escape rooms and we had a lot of fun here! We did both the Bonnie and Clyde room and Houdini's Hideout with just the 2 of us, and both were entertaining. The Houdini room was quite challenging, we escaped with just under 2 minutes left. The staff here is very friendly, and this place is just going to get better as they add more rooms, we are definitely coming back to do the Orient Express room. Also, very easy street parking, and we were treated to some magic from one of the GMs!"

My boyfriend and I love doing rooms just to kill time, we booked the Bonnie and Clyde room and it was great! Puzzles were fun, original and creative. The staff and owner were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back."

This was our first ever Escape Room experience and it was amazing! We did the Bonnie and Clyde room and it was super fun. Really thought-provoking and challenging. The staff was really friendly as well. We will definitely be back.
