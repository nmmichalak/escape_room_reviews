"Escape room ""Red Alert"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-red-alert,0,"60Out did it again!! Im truly amazed by what they can do!! We just played PUTIN Bunker and we had a great time! The room had an fun theme and it felt like we were in a real bunker. The puzzles were creative and not to hard to solve. This is a great room if you are a beginner in Escape rooms! Our game master Ryan was fantastic! He was super friendly, patient, and continued to theme with us the whole time we were in the room! I recommend 60Out to everyone! I can't wait to play more rooms!"

Initially we were supposed to play Da Vinci, but when we arrived the game masters warned us that it has about a 10% escape rate. Wish we would have known that before we booked! (The website just lists it as ""hard"" so we had no idea). We were nervous since we've done a couple dozen rooms but didn't feel like we were ""experts"" in any sense, so game master Jess suggested we play Red Alert instead and we were so glad she did. The room was a perfect mix of physical puzzles, lock and key, and technology, and we never felt stressed or stuck. Jess was awesome with giving the right amount of hint without just telling you how to solve the puzzle, and we escaped with a few minutes to spare. We also talked to her for a while afterwards and got some recommendations for more 60out rooms to play. Can't wait to try them out next time I'm in LA!!"

We did the Putin bunker or ""red alert"". It was definitely not easy but we did make it out with a minute to spare. We asked for about 5-6 clues throughout our time because we were getting stumped at certain parts. We are definitely coming back...it was so fun to use our brains and teamwork. The employees were super nice too. Highly recommend!!!"
