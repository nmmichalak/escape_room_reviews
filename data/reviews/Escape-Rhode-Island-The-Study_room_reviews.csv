My friends and I had a blast trying to escape. I have done two other ""escape the room"" activities and this one was by far the most interesting and the most challenging!

We are mom, dad, 20 yr old, and 16yr old and we all had a blast. Hard to find activities that appeal to everyone. This definitely fit the bill. Fun, tricky, and well thought out puzzles. Great guys running it. We talked about it all through dinner afterwards."
