"Escape room ""Indiana Jones"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-area-51,0,My friends and I have done over 20+ escape rooms and we all agree the Area 51 escape room was a great challenging room to solve clues and puzzles.
"Escape room ""Indiana Jones"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-area-51,1,Had a great time! We've done about a half dozen escape rooms around Illinois and Ohio and this one was one of the best! Definitely recommend Area 51 room.
"Escape room ""Indiana Jones"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-area-51,2,"Very well put together rooms. Original themes. Area 51 is harder than the Sherlock room in my opinion, but both are super fun to do. The owners are very cool to deal with."
"Escape room ""Indiana Jones"" by Escape Story in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-story-area-51,3,My fiance and I booked the Area 51 room on Sunday and got out with 12 minutes and 39 seconds left. We had so much fun that we HAD to do the Sherlock Holmes room and we were not disappointed. We have done 50+ escape rooms and these are definetly in our top. We were stumped and challenged and we loved every part of it.BIG shout out to our game master Dan! He was so awesome. Can't wait for more rooms!
