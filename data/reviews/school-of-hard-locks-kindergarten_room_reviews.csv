We did the escape from kindergarten and it was a blast from beginning to end! The staff was friendly and helpful. The puzzles and clues were challenging, but doable. Every step forward was extremely rewarding and we escaped with under a minute to spare. This was an amazing way to spend an hour with friends and I highly recommend it for families and coworkers as well."

We had 4 people in our group and then they added one additional person. It was pretty challenging but we laughed the whole way through! Hoping they bring back a Halloween room because we would definitely go again!
