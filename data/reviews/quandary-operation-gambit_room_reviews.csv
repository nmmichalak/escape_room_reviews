"Escape room ""Operation: Gambit"" by Quandary in New Haven",https://worldofescapes.com/new-haven/quests/quandary-operation-gambit,0,"Their newest room The Gambit is one of the best room escapes I have ever done. It was challenging, exciting and full of surprises. The owners never disappoint with the rooms that they create, so much detail and thought is put into each room. Quandary is definitely at the top of my list for room escape recommendations."
"Escape room ""Operation: Gambit"" by Quandary in New Haven",https://worldofescapes.com/new-haven/quests/quandary-operation-gambit,1,I had no idea what I was going to. It took me a few minutes to get into the mind set of the game but once I was in I became totally immersed. We did the Gambit Room with 6 people and made it out with 33 seconds left! Talk about an adrenaline rush as the clock began to wind down. The staff was very welcoming and great to chat with about the room. If your looking for an adult night out with a few friends then give it a try. My first time will not be my last night!
