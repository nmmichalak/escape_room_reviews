Both times had a great experience, they have the best escape room set ups I have seen in Charlotte. Highly recommend it to anyone and definitely will be going back to do the other rooms."

None of us had ever done an escape room before and, of course, we chose the highest difficulty first! We got close but not close enough! Thank you to Tony & all the lovely people who made it such a great time! Highly recommend!"
