"Escape room ""The Gift"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-the-gift,0,"We had an awesome time at Red Door! It was my first escape room, and we did ""The Gift"" which was challenging and clever. Unfortunately, we didn't escape, but we had a blast! Our Gamemaster was great; he was always ready to give hints when we needed them, and even walked us through the rest of the puzzle in the last room when time was up (we were so close!) Overall, we had a great experience and I can't wait to return sometime in the near future!"
"Escape room ""The Gift"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-the-gift,1,I've been to several across the country. They have nice props and great atmosphere. Staff was great and super friendly. Eugene our game master was very nice and supportive during our game of family v family with The Gift. Interesting loyalty program that makes you want to come back for more.

This one had to be one of the best yet. The puzzles were challenging but with some head-scratching and brain power, they were a fun and welcome challenge. Friendly and efficient Game Master. Accomplished ""The Gift"" and look forward to attempting another room in the future! I would give more info, but anyone who has participated in game rooms know the mystery is the best part."
