We had a group of 4 in the mummy room and luckily scored the room to ourselves! We finished the room in 55 minutes! Chris was great and super friendly! Plus the lobby is great! They have a good amount of games in there and we were able to hang around and play them for a while. Definitely want to go back for the other rooms!
