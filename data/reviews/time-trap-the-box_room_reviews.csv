It was a fun challenge as our very first Escape Room experience. Our 12 year old, 15 year old, 20 year old and parents all contributed. Great family bonding! Go!"
"Escape room ""The Box"" by Time Trap in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/time-trap-the-box,2,I've had the absolute pleasure of being able to try both the Law Office and The Box. They were both awesome and highly recommend them both. I've done half a dozen escape rooms all over the country and The Box was up there as one of my all time favorites.The Law Office was really cool how they brought in details from the local area. I've grown up in the area and the plot involved the parks and locals. What fun!!
