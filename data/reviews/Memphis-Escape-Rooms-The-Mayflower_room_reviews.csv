"Escape room ""The Mayflower"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/Memphis-Escape-Rooms-The-Mayflower,6,"My coworkers and I were in town for a few days and decided to do The Mayflower room on a whim. We had an absolute blast. The room is well thought out and challenging. We escaped with just over two minutes left.The staff and owners that we met were all great and the customer service is top notch. After The Mayflower we spoke with Keith and told him how bummed we were that we were leaving town and wouldn't be able to do the new Carnival Asylum room. He arranged to stay open late so that we could come in and try our hand at that room. (Thanks, Keith!) We had just as much fun the second time. The storyline of the room is fun with just enough of a Halloween vibe to make it fun. Highly recommended!"
