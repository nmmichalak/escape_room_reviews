"Escape room ""Pipe Works"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-pipe-works,0,Really fun with a group of people. You are locked in a room and have to use the clues and riddles given to you in order to escape. I enjoyed it and you will too.
"Escape room ""Pipe Works"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-pipe-works,1,My daughter and I had a great time at this place.  We had so much fun solving the riddles that we went back and did another room.  We really enjoyed working with the other people to figure out the riddles and unlock the clues.  It was really fun and interesting.

The manager, Marian, who was also our gamemaster, was super nice and welcoming. We did the Pipe Works, which turned out to be a good, solid escape room. This room could be divided into 2 teams racing against each other, or as we did it, one team. This was a fun room, run by a fun staff. Marian was a great gamemaster, and she knew exactly when we needed nudges and help. (Thx, Marian!) We highly recommend this location to beginners and experienced gamers alike."
