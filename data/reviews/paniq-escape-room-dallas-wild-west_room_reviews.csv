The puzzles were challenging but not impossible. I loved the decor and ambient music. The theming was amazing, it really felt like we were outlaws in the Wild West. The staff was awesome. Ammon was very friendly and helpful. Adrienne gave wonderful hints. We will definitely be back to PanIQ"

Went in with a group of 6 for my sisters birthday and we had a blast! Ammon was very polite and funny, will definitely be coming back to try the other rooms. We did the wild Wild West it was pretty hard, and we may not have made it out without the hints we asked for! But overall a fantastic experience! AMMON IS AMAZING!"
