We all had a great time.  The whole thing was a ton of fun.  The multiple rooms, the different types of puzzles, the theme/story - was all incredible.  Most of us had never done an escape room before, so it was an excellent first experience.  Immediately upon completing the game everyone was ready to book another game.  We will definitely be back when the new room opens!"
