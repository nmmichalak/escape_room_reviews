"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/breakout-games-chattanooga-mystery-mansion,0,We took some younger kids here for a birthday experience and they absolutely loved the Haunted Mansion theme. It was pretty challenging for them but they had a blast. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

We did Mystery Mansion. There were quite a few things broken or the guy would come over the intercom, telling us that we wouldn't need something and not to touch it. The workers didn't seem to be into it at all so that didn't help us get excited. We did get out and it was fun, just not as impressed as I usually am at escape rooms. This was our first time at Breakout Games and it was my twin sister's and my birthday."
