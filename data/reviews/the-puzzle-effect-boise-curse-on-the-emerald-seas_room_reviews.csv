"Escape room ""Curse on the Emerald Seas"" by Puzzle Effect Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/the-puzzle-effect-boise-curse-on-the-emerald-seas,0,Fantastic experience from start to finish. We did the Curse of the Emerald Pearl. It was a great room production-wise and very challenging. Katy was our guide and she was enthusiastic and friendly.  Kyle was at the front desk and he made us feel welcome from when we walked in the door until we left. We even took advantage of their 20% discount if you book another room when you're done.
