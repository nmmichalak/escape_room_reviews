"Escape room ""Beyond Medusa’s Gate VR"" by VR Territory in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/vr-territory-beyond-medusas-gate,0,"This was soooooo much fun for my sons 7th Birthday. It was 10 of us, and we all had a blast. Some of us played together as groups and then left into our own games. The staff are awesome and super helpful. I LOVE that they have played the games and can help you out. It’s kind of addictive! LOL"

We came yesterday afternoon and my boys including my boyfriend were able to play right away. Nick was awesome and helped a lot. The place is located in a small strip mall. Guess what, we're back again today. The boys are having fun. Will recommend."
