"Escape room ""The New Atlantis"" by Huntsville Escape Rooms in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/huntsville-escape-rooms-the-new-atlantis,0,"My son and I played the Atlantis room and had a blast. We didn’t escape but our game host, Luke, was great and took the time to show us the last three puzzles we missed. I have played escape games at other locations and in my opinion this room had difficult but logical clues that clearly led you to the next puzzle - not all rooms are like this. My teenage son can’t wait to play at this location again!"
"Escape room ""The New Atlantis"" by Huntsville Escape Rooms in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/huntsville-escape-rooms-the-new-atlantis,1,"We recently did the New Atlantis. It is the only room we have done here since we don't live in Huntsville. We love escape rooms, probably having done about 15 in total. I am amazed that this is a local business, because it is as high a quality as many of the larger chain escape rooms. It was a really well thought out room, I would say one of my favorites of all time. It was challenging, one of the tougher rooms I have done, but with some clues and good help we escaped. We will definitely be back to try the other rooms someday. I think our game master's name was Chloe. She was fantastic. Lots of fun."

Staff was incredibly helpful and friendly, especially Miranda. The room was extremely well put together, sometimes there is just so much going on its hard to stay on track, but I thought the ""Atlantis"" themed room we completed was well thought out and creative. Would definitely come back again!"
