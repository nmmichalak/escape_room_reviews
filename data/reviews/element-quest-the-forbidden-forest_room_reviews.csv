Can’t wait to do more. If you love games, puzzles, mystery; then you just gotta go! The more people with you the better! Great game that even makes strangers work together! Awesome entertainment!"

Mike was very helpful in relating the hints. Make sure you know some jokes so you can get more hints. Great time was had by the six of us. Definitely will try another room soon.
