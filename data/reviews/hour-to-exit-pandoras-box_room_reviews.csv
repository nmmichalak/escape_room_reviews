"Escape room ""Pandora's Box"" by Hour To Exit in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hour-to-exit-pandoras-box,0,This was the first time I went to an escape room. I loved it. It was so fun. We made it with three minutes to spare. We had a party and the guy was super nice. I strongly and highly recommend.
"Escape room ""Pandora's Box"" by Hour To Exit in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hour-to-exit-pandoras-box,1,Pandora's box was ideal for our family of five. Staff was very friendly and inviting. Looking forward to going back to do Illusion!

Multiple things to work on in the room but teamwork is still key. Room was chilly but we'll take that over a steamy room any day! While Brittney, our amazing game master and owner of HTE was going over game rules, the room interacted with what she was saying which was pretty cool. Room atmosphere, decor, props, and puzzles were on point and was extremely fun. Escaped with 10 min to spare!Street parking available until 12am ($1 an hour) or in the parking lot across the street. Also, the actual entrance is on North Street! All in all, being a new escape room, it's a very nice addition to New Rochelle. Only a 20 min drive from NYC or 40 min train ride from GCT, I recommend making your way to HTE for your next escape room adventure."
