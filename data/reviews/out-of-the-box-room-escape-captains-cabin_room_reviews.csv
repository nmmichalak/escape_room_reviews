"Escape room ""Captain's Cabin"" by Out of the Box Room Escape in Princeton (WV)",https://worldofescapes.com/princeton-wv/quests/out-of-the-box-room-escape-captains-cabin,0,Out of the Box is an amazing experience and is worth the money you pay! Captains Cabin was so much fun and me and my friends did it with 2min left till we failed. If you love video games and puzzles you'll love this! Also the woman who runs this place is so nice. There is more to come from this place and I'm excited to come back!
