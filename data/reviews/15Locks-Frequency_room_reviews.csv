"Escape room ""Dead Man’s Cove"" by 15 Locks in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/15Locks-Frequency,0,Dead Man's Cove is perhaps the best room in the greater Austin area (or is at least my favorite). The amount of thought and work that went into not only the mechanics and technology of the room but the story really shows. And that's not even bringing in how you receive hints - which is awesome. I fully expect to be back in a few months to play the room again with different people.
