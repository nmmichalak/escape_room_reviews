"Escape room ""The Faberge Heist"" by Escape Room NWI in Schererville",https://worldofescapes.com/schererville/quests/escape-room-nwi-the-faberge-heist,0,We had a lot of fun solving the Fabrege Heist and were able to get out with 3 minutes to spare. This room was more difficult than the Mystery Room. Lots of fun and laughs. Looking forward to trying the new room which we were told should be open soon.

Not bragging just thought the room worked well with design. Too many favorites to pick one of the puzzles. Definitely would recommend to others.Thanks to the two ladies (Mary and Kylie) who were our hosts, we had a great time."
