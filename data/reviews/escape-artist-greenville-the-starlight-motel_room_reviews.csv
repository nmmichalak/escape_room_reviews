"Escape room ""The Starlight Motel"" by Escape Artist Greenville in Greenville",https://worldofescapes.com/greenville/quests/escape-artist-greenville-the-starlight-motel,0,"This is my new favorite. There are several rooms (not just the usual 2) with different levels of interaction. The atmosphere is great and the actors take it to the next level. Although there is regular involvement with various characters, they are not with you the entire time. It does have it's scary moments, but that is what makes it even better."
