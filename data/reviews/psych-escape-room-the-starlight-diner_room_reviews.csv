"Escape room ""The Starlight Diner"" by Psych Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/psych-escape-room-the-starlight-diner,0,"My fianc√© and I love escape rooms and this is one of our favorites in the area. We've done Sherlock Holmes, Al Capone, The Lake House, and just finished their newest, The Starlight Diner. All of the staff is amazing, willing to help out when we get stuck but without giving anything away, so you still feel the sense of accomplishment. The themes are unique and every room is so well-executed. Their rooms are great for all ages! Whether you're new to escape rooms or a seasoned veteran, I highly recommend them!"
