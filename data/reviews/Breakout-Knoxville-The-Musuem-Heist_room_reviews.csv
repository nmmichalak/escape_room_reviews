"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/Breakout-Knoxville-The-Musuem-Heist,0,"I had an amazing adventure with my son today. The scenario we were in was a museum heist of a painting. Had to go through several and more steps to solve the caper. Was very well thought out and very fun. My advice is to go with 4 people instead of 2. They have several other scenarios, we chose the more timid one. I highly recommend the experience. Very fun."

We had 20 that used 3 different rooms and themes. The team I was on did the museum heist. What a fun and great team building experience. We completed and escaped in 57 minutes. Our other two teams time expired. Our team moderator from Breakout helped make the experience more fun.(Preston) At dinner this evening all of our team members we're talking very excited about the event. #breakout
