"Escape room ""Tiki Island"" by Escape The Netherworld in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-netherworld-tiki-island,0,Tiki Island was so much fun!!! Same quality you'd expect from Netherworld but way more tame than the other rooms so even a wuss like me could enjoy it. The special effects were amazing and you really get pulled into the story of the room. My husband and I escaped with :32 left (just the two of us) with a little help from game master T who is an absolute angel. She was incredibly helpful and encouraging through our game play and genuinely wanted us to succeed. Tiki Island is definitely a challenge as there are a lot of puzzles to complete. I recommend having a group of 4 seasoned players to get out in time. A new room is opening up so we will absolutely be back!
