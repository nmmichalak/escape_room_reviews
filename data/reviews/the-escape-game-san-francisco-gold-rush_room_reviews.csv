"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-gold-rush,0,"Glad that one of our friends suggested that we try this new game room in the city and we weren't disappointed! We had an awesome time and the room was well thought out and was well made. We've tried different escape rooms in the city and so far, I would say, theirs are the best in terms of props/production. I really liked and highly recommend it. Check them out!"

Highly recommend for a group of teen boys. And if you book 7 people they give you the room to your self which was great. Room was challenging but do-able, and bonus if you do it on your bday you get a special sticker and pin!"

Great to find. Staff are amazingly helpful. We played 1 game (donâ€™t know the name of the gentleman who helped us), the staff member who walked us through everything and gave us unlimited clues (we were terrible). He even gave us an extra 3 minutes to help us complete the last puzzle. The game we played was called gold rush and was challenging but again the man who helped was great - hopefully can visit again soon!"

We completed the Gold Rush room and the decor and design of the room was fantastic. There were puzzles that I had never seen before and the detail that went into the tools/clues were awesome! The puzzles were challenging while also able to be completed with common sense. We did not need to use any clues to solve the room and that made the experience all the more immersive. Highly recommend and we'll be back to solve the other rooms soon! Tip for those visiting, 7/10 is not so challenging. My teammates and I have about 5 rooms experience on average and we completed the room in about 25min out of the hour provided. If you and your party have experience with escape rooms, you may want to aim for one of the rooms that are ranked 8-9/10 for a harder challenge."
