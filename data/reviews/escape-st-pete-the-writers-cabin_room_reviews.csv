"Escape room ""The Writer's Cabin"" by Escape St. Pete in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-st-pete-the-writers-cabin,0,Super fun experience! We did the Writer's Cabin room and I loved the murder detective plot. At first when you enter the room it appears small but it is definitely challenging! Definitely want to come back and try the other escape room.

"Escape room ""The Writer's Cabin"" by Escape St. Pete in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-st-pete-the-writers-cabin,2,"This was our fourth escape room and it was a great experience. The room itself was smaller than others we've been in, but since it only holds 4 people it wasn't super tight. We thought it was difficult, creative and fun! Would recommend to anyone looking for a fun experience in downtown St Pete!"

Fun puzzles and theming, a lot of ""discovery"" moments, and amazing customer service make this escape room a must-do if you're in the St. Pete area. I can't wait to go back and try their other room."

My husband and I did the Writer's cabin. We were really excited to find a room that was for 2-4 people. This was our third one, and was one of the better rooms weâ€™ve done. The cabin was decorated really well and the storyline was fun. Lots of very cool aspects of the investigation as well.The assistant who got us set up was great. He was really welcoming, gave us thorough instructions and got us going. We could also choose our hint delivery - whether we wanted no hints or some nudges. We highly recommend them!"
