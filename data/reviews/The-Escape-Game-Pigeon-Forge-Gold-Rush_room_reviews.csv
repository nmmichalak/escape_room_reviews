Challenging, so you really feel accomplished if you are able to escape. This is a really fun activity. We'll be back at Christmas to try the Prison Break room!"

We all loved it! The puzzles were challenging, but we all worked together and figured things out. Our group consisted of my 10-year-old daughter, my husband, my 71-year-old mother in law and me. My daughter was able to figure some things out, my mother in law really enjoyed helping, and once my husband figured out what it was all about, he really got into it as well! The hour flew by, we were so focused on the task and having such a great time! I highly recommend this!"

We were paired with great people. The Gold Mind room was elaborate with challenging, yet solvable puzzles. Thanks for a great time, we will return!"

We had a great time here and would definitely do it again. I wouldn't bring kids but it's a great idea for adults looking for something new. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room (Gold Rush) was so well thought out. Great experience!
