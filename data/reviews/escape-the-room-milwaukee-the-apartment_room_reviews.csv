"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-the-room-milwaukee-the-apartment,0,"We had a blast playing the apartment. The room was fun, difficult, but not impossible. Our guide was kind and informative. We had a group that new each other pretty well so we were able to split up and tackle multiple puzzles at a time. We had 8 in our group, it felt like having more than that may have gotten a little crowded, but we needed about 8 to get the puzzles solved in time."
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Milwaukee in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-the-room-milwaukee-the-apartment,1,We had a great time in our escape room- we did The Apartment. It was very challenging and fun and enough areas and puzzles for each person to participate. The only thing I would change was that we were in a room with other people we didn't know.

There were 4 of us and worked great!! I would definitely recommend people doing this. They gave just enough info to help. We finished in 52 mins. Can't wait to try the others!
