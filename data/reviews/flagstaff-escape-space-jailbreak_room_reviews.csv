"Escape room ""Jailbreak"" by Flagstaff Escape Space in Flagstaff",https://worldofescapes.com/flagstaff/quests/flagstaff-escape-space-jailbreak,1,"This place is awesome!!! Great quality rooms! They were so detailed and they were very challenging. We signed up for the jail break room which was crazy hard but soooo much fun I would totally recommend even if you can't make it out. We didn't and had so much fun we decided to do another room. We did the saloon room also which was awesome!!! You get unlimited hints but they make you wait at least ten min to try and work together. Great for team building. Our team, karly and Brooke, were outstanding and so helpful! They walked us through the rooms when we didn't get it and answered all questions we had. This was my first experience and it was a great one thanks t this place and these ladies!"
