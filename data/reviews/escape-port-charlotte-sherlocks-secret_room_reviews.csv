"Escape room ""Sherlock's Secret"" by Escape Port Charlotte in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-port-charlotte-sherlocks-secret,0,We had a great time visiting Port Charlotte and Escape Port Charlotte. We conquered all of the rooms but needed some help with Sherlock Holmes. The owner and her staff were awesome. They helped us when we needed it and let us figure out the riddles on our own when we showed signs of progress. I would recommend this room to anyone new to the game or those who have done other rooms. They have a perfect amount of puzzles for each room. Thanks for a great time!!
