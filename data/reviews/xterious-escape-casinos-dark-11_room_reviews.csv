"Escape room ""Casino's Dark 11"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-casinos-dark-11,0,"I've been to a hand full of escape rooms, and I gotta say this one has been one of the most challenging ones. The place has 4 rooms, to prison cells, a Science Lab room and a Las Vegas Casino themed room. I went with my coworkers as a staff event, and my group got to do the prison room and Casino room. You get 1 hour to get out of the room!! You can ask for help, but after your third hint, they add 15 seconds on your time. Overall the rooms were so much fun! Will definitely be coming again to try the Science Room, I heard that one was harder than the Casino."
"Escape room ""Casino's Dark 11"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-casinos-dark-11,1,"I did the Casino's Dark 11 room with 5 of my girlfriends for a bday party. What a fun adventure. There are a handful of different story lines that you can chose to ""escape from"", but we picked the one that sounded like a real life ""Hangover"" movie. We had ""lost"" a friend after partying and had to get her back :)I won't go into too much detail so I don't ruin the experience, but let me just say it was well organized, intricate enough that all of us were working together for the entire hour, and also challenging too. The perfect mix (and not scary!!)"

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Their rooms are all different and well put together. Definitely my favorite!
