"Escape room ""Haunted"" by Shipwrecked in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/shipwrecked-haunted,1,I Have been to the mini golf before and came in on a Monday night to come play mini golf again because it is a great place to have a fun time indoors when it's cold or rainy. Since the last time I was here they have added an whole floor of an escape room with 3 different escape rooms you can choose from. Me and my boyfriend did the haunted escape room it's called a mini escape because the rooms are smaller than a regular escape room and you are given 25 mins to complete the escape. We did not solve all the clues in time but it was still a fun experience. You can go with a group of people and split the cost but for 25 mins it was 40 dollars so if you are just going with two people it is a little pricey. I will definitely be coming back with a bigger group of people will be even more fun trying out a different room with more people.
