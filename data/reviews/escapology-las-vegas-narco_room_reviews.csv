"Escape room ""Narco"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-las-vegas-narco,0,The room Narcos was so far the best one there ! The staff is very friendly and Tiff was very sweet to let us finish the last clue even though we ran out of time she lets us finish . Definitely recommend this room for teens and adults not children but they did let us know in advance what we were expecting in the room

The lobby is nice and staff was friendly. We did the Narco room and didn't escape, but it was fun. My wife enjoyed it too."

They explained well as what to expect and they have many escape rooms with different difficulty levels.We chose 'Narco' it was one of the most difficult to escape. We were team of 3 all doing this activity for the first time. And it was fun. There are 3 rooms to escape and the helper on screen is great to Good luck to all
