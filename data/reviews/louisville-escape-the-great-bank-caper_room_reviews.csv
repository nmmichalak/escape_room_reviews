We received just enough help from our awesome host, Dominic, to challenge us but also keep us on the right track. It was a lot of fun to engage with the room and also work together!! Definitely recommend it!"
"Escape room ""The Great Bank Caper"" by Louisville Escape in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/louisville-escape-the-great-bank-caper,1,I had a great time and recommend it as a fun group activity. The staff was nice and friendly. We did the bank heist and our group was 8 people. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the room was a little small for 8 people.
