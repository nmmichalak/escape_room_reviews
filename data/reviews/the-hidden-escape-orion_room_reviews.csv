"Escape room ""Orion"" by The Hidden Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-hidden-escape-orion,0,There were four of us (adults) on a family weekend trip. We decided to try the Orion escape room and had a great time. The clues were challenging and creative. The facility is new (5 months) and designed well. We would definitely go back to try the second escape room.
