"Escape room ""TH3 C0D3"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-the-code,1,"I'm pretty active on the local escape room circuit and this place blew my mind. I fully recommend starting with Th3 C0D3; the puzzles were varied and imaginative and incorporated the perfect amount of technology to immerse you in the setting without feeling gimmicky. Escapology struck a perfect balance between puzzles that can be worked on simultaneously and independently, and puzzles that require team work. My boyfriend and I love when we can each ""do our own thing"" at times to set-up the solves, but when the game naturally guides us to reconvene to work on the more collaborative puzzles together.The staff was so fun and helpful, we already booked our next room and can't wait!"
