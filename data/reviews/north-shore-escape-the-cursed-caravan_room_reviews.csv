"Escape room ""The Cursed Caravan"" by North Shore Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/north-shore-escape-the-cursed-caravan,0,"This was a really fun Escape Room, my favorite of the ones I've done so far. The puzzles are well integrated into the setting and the story, and the level of hints given was just right. I highly recommend this Escape Room, particularly if you live in the northern suburbs of Boston!"
"Escape room ""The Cursed Caravan"" by North Shore Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/north-shore-escape-the-cursed-caravan,1,From entering the building our experience was amazing starting with our host. He was very informative and his humor and puns on point. He was very informative and explained what to expect and how to enjoy the game. His advise and information was invaluable to enjoying the game. The room was awesome we did the caravan. I must say the story was awesome. Team work is key. You must pay attention to everything and work together. Talk to each other and think aloud(his advise as well). The room is very thought out and challenging. We had a blast and under the final clicks of the clock we made it out with 1:54 sec remaining. I recommend this for everyone. Congrats N.Shore Escape you rock! - You guys made my wifeâ€™s birthday amazing. 5 stars the whole way!!!

Great puzzles, wonderful theme, excellent construction and decoration. Finally an owner/designer who really injected his sense of humor and his love of what he does into this room! Highly recommended!"
