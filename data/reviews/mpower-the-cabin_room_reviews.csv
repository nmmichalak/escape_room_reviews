"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by MPower in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/mpower-the-cabin,0,"The puzzles in this escape room are great! We did The Cabin, and there were puzzles suited to the different skills of everyone in our group. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room, and I'm looking forward to their next room opening (early 2019, I think) so that we can go back for another round!"
"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by MPower in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/mpower-the-cabin,1,"I took my entire family for fathers day and we had an amazing time trying to escape from ""The Cabin"". After nearly an hour we made it. It was such a great time because MPOWER was very cleaver in their designing of the room and all the things you needed to do to escape. I would definitely suggest you give MPOWER a try, you will not regret it."
