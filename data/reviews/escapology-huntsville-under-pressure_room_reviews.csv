"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Huntsville in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/escapology-huntsville-under-pressure,0,"We did Under Pressure. It was fun, although we didn’t finish! Our screen went black during our time so that was kind of an inconvenience, and we weren’t offered anything for it. It also would have been nice to start with a clue. We wasted over 15 minutes of our time trying to figure out where to start, and most escape rooms start you out with a clue. Overall it was fun! A little pricey Versus others, but fun!"
