"Escape room ""The Disappearance at Fogmore Manor"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/The-entrapment-at-fogmore-manor,0,"Really fun and engaging. I had only been to one other escape room and it was not so great, so I was kind of skeptical about trying another one. My husband and I did this one by ourselves. I was impressed with the thought and attention to details that went into this one. The level of difficulty was good for us but we did not manage to escape because we got stuck on one or two of the puzzles. We will go back again soon to finish it. Highly recommend. "

"Escape room ""The Disappearance at Fogmore Manor"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/The-entrapment-at-fogmore-manor,6,"I will start with a disclosure that I'm friends with the owner and have been doing puzzle races with him for more than ten years now. However, I didn't help plan or test The Entrapment. I was actually proud to be one of its first official customers. I've done a few escape rooms and always felt that the puzzles were disconnected and lacking in innovation or just so random that they weren't enjoyable...none of that applies to The Entrapment! This escape room consisted of a variety of incredibly clever puzzles (of just the right difficulty) woven together in a story that made the experience unique and challenging. I loved that that there was a theme and story for the whole experience. Each object in the room was relevant and purposeful and added ambience. This is unlike the other escape rooms I've done that seemed to be full of completely unrelated puzzles or random office supplies that were intended to be puzzles. The story helped make the puzzles solvable and kept you connected to what was going on. I LOVED all of it and I can't wait until Scott creates another room to escape from!! In the mean time, get your friends together and book a time now!!!"
