"Escape room ""Coven"" by Gone in 60 Escape Games in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/gone-in-60-coven,0,"My hubby and I did the Coven room with 6 other people that we had just met that day. We had a BLAST! We all worked together, solved the clues, and escaped the room with only 5 minutes and 58 seconds left! We will definitely be back to try the Contagion room. Be warned! It can be difficult... but fun!"
"Escape room ""Coven"" by Gone in 60 Escape Games in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/gone-in-60-coven,1,We had a great time. We were in the Coven room. Well worth the money. Definitely going to do the other room. It was fun everyone working together to figure out the clues. We didn't get the door unlocked but were very close. If you get a chance to go to this I highly recommend going!
"Escape room ""Coven"" by Gone in 60 Escape Games in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/gone-in-60-coven,2,We went as a group of friends. Only one of us had done an escape room before. We choose the Coven room. We all had a blast walking around finding clues. It was definitely fun and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys figuring out puzzles. We will definitely be coming back for more!
"Escape room ""Coven"" by Gone in 60 Escape Games in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/gone-in-60-coven,3,Coven was a good experience but I feel like it had too few puzzles in it (At least compared to the other room Contagion). It was a beautiful room and the experience was a lot of fun but I just felt like there was more that could have been done with the theme.
"Escape room ""Coven"" by Gone in 60 Escape Games in Peoria",https://worldofescapes.com/peoria/quests/gone-in-60-coven,4,"Brand new escape room in Peoria, opened a week ago. Owners were really great to chat with afterwards. We had two adults and 4 kiddos(ages 8-13) and had travelled 2 1/2 hours to get there:) The room, Coven, was set up beautifully! You could tell they really wanted the people immersed in the story. Wonderfully done. They have a couple kinks to work out, but a great time was had by all! So much fun and we will definitely be back!"
