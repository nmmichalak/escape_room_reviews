"Escape room ""Get A Clue"" by South Side Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/south-side-escape-rooms-get-a-clue,0,Ive done the cabin of dr. Bishop and just did the Clue one and it was awesome! Clue is by far my favorite escape room game!! Highly recommend. We did it with the max 12 people and it was perfect. We made it out with minutes to spare. It was so much fun and just like you are playing the game Clue.
