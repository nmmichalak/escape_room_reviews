"Escape room ""Zombie Room"" by The Great Escape Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/the-great-escape-clovis-zombie-room,0,"This was our family’s first time in an escape room and we had so much fun in the zombie room. We had no idea there was a “live” zombie in the room which made it very exciting and challenging. The puzzles and riddles were very challenging. We actually did not complete the escape, but had a blast trying. We will for sure do be back!!"
