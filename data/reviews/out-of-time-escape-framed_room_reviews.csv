"Escape room ""Framed"" by Out Of Time Escape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/out-of-time-escape-framed,1,"I have done a far share of escape rooms all over the country during different trips. Travelimg from Ohio to South Carolina, my family stopped in Mooresville for the night and decided to do an escape room. We did the framed room and it was definitely one of the best ones I've done! So many clues to find, puzzles to solve, and definitely requires true team work since 2 team members are locked up.Additionally the staff was great, helpful, and friendly! Would recommend anyone traveling through the lake Norman area to stop here for an hour of fun. We were all glad we did."
