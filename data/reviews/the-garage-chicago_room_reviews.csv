If you are looking for something totally different to do, stop here.  It takes all kinds of thinkers to make it out of the room, so don't think you have to be a genius. The staff are super nice."
"Escape room ""The Garage"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-garage-chicago,6,"We failed again! We do this for date night and talk about it daily. We tried has a couple and came close. Our second try was with ten people we didn't know. Both attempts were fun. Two times and so close, we've always left saying what if! After trying two rooms and two different experiences, we have no complaints. I'm still kicking myself for missing a step I'm sure would've given our team the extra time needed to escape! Money well spent!! If forced to make a complaint it'd be we won't have another room to solve for awhile. It's not a complaint because it's obvious it takes a lot of time to develop each room. We can't wait for the next adventure."
