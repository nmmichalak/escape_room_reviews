"Escape room ""Framed"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-framed,0,"After doing a few other escape rooms in the area, I came to room raiders for my birthday and found it to be very unique and challenging. I completed Framed, came back two nights later and did Asylym. The owners are great at explaining all the rules without giving anything away. Will definitely be back when more rooms are open."
"Escape room ""Framed"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-framed,1,"Recently went to Room Raiders to do their Framed room and we absolutely loved it. We loved it so much in fact that we decided to do the asylum room directly afterward! I have done many escape rooms both in south florida and across the country and I will say that these rooms were very well done. framed had a great set design but what i liked most about it was the puzzle flow, it was interactive and above all else FUN. You didn't get too stumped where it killed momentum but it wasn't too easy that you ran through the room, it was a clever mix of good puzzles. WIth asylum, I loved the immersion. There is something they do thst is very unique,  quite freaky but VERY cool... you will just have to play it to find out but the immersion was great and puzzles were a bit more challenging than framed was. Can't wait to check out their new room as well. Thanks guys, you rock!"

Only two of us had experienced Escape Rooms before and the others had no idea what to expect. James took the time to explain what we needed to do in the ""Framed"" room in order to escape. Once inside, we received a few clues and were able to complete the game with 17 seconds to spare! We will DEFINITELY be back to try the other rooms!"
