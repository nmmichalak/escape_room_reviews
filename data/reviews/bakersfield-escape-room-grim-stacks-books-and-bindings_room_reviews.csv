I was initially somewhat skeptical as I'm not great at puzzle solving, but it was surprisingly awesome. We did the Grim Stacks room, such a fun room. We did have 7 adults in the room and I think that it would probably be even more fun with a slightly smaller group. I can't wait to come back again with my kids next time!"
