"Escape room ""Escape Detention"" by A Game of Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/a-game-of-rooms-escape-detention,0,"Game masters are great and look like they're having as much fun as we are. No countdown clock in room. One of the better waiting rooms we've been visited. Room aesthetics are very simple, but works given the classroom theme. There are a lot of puzzles that can be done in parallel, so probably better for large groups. Would work for groups of all ages. A really fun entry level room."

We've done a number of escapes and the ""Detention Room"" was a formidable challenge. We got out with seconds to spare. Escape rooms are a great exercise for your brain!"
