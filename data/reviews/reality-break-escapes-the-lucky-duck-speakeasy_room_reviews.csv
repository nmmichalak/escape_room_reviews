"Escape room ""The Lucky Duck Speakeasy"" by Reality Break Escapes in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/reality-break-escapes-the-lucky-duck-speakeasy,0,Had a fantastic time at Reality Break for our daughter's birthday party. Did the Lucky Duck Speakeasy and Cypherspace rooms. Both super fun and challenging (but not too challenging). Staff was friendly and engaging. Got to know all the participants in our group and made it fun for each of them. Would highly recommend.

Definitely a 5 star place. My friends and I did the lucky duck speakeasy. It was very fun! We unlocked a bunch of the locks but, it got harder as we went on. We got as many hints as we wanted. They were very generous and they came into the room and helped us out. At the beginning in the waiting area, they're were little toys that could get you prepared. Right before we got inside the room, they showed us two videos, one about the escape room and one about reality break escapes. During that time, she showed us how a few locks worked. All the workers were very generous and nice. They said many escape rooms have scary escape rooms but, they don't have any. This is a great place for families. I love Reality Break Escapes!"

Gotta day we were pretty stumped right out the gate but once we cracked the ice all started to fall into place.  The room was challenging but not impossible.  The puzzles were clever and well designed.If you're in the Bellevue area give them a shot!"
