Had a great time! One lock was difficult to operate in Do Not Disturb. Location easy to get to. Problem free parking in the back. I LOVE that I can reserve a room just for my group! I won't do an escape room with strangers, it's just not for me. I like that the game was more than just opening locks. I can't wait to try the others!"
