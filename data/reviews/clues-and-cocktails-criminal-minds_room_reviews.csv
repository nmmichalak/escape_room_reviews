"Escape room ""“Criminal” Minds"" by Clues and Cocktails in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/clues-and-cocktails-criminal-minds,0,Attended the Criminal Minds murder mystery and it was a blast! Every single staff member/performer was professional and polite. We did the Gold package and the food was great and cast members stayed in character the entire time. They puzzles they have to solve the mystery were entertaining! Definitely something to do again when they when they change the show!! Absolutely a blast to do for a date night or girls night out.

"Escape room ""“Criminal” Minds"" by Clues and Cocktails in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/clues-and-cocktails-criminal-minds,2,"I had the opportunity to visit Clues and Cocktail (Criminal Minds) during its grand opening and it was so worth it! It's a new type of escape room that's set in a 1940s jail. I won't give too much away because it's an ""experience"" you have to see for yourself. The monologues and songs performed were great and I was even surprised that the actors stayed in character the whole time. This location turns into an actual bar at a certain hour where patrons can come and be merry without doing an escape room."
