"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-shanghaied,0,The professionalism at this space was wonderful. Everything from our friendly GM (Go Luke!) to the props and puzzles. It was all great. We completed the Shanghaied room in time with a couple clues from Luke. He did a great job giving clues that made us think in a different direction without giving anything away!
