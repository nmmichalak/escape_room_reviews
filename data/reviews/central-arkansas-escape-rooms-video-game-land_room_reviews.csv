"Escape room ""Video Game Land"" by Central Arkansas Escape Rooms in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/central-arkansas-escape-rooms-video-game-land,1,"My group, which included a seven-year-old, just completed Video Game Land and had an absolute blast! This room was well-designed, with lots of fun surprises and challenges. The theme and story flowed well and they didnâ€™t try to over-complicate things. Richard, our game moderator did a wonderful job and was helpful and funny. This room is one of the only in town I would say is truly appropriate for all ages. I will highly recommend this place to everyone!"
