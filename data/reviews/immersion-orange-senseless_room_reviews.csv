The puzzles were creative but not too crazy (we used two hints total). Would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenge!

"Escape room ""Senseless"" by Immersion in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/immersion-orange-senseless,2,Came here with a group of 7 friends and we did the Senseless escape room. It was my first time trying out and an escape room and I had a lot of fun! There was enough room for all of us to go around and find clues without bumping into each other. I'd definitely come back to try out the other rooms they offer!
