"Escape room ""Studebaker Scandal"" by Outsmart Escape Rooms in South Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/south-bend/quests/michiana-escapes-studebaker-scandal,0,The four of us came here for a Father's Day treat. We did the Studebaker Scandal. It was a lot of fun.I had done several escape rooms before. The guys had not done them before. This is probably not considered a beginner room. Definitely remember that these types of game require a mix of personalities and minds. When I am back in town I will visit them again for a different room.

Our multigenerational family completed the Studebaker Scandal. The puzzles were excellent and entertaining and there was something for everyone to enjoy!

We loved the atmosphere and the involvement of local history. The puzzles were challenging but fun, and we had help from our wonderful game master Dakota. Our group of 7 was aged 16-55 and everyone had fun. I would DEFINITELY recommend this!"
