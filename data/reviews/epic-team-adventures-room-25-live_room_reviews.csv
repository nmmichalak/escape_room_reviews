"Escape room ""Room 25 Live!"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-room-25-live,0,"Attended a fun evening and I have to say it was everything I expected it would have been. I've been to one other escape room, so my experience is pretty limited in this space. But from what I've experienced here, I'd say they have done a really fun and immersive job. They have multiple game room options. We tried the Room 25 escape room and it was really good. We had one hour to break out. I would say its an average difficulty escape room.Definitely give it a shot. Looks really good for a team morale event. Have fun!"

Also did a few of the other rooms with a group of four, and they are very polished, with some voice actors adding personality, and some good use of technology. The puzzles themselves are very good and have a nice variety. Definitely recommend Epic Team Adventures!"

However, the staff was fantastic. Fixed the problem and they went above and beyond for us to come back. We loved it and already tell everyone to do it. It was a blast. Best date night in a long time."
