"Escape room ""Carcel"" by Escape Room Delaware in Dover",https://worldofescapes.com/dover/quests/escape-room-delaware-carcel,0,Double date night with friends and it was such an awesome way to spend the evening! The prison kept us guessing but so much fun! We made it out with 15 minutes to spare. Definitely worth it! And the staff were great... very pleasant! We are def coming back!
"Escape room ""Carcel"" by Escape Room Delaware in Dover",https://worldofescapes.com/dover/quests/escape-room-delaware-carcel,1,"Went with a group of 11 last night to celebrate a retirement, figured she had finally escaped from working daily so sticking with that theme. It started with all of us being handcuffed together as a chain gang. We had to figure out how to escape a Mexican prison. We didn't escape in the 60 minutes but everyone laughed and had a great time. It was a fun activity at a reasonable price before heading to dinner with the group. Definitely recommend it!"
