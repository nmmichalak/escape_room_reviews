"Escape room ""The Inventor's Guild"" by The Ruse Escape Rooms in Grand Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-rapids/quests/the-ruse-escape-rooms-the-inventors-guild,1,What an amazing experience! We worked as a group of friends in the Inventors Guild room and had a blast!  Brit was AWESOME as a host and was very good at knowing when we needed a clue and when we didn't want one. We got down to the wire but were victorious! I can't wait to go back and do the Trophy Room!
