"Escape room ""The Office"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-the-office,2,"With 7 college kids, we escaped the Office with 11 minutes to spare! The debriefing before the escape was very helpful, as it made sure people knew how to operate the variety of locks in the room and what actions we could or couldn't do. The puzzles were very satisfying, and the debriefing at the end really brought to our attention how much thought went into these rooms!"
