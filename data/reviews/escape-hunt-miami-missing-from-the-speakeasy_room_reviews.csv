"Escape room ""Missing from the Speakeasy"" by Escape Hunt in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-hunt-miami-missing-from-the-speakeasy,0,"The headline dancer from an illegal speakeasy has vanished, and it’s up to you to find her!We really enjoyed this room. The quest to find a person lent itself to some creative twists and turns with an engaging story line. Unlike Blackbeard, this room was very linear and we always had a very clear sense of what we should do next and why we were doing. Great production design, clear and fun puzzles, and we’re of course always suckers for a good speakeasy.The one thing against the room is that it may be almost too easy for experienced escape room players. We blew through it in about 30 minutes, but they told us that most people don’t. Don’t discount it though if you’re an old hand at this. We still had fun, and we think it would be a great room for a group starting out on escape puzzles."

"Escape room ""Missing from the Speakeasy"" by Escape Hunt in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-hunt-miami-missing-from-the-speakeasy,2,We loved this place. A charming Victorian lounge like Sherlock Holmes apartment and the room itself - we did the Speakeasy - was very fun and challenging. We had a fantastic time with my family.

Went with a group of four experienced players. The room was well organized and designed. We escaped feeling like the puzzles make sense, but were challenging enough to be entertaining.When you walk inside, the decor is really nice. You feel like you are inside Sherlock Holmes sitting room. The staff is professional and welcoming. They offered us something to drink and took time to make conversation.I really enjoyed this escape room experience and would highly recommend it."

The speakeasy setting was amazing. This is a family owned and operated business. Incredibly nice people, they offer drinks before and after you enter the room and make you feel at home. If you haven’t already been here I suggest you try it out!"
