"Escape room ""Dr. Brown's Manor"" by EscapeIQ in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapeiq-dr-browns-manor,0,Went here with friends and played Dr. Brown's Manor. We were kind of intimidated by the low success rate. It was super challenging but very fun. I don't want to give too much away but the puzzles were well thought out and well designed. Highly recommend!

It was challenging!! We went as a group of 7 and was given an hour. I need to know the end - what happened to Dr Brown! I'm down to try again soon!!"
