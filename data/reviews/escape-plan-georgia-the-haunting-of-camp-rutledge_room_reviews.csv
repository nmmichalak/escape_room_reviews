We came back once we found out that the hunting at camp Rutledge was open. Group of 4 and our experience was unforgettable Eric and janelle were perfect hosts and game masters, so much so we came back the next night for bank heist. Perfect experience will definitely be back once hotel nightmares is up and running "

There was and we completed that one too!Now our friends are wanting to introduce others to this great sleuthing entertainment.Staff was great and very personable, we highly recommend this location and will return in the near future when new themes are added."
