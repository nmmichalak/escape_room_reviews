Everyone had such a great time, kids and adults. Great experience and would recommend it to anyone. We can't wait to come back in June for my son's birthday party and try ""The Search for the Jade Skull"" room!"

Did the Skull room last week, and today completed the Nautilus room. So well put together, and just difficult enough. Hopefully, they are planning on opening another location!"
