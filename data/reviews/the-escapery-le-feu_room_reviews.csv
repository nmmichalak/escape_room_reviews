"Escape room ""Le Feu"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-le-feu,0,We have been 2 times now to the Escapery and each time has been a delight. Full of challenging clues and twists. Would 100% recommend going if you havenâ€™t visited. Our group is planning another outing there very soon!!!!
"Escape room ""Le Feu"" by The Escapery in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escapery-le-feu,1,My family of five and a friend went for my husband's birthday and it was the first room for all of us but one. We had a great time and really enjoyed the interesting puzzles. We had a little help when we needed it and we were able to escape in time. I would definitely recommend the Escapery!
