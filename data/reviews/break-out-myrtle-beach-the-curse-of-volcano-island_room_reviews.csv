"Escape room ""The Curse of Volcano Island"" by Break Out Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/break-out-myrtle-beach-the-curse-of-volcano-island,0,"We had an amazing time as a family and we broke out! We did have a few clues given to us, we are not too proud. Our teenage children played a big part and were able to solve a lot of the puzzles. The new Volcano room is awesome, many surprises and sounds and moving parts! We highly recommend it!!"
"Escape room ""The Curse of Volcano Island"" by Break Out Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/break-out-myrtle-beach-the-curse-of-volcano-island,1,"I remember the first time I ever did an escape room (I was at a place outside of the Myrtle Beach area), I was not impressed.  I did not think it was something that I would pay to do again. Fast forward about a year or so and I get invited to a birthday celebration that led to Break Out in North Myrtle Beach. We had SO MUCH FUN!!! The staff went above and beyond when creating these rooms. Just did my third escape room at Break Out this weekend and each one has been so unique and full of surprises.  Great for coworkers, families, or just a group of friends. My favorite so far has been the volcano island one, followed by the serial killer room. Give this place a try, you won't regret it!!"

This place is easy to overlook from the outside, but don't make that mistake! While there is the possibility you will be grouped with strangers, we were lucky enough to have the room to ourselves.We did The Curse of Volcano Island and it was well done from start to finish. The walkie-talkie was an interesting dynamic for communication with the Game Master, but kind of felt appropriate on a deserted island. The rooms were very well decorated and fun to figure out. I liked the combination of riddles and physical puzzles in each room, and they flowed very cohesively, giving us our ultimate mission in a way that felt immersive to the atmosphere.Lots of love was put into this local room, and it was done with quality and attention to detail. As frequent visitors to North Myrtle, we will definitely be back to try other rooms!"
