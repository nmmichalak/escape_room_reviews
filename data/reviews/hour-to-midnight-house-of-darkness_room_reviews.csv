"Escape room ""House of Darkness"" by Hour to Midnight in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/hour-to-midnight-house-of-darkness,2,"My wife and I, who are self-proclaimed connoisseurs of escape rooms, did the House of Darkness room. It was genuinely one of our favorites that we've done. Amanda checked us in, and was extremely personable, professional and kind. A room has to be unique to get us excited, and this one definitely checked that box. 80% of your time in the room will be spent in complete darkness. No flashlight, no lantern, nothing. Literally feeling your way around the room. And it's awesome. And don't worry, no live actors and no real jump scares, just darkness. Highly recommended."
