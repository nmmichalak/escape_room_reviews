"Escape room ""Pharaoh"" by Big Escape Rooms in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/big-escape-rooms-pharaoh,1,"We were visiting from out of town and stopped by and did the Pharoah room before we flew home. The room was decorated well and the puzzles were fun. A few of the mechanics were broken so not as fun as it could have been - but flowed well. The ac must have been broken, it was very warm in the room. They did add a fan but it didn't really help."
