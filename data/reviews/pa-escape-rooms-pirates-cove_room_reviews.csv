"Escape room ""Pirate's Cove"" by PA Escape Rooms in Scranton",https://worldofescapes.com/scranton/quests/pa-escape-rooms-pirates-cove,1,A very nice escape room with well-crafted puzzles! Decor in Pirate's Cove is very well done and presents nicely when you first enter your adventure. Teresa did a great job helping us through our experience when we occasionally got stuck. A great family-friendly experience. We will be back!
