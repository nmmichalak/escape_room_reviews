Theme was executed extremely well, and puzzles were challenging but fair and thus rewarding to solve. This was my first escape room, so I'm probably spoiled now on doing anyone else's. But there are several others to try here, so it's really not a problem!"

My party and I did this room as a part of the Vault of the Volcano God series. The puzzles were fairly challenging but the overall escape room was great! Love the variety of puzzles and different ways of solving them. It was hot and muggy inside the room though and we encountered a glitch with the computer. Overall, I really enjoyed it!"
