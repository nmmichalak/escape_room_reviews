"Escape room ""Kidnapped!"" by Padlock Escape Games in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/padlock-escape-games-kidnapped,0,I went with a group of eight for a birthday celebration. It was intense at times. I did the math on paper and got the codes along with all the others help. Challenging at times but a group effect indeed. We needed two more codes to get out. But we all died. HAHAHA It was so much fun. Will do it again in a different theme. Thanks

It needs more than 2 people to be really successful.   Also, it's real math-y.  If you don't enjoy math or numbers, I would suggest one of the other rooms.  My least favorite room of the three at this location, but it might be other people's favorite."

Room. From start to finish, it was fantastic! We finished in 1 hour, 4 minutes (they were nice enough to let us see how long it would take after all), and each minute was filled with excitement. Certainly worth the time, money and effort to go. Will be back soon to try again for another room!"
