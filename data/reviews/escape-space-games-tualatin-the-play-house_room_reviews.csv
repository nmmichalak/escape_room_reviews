"Escape room ""The Play House"" by Escape Space Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escape-space-games-tualatin-the-play-house,0,This place is AMAZING!!!! I went with a group of friends and had so much fun! The Play House is by far my favorite! You play in the dark with flash lights but it's not scary which is great and had such a great time. So creative and not like anything around! I asked the owner Cory (who is incredibly nice) about having a birthday gathering there and he was more then accommodating and had some great ideas to make the event special for my cousin so we are really looking forward to that and can't wait for the family to experience the fun. Thank you everyone at Escape Space Games in Tualatin! :)
