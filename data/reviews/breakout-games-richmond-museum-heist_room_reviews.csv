"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Richmond in Richmond (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/richmond-v-a/quests/breakout-games-richmond-museum-heist,0,My husband and I did two rooms (Hostage & Museum Heist) we had a different game master each time and they both were really great. Both rooms were super fun but we loved the Museum Heist the most. Definitely fun if youâ€™re near by this is a great place to stop!

We all had a blast! First time for us all and we can't wait to go back and do another one! Monica was our host and she did a perfect job! She was there for us when needed and gave just enough of a hint to keep our minds going in the right direction. Well done breakout! Thanks again Monica!"

We had a great time, our Game Master Kim was outstanding and fun, and we came out of there chatting about all the awesome elements of the room for the next half hour. I would go back here in a heartbeat. Nice job! And thanks, Kim!"

We missed the mark by 30 seconds in solving the mystery in the Museum Heist! Looking forward to returning to solve other games."

This is our second time and our second place to escape as a group. Well thought out and a lot of fun. Made it out with a little time to spare."
