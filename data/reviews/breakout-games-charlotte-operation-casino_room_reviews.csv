"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Charlotte in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/breakout-games-charlotte-operation-casino,0,"Omg this was an amazing afternoon! We had a Groupon and went as a Family. We chose the Casino room and our guy was Phil. He explained everything and we were allowed to ask for hints from him. He gave just a little nudge to get us going. The clues were hard, sometimes a little too hard, which was awesome. We managed to escape with about 6 minutes to spare, and we are definitely going back!"

The place is located inside of the mall which I wasn't expecting, but it's easy to find. The staff was ready for us when we walked in and got all 30 or so of us situated in our rooms.The casino game was fun and very challenging and you feel like some sort of detective going through the clues. We ran out of time on the very last step so we were super close but didn't quite make it. I'd go again."
