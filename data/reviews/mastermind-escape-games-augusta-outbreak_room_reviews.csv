"Escape room ""Outbreak: Find the Cure"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Augusta",https://worldofescapes.com/augusta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-augusta-outbreak,0,"We did the CDC Outbreak and had an absolute blast! I am dying to get back and do a different room. The staff was super pleasant. My only piece of advice that I would like to have known up front is there is no starting place. You just start compiling clues and go for it. We spent 5 mins trying to figure out the ""first"" clue but it isn't in number format. So happy we have something new like this to the area and will definitely be back soon!"

Unfortunately, we were infected via the outbreak, but we loved that our lab assistant walked us through it after and showed us what we were missing! Iâ€™m sure my family will do the other three rooms soon."

We all contributed and got out of Outbreak. So much fun and we will be back.
