"Escape room ""Find Teddy"" by Escape The Post in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-the-post-find-teddy,1,"We had a moms night out here and went into the Find Teddy room. We did find him and beat it with 10 mins left! Very fun and challenging. We then stuck around for round two in the jail cell. This one was a little tricky but we had a lot of fun! Can't wait to come back, staff and owner are amazing!"
