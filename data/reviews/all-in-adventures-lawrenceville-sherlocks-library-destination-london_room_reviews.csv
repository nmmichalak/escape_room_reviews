"Escape room ""Sherlock's Library - Destination London"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-sherlocks-library-destination-london,0,"We didn't have an appointment but they were able to accommodate our walk-in on a Monday afternoon. They have both mystery and escspe rooms. We did the Sherlock mystery room. It was 45m and a ""level 3."" We just barely finished in time. We used a clue too... If you're going to do this one... don't overthink!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock's Library - Destination London"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-sherlocks-library-destination-london,1,"Just did the Sherlock room at Mystery Rooms. It was a really fun and unique experience. I have never done anything quite like this. You choose a room (each one has a theme) and you have 45 minutes to solve the puzzle inside. There are various clues hidden through out the room and you and your other detectives work together to solve the case. As a mystery nerd, I absolutely loved this, but I think your average Joe would too! The owner was incredibly nice & attentive. If you find yourself at Discover Mills, definitely stop by. It's an affordable, fun, and unique way to pas some time with your friends. The only complaint I have is that the room was really hot. It could have been the fact that you are in a small room with a few other people with the door closed, but other than that, this place was great!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock's Library - Destination London"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-sherlocks-library-destination-london,2,You gave to try this!  A perfect and fun thing to do when you want something more original than a movie.  We loved the sherlock room and the royals room.  Clues can be tricky...on your first room you might want a clue if you are stuck.   But put on your thinking caps and give it a try.    Good luck!
