"Escape room ""Dognapped"" by Extraordinary Escape Rooms in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/extraordinary-escape-rooms-dognapped,1,Awesome escape room we had a BLAST!!! We called to see if she could squeeze us in on the same night which she did. We did the Dognapped room. It fits up to 4 people but we were 2 people and we made it out with 6 min left. The room holds many clues and you must find everything in order to move on. Not everything is a clue though. The pressure is on from the beginning so don't waste any time. We were able to ask for clues when we got stuck but she did not deduct time from the clock. Niki who was in charge was a very sweet woman and helped make the experience so much more enjoyable. Thank you for a great night we can't wait to come back with more friends

I did the pet detective room which was awesome! I'm definitely sold on trying the two other rooms!"
