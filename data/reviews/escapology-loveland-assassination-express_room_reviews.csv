"Escape room ""Assassination Express"" by Escapology Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/escapology-loveland-assassination-express,0,"My department at work used this as a team building exercise and it was perfect for that. I was skeptical if I would like it at first but everything is really interactive and if you're in to solving things using clues then it's perfect for you. My team did the Assassination game and although it was a beginner level, it was pretty tough. I'd like to go back and do the virus one. After everything is done, you take a picture and they send it to your email for free. All of the staff was very nice as well. I will definitely visit again."
