"Escape room ""Red Scare"" by Clue'd In Escape Rooms in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/clued-in-escape-rooms-red-scare,0,"A group of 8 had a great time finding and solving some difficult clues and were challenged immensely. The only downside was that one of the props used to find clues was faulty and didn't afford us the opportunity to actually ""escape"". We had ample time to decipher the clues, but were unable to do so due to the prop malfunction. An employee even said that they hate that part of the room, because it doesn't always work well.  If that component gets fixed, I would strongly recommend this experience to others."
