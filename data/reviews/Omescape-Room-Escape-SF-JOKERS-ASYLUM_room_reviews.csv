"Escape room ""Joker's Asylum"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-JOKERS-ASYLUM,0,"Went to omescape with my family just for fun. It was our first time ever doing an escape room, and my brother chose 'Jokers Asylum' which is the hardest one to do. We didn't know what to expect. But even though we didn't have any experience, it was so fun. The puzzles were very challenging and fun at the same time. The waiting area was fun filled with games and a couple of practice problem things to get you ready for the rooms. The staff was very nice and helpful. Hoping to come back real soon!"

It was definitely difficult - needed a nap after! Would make a unique experience for corporate events or birthday parties. The staff was very nice - they didn't rush us at all when we went overtime and they gave us hints when they saw we were struggling a bit.If you're up for the challenge and you've got a good team, it makes for a fun and new activity!"
