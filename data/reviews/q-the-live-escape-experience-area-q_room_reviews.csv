"Escape room ""Area Q"" by Q: The Live Escape Experience in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/q-the-live-escape-experience-area-q,0,"Q's rooms have been our favorites since we started playing escape rooms. We missed the Pharaoh room, but Area Q, Salem, the Asylum, and (most recently) the Seance room are all incredible. One of the more unique aspects of Q is the way they integrate interactions with the moderator into the experience. Their themes are also quite clever and unique."

Loved it! Especially liked the live guard, added to the experience tremendously. Will be back to the other rooms in time!"

Easily one of the best birthdays I've ever had. The plot, the actor and staff were amazing. The room decorations and clues were great and it was such an adrenaline rush! We got out just in the nick of time and all out of breath by the end. The whole experience felt so real! I felt like I really was an elite secret agent trying to save the world! Highly recommend Area Q! I can't wait to try the others!"
