"Escape room ""Area 405"" by The Escape Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/the-escape-omaha-area-405,1,I booked this with a Black Friday deal for my daughter's 13th birthday. They chose Area 405. They loved it! They didn't escape in time but they didn't care. The employees said they were pretty close to solving it and they got stuck where most people get stuck. She wants to do it again!

They gave us great customer service and it was super fun. Area 51-themed room was amazing, the clues were medium leveled but we had experienced friends and successfully broke out. Lots of fun!"
