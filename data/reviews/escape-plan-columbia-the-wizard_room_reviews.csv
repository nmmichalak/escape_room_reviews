"Escape room ""The Wizard"" by Escape Plan Columbia in Columbia",https://worldofescapes.com/columbia/quests/escape-plan-columbia-the-wizard,1,The Wizard was such a fun puzzle room. We were grouped with people we didn't know but they seemed to communicate very well with us. Things we thought were clues weren't and it's really intricate to be thrown off and not have everything laid out for you. I definitely recommend this place for sure!
