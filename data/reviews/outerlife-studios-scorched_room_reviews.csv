"Escape room ""Scorched"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-scorched,0,My second visit to Outerlife Studios. This time the six of us tried the new Scorched Escape room and the folks at Outerlife have done a great job again! The room was kind of creepy in a good way and every bit as challenging as their other room Disarm. If anyone in your party is very old or physically challenged I would recommend the Disarm room as it is easier physically. A great way to spend time with friends or family and you will learn how they handle problem solving.

Other escape rooms we had done before didn't even come close! I won't give away spoilers- but the entire atmosphere of this room was just top notch. You go through so many different areas, it is decorated perfectly, and they even have music/temperature/scents/extras to set the mood! I (unfortunately) typically find escape rooms to be too expensive, but with how much detail (both set up and during the game) went into this room, I feel it was appropriate. GO TO THIS ESCAPE ROOM! Challenging & oh man, we couldn't stop talking about how cool the experience was."

The theme, puzzles, and progression of the room is something you seriously cannot find anywhere else! Outerlife Studios steps up the bar 10 notches on escape rooms."

The set was massive and very, very immersive! Our GM was outstanding and we had a blast topping their leaderboard! This was my 160th something room and would highly recommend!"

I have done escape rooms before but nothing like this! State of the art, realistic and totally immersive! Game master Mike was extremely gracious and friendly! I cannot way to try Disarm SOON!"
