"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bunker-chicago,0,It was a great experience for the whole family. Not too scary but still challenging. Doug was a great guide because he supported our six year old while the sound effects were active.

"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bunker-chicago,2,I loved this place so much that I decided to make it official! I put a ring on it! (AKA I decided to become a Game Master!)

My guide was very nice and fun, and the Bunker was SO FUN. The room is pretty hard to complete and requires a variety of skill sets, but it definitely will be a memorable experience!"
"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bunker-chicago,6,"Great experience! We did ""The Bunker"" as a family, and it was pretty tricky but (with a few hints) we diffused the bomb with 45 seconds to spare. Marcus, the host, was super-friendly and when our 6-year-old son (who's done these before and usually loves them) got a little freaked out about ""the bomb,"" Marcus invited him to watch us finish from the control room and deliver clues, which was super-kind of him (and maybe against company policy, hope I don't get him in trouble!). I think our son actually kind of enjoyed that even more!There were a couple minor procedural glitches, (one clue was missing and a latch was stuck), in both cases the host noticed right away and helped us out.Can't wait to go back and try out their other rooms! Like others have said, it's not cheap, but it really is worth the price for an intense hour of fun.If you've never done an 'escape room' before, watch the television show ""Race to Escape"" to see how it works. That show's a little slicker than the rooms we've tried (TV budget!) but it gives you an idea what sorts of themes and clues and puzzles you'll find, and how important it is to think calmly and work as a team."
"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-bunker-chicago,7,"It was so much fun trying to stop the bomb even though we failed. My husband and I visited Fox in a box with another couple, and all of us were so pumped after the game. Everything worked smoothly and the clues were challenging but well organized. I really liked that this place caters to smaller groups(2-5 people). it was perfect for our group. Some other escape rooms require 12 people in a group or you have to work with strangers.It was my first time doing escaping room and I will definitely come to rob a bank."
