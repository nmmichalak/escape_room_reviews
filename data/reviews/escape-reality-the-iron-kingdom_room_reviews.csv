Our group was a mix of adults and kids and we did The Iron Kingdom. Everything was explained well by our host and everyone had a great time making it through to the end. Will definitely be back in the future.

Our gamemaster Zabs did very well in explaining what to expect and gave us a hint for our very first room.We opted for Iron Kingdom. We read the synopsis for it and it was very much like Game Of Thrones as far as the theme goes. Our group had so much fun solving clues. We did get caught up trying to solve one but eventually made it through. Will definitely come back and try another room, maybe an even harder one!"
"Escape room ""Iron Kingdom"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-the-iron-kingdom,4,I had the opportunity to try the Iron Kingdom room and the experience was awesome. Me and a buddy tried to conquer this on our own but came up a little short. The detail and challenges were very impressive and this is a must try escape room! We enjoyed it so much we took on the challenge of Alcatraz on the same day. This is a great way to ESCAPE REALITY.
