"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-the-kidnapping,0,"This was our first time playing an escape room game and it was so fun! I mean we were a little bummed that we didn't break out, but it was a good challenging game (we did the kidnapping one) and Joann was great! I loved her energy and fun spirit. She was extremely helpful with the clues, that we ended up asking for a lot towards the end lol because we were struggling! However her energy made it a positive experience. It's refreshing to be greeted and assisted by people who genuinely enjoy their job. We will definitely be back soon! Thanks Joann!"

For my first escape room I couldn't say I was really disappointed at all. The only real complaint was that the directions were just a little unclear when it came to the clues but it was hardly a problem at all. The staff were incredibly nice and made the experience even better. We barely got out in time in the last fifteen seconds which felt very rewarding."
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-the-kidnapping,2,Breakout Games in Minnetonka is probably the best thing you could ever do. Me and my three friends came here for one of our birthdays in May and did the Kidnapping room we enjoyed it very much. That was fun! The staff here is very nice and make the experience lots of fun. I recommend anyone to come here with either family or friends you will have a great time.

We did the Kidnapping and it was very well thought out. Chris was our host and he made it fun throughout the whole time we were there! We already want to come back and try the other rooms!
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/breakout-games-minneapolis-the-kidnapping,4,We had a great time doing the Kidnapping Room with our friends yesterday! I also suggest to play with just your friends - it's such a confined little space that you'll want to know each other. Our Game Master was great when we really struggled on one particular clue and had to get a couple hints. We will for sure be back!!!
