Our operator, Hannah, was awesome! She was very personable and made the experience so much fun. We escaped with less than 2 minutes on the clock. Thank you for a great time."

We've done a lot of escape rooms all over the US and this was one of the best we've ever done. The games were brilliant! The staff was awesome! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a family night out, date night or any kind of team building event. Loved it!!!"
