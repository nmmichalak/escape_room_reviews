"Escape room ""The Nuclear Event"" by Cold War Escape Room in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/cold-war-escape-room-the-nuclear-event,0,I got to do both the rooms that Cold War Escape Currently has. I would recommend both but I would tell everyone and their brother that the Nuclear Event is a fantastic room for people new to rooms and a great story. You will have fun here. The location feels safe as well which I can't say for every room in Daytona.
"Escape room ""The Nuclear Event"" by Cold War Escape Room in Daytona Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/daytona-beach/quests/cold-war-escape-room-the-nuclear-event,1,"My friend and I did the Nuclear Event today, and we were very impressed and entertained. The owner walked us through the briefing and we were off, solving puzzles to get the combinations to various props, each leading to the next step in the scenario. The clues are well done, and the plot flows from step to step in a logical and consistent manner.The rooms are very well constructed and staged and the props look and feel realistic and substantial. It is clear that a lot of work went into the design and execution of these escape rooms.I highly recommend Cold War Escape. Great fun, and we were completely engrossed in the puzzles. We completed the room with just minutes to spare "

We loved Nuclear Event! My mom had never done an escape room before and it was a great first experience for her. My fianc√© and I have done a few before this and Cold War Escape is definitely one of our new favorites. We can't wait to go back and try the interrogation room.
