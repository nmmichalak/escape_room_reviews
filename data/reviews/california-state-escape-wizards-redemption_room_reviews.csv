"Escape room ""Wizard’s Redemption"" by California State Escape in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/california-state-escape-wizards-redemption,0,"I have now done two rooms here. Trespassed and Wizard's Redemption. Both experiences were awesome.The puzzles are fun and the designs of the rooms are well done - very detailed and immersive.  The game play is linear and so easy to follow what needs to be done next.Trespassed definitely has the creepy vibe going. Even the way you got hints was unique and fun. The Wizard's Redemption was even better! It is there newest room. The design was great. I love rooms that have automatic unlocking mechanisms once you solve a puzzle. Makes it more fun and ""magical"".The game masters are super nice and very helpful. Will definitely be planning more visits to their other rooms!"

Our first room we tried is Wizard's Redemption. I love Harry Potter so it's right up my alley. It is so immersive, and we loved that the puzzles were not just for combination locks. They varied and you use lots of different tools. We will definitely be coming back!!"
