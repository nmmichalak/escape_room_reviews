"Escape room ""The Castle"" by Amazing Escape Room in Bridgewater",https://worldofescapes.com/bridgewater/quests/amazing-escape-room-green-brook-the-castle,0,This room is a MUST if you are a fan of horror or darker themes. Very immersive. I went in a group of 8 and we finished with less than ten minutes on the clock! Definitely a room that has challenging puzzles. Loved it!

The castle was so much fun and truly enthralling. Kevin was really helpful and made our experience even better! We will definitely be back soon!
