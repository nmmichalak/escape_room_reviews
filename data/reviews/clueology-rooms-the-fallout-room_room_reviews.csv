"Escape room ""The Fallout Room"" by Clueology Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/clueology-rooms-the-fallout-room,0,A few of us did the Fallout room with a couple of people we didnâ€™t know. We all needed up working really well together and finding all the clues. The amount of detail that goes into the room is amazing! We all had so much fun and will be returning again very soon!

I've done over 30 rooms, my aunt has done over 20, and my two cousins have a few under their belts as well. We were all impressed with the scenic - it was incredible, very detailed, and immersive. The puzzles made sense in the story world, there were several puzzles that were new to us, and the staff was so helpful and welcoming. We enjoyed it so much, we booked another game before we left."

My group of 12 worked very well together at solving the puzzles and accomplishing the goal within an hour, though it was not easy. Clueology takes great efforts in making quality rooms with unique twists you wouldn't expect. Definitely the best room I have done to date!!!"
