We got out successfully! Yay! This place is so much fun!

Definitely a challenging room that requires you to use more than just your eyes. The clues are very creative and especially exciting when you connect them together. Teamwork is key to escape in time, so I suggest a group of about 6 people. The current record to beat is 34 minutes. I'd definitely recommend this room to others and I'll be back to check out their other rooms. Great family and friend experience!"

Everyone enjoyed it and the staff was super nice!
