"Escape room ""Narco"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-narco,0,This is the second time my family and I have played here it has been a great experience both times.  The staff is extremely friendly and very attentive during your game play.  We played the Narco and Mansion Murder escapes and they were so much fun.  I definitely plan on returning to play more with my friends and family.  Everyone has loved the quality of the escape games and we all agreed this place is at the top of its game.
