"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,0,The Secret Mission and Lunar Mission are really great intricate puzzles. The story and way you get through the rooms is refreshingly different. They do a few things other escape rooms don't to make you feel completely immersed.

Stepping through the door, you really do get a feel as if you're in a 70s-80s apartment with puzzles cleverly lining throughout the room. The puzzles also blend together well, along with neat uses of several everyday items. Digging the vibe of this room."

So we signed up for a later experience where you have to discover the identity of a Russian Spy.  That experience was AWESOME! The rooms were decked out in 60s mid century modern and everything about the clues and room made you feel like you were really into the story.  Even the guy who set us up intro'd it well.  Will definitely be going back to do some of their other more challenging ones!"
