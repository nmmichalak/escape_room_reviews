"Escape room ""Wonderland Revisited!"" by PuzzlEscape Hudson in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/puzzlescape-hudson-wonderland-revisited,0,Went to this to celebrate my birthday and we all had a blast! The room was challenging but also entertaining and fun. They paid great attention to detail setting the room up. Will definitely go again!
"Escape room ""Wonderland Revisited!"" by PuzzlEscape Hudson in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/puzzlescape-hudson-wonderland-revisited,1,Took our 14 year old boy girl twins and 7 friends for their 14th birthday.  They were to unfocused to solve the puzzle but still had a ton of fun. The staff was accommodating and the place was clean and well ran. They also let the little brothers (age 11) do a simple puzzle (10 boxes to open) in the hallway. They course solved theirs. A great experience. Ps Joeys diner across the street is awesome.
"Escape room ""Wonderland Revisited!"" by PuzzlEscape Hudson in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/puzzlescape-hudson-wonderland-revisited,2,"My group found Puzzlescape's 'Return to Wonderland' a highly enjoyable escape room. While this was my first time visiting Puzzlescape you can tell they really care about creating a fun experience for their guests. The rooms were on theme and fun to explore, with pretty decent production value and surprises popping out at us as we went along.    None of the puzzles were too difficult, though we did require a hint from time to time. Puzzlescape uses an infinite hint system where they will help you along or, if you prefer, more or less leave you alone. Escape room veterans should have a relatively easy (but fun) time in this particular room, but a group of newbies would probably struggle to get started. There is an easy version of this room which I'm sure makes for a great room for beginners.    The three of us managed to compete the room on the more difficult setting with about 8 minutes to spare. While the room is large enough to hold more people, I would not recommend playing this room with more than 4 as it would become crowded and some team members would find themselves looking for something to do.    Parking in downtown Hudson on a Sunday was easy and there are plenty of good restaurants nearby as well. We will definitely be going back to try their other rooms!"
