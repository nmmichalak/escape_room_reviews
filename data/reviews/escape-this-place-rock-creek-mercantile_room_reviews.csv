"Escape room ""Rock Creek Mercantile"" by Escape This Place in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/escape-this-place-rock-creek-mercantile,0,First off the owners were very nice and knowledgeable about the rooms. We did both rooms they have and both rooms were very fun and different styles of gameplay. If you have never done a escape room or you have this is a great place to have an hour of fun. I would recommend this escape this place to all. Thanks again for working around are schedule guys.
