"Escape room ""X-FILE: The Alien Activist Infiltration"" by Escape at the Shore in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-at-the-shore-x-file,2,This was a first escape room for us and we had a blast! The X files had to be my favorite which we crushed with just 3 seconds left! Had so much fun and I am defiantly coming back. Great activity for families and people of all ages.
