"Escape room ""Secret Society"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-secret-society,0,"This was my first escape room and, needless to say, we did not escape. But we did have a blast.We selected the toughest of the escape rooms (Secret Society with only 21% success rate) and thoroughly enjoyed it. The puzzles were creative and required both teamwork and thought. I know a number of other escape rooms have a ""zombie"" theme or someone else physically in the room but I loved that the only people in the room was my group of 7 people.Would definitely recommend."

"Escape room ""Secret Society"" by Mastermind Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/mastermind-room-escape-secret-society,2,We are experienced escape room players and were looking for some challenging rooms. We played The Castle and Secret Society rooms and had a great time! The rooms were well thought out and flowed well. The staff members were super friendly and professional. We'll definitely be back.
