Ed was our host and he was awesome! Ask for hints if you need them... they won't tell you outright but give you enough to steer you the right way. We will be back to try the other rooms.

It's only one room but the set up and story were really well put together. We had an amazing time and were able to solve the puzzle. I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!

The puzzles were challenging but fun, and your excitement just grows each time you figure out a clue! Very well-done, we definitely want to return!!"
