Immersive storyline and really cool sets. We didn’t break any records but we had so, so, so much fun. Legend of the Silent Tide is a great room and we’ll most definitely be back."
"Escape room ""Legend of The Silent Tide"" by The Escape Company in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-room-entertainment-legend-of-the-silent-tide,1,"This escape room is fantastic. We did both their Outlawed room and their Silent Tide room and had a blast in both of them. While you had a variety of standard puzzles, there were a lot of interesting ways to find codes and reveal new information that was clever and fun. I would definitely go back again and look forward to completing some of their more challenging rooms."

We couldn't stop smiling and laughing the whole time. Turns out we work really well together. Such a damn good time. All of the employees were amazing! We will definitely be back next time we visit Orlando.

We were so close, but didn't make it out in time needed a few more minutes. Charlie was a fantastic host and the experience and story line was excellent. Highly recommend it and can't wait to try the other rooms they have."
