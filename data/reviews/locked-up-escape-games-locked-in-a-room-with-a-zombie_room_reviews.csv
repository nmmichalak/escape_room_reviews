"Escape room ""Locked in a Room with a Zombie"" by Locked Up Escape Games in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/locked-up-escape-games-locked-in-a-room-with-a-zombie,0,This was my first escape room experience. We did the Zombie room and it was fantastic. The added element of the Zombie made it very interesting. The room was a bit dark and it was difficult to read some of the stuff we found but there is a remedy for that too. This place thinks of everything. Even the walk to the restroom was an adventure. Thank you for a great experience.

Zombie room was hard but not impossible and having a live actor in the room trying to catch us really made it different. Nice staff too!

There's a zombie in the room... Don't get caught or you may not make it out alive! The zombie escape room was a thrilling experience that I would highly recommend for all age groups. From looking for clues to distracting the zombie, my family and I had an absolute blast. The set was phenomenal with elaborate clues that made you feel like you were in a horror movie. Go check this out, it will not disappoint!"

The Zombie was so real I never doubted for a minute that I was going to get bit.The puzzles were challenging and time sensitive since you are working around the Zombie whose chain gets longer the longer you take to solve them.Kudos to the great staff for helping guide us.
