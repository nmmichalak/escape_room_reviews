Great fun room with an awesome backstory! It was a fun room, but about 1-2 things were a little confusing as some of the clues that went together, you had to guess they went together, but overall a great experience! Excited to try the other two rooms soon!"

Though the theming may not be on par with Disneyland, the puzzles were challenging and rewarding to solve. Not the typical escape room puzzles. Peter was an excellent game master and explained the puzzles a little after!"
