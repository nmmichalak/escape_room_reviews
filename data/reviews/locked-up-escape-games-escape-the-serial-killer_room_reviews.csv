Definitely the best escape room I've been to and the props inside make it VERY legit. Both the serial killer and pharoahs tomb rooms were well worth it and loads of fun!

We picked Serial Killer. I was skeptical at first as I don’t care for scary anything, but this was great!! It was certainly challenging and fun. We didn’t make it out on time, but we sure did try hard and laugh a lot. Mikayla is awesome! Very personable and helpful. Definitely going back to try the Zombie room. Can’t wait!"

The girl running the rooms did a great job. Serial killer was a lot of fun. Disappointed we didnt get out earlier. Survived by only by 6 minutes.
