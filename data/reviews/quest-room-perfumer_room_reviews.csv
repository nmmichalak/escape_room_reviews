"Escape room ""Perfumer"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-perfumer,0,"Oh yeah, it's just incredible! The first quest I played here in LA. It's a damn interesting game, very high quality, with excellent sound and great scenery. If you never played quests - you need to visit here. But if you are an experienced player, you should look at how the cool guys are doing a real cool room!"
"Escape room ""Perfumer"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-perfumer,1,"This is only my second escape room experience BUT I can tell already that all other ones are going to pale in comparison now. I do think ""quest room"" is more apt because the focus is more on a real story solving a real problem and not simply just escaping. The attention to detail in the rooms and the storyline is so great. I tried the perfume room but I'd definitely go back to try the others in a heartbeat!"

It was my first escape room experience and it was beyond amazing! I didn't know what to expect and was a little anxious going in but once we entered, I was hooked. The story is so interesting and the escape room was so intricate and well designed. Loved it and I want t o go back to try out the others!"
