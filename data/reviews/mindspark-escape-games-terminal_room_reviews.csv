"Escape room ""Terminal"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-terminal,0,"Unfortunately I can't give this escape room a good review. I've participated in 40+ escape rooms in the Phoenix area and this room was by far my worst experience out of all of them. On the plus side, the room was very well decorated and the experience was immersive, however the train car motion actually caused some pretty moderate nausea with no way to turn it off until the first puzzle was solved. The remaining portion of the room had a set of adequate puzzles, but then 2 longer puzzles that were simply annoyingly tedious, it never felt like we achieved anything when solving the puzzles.We didn't escape the room, however in similar situations in other rooms we have enjoyed laughing about where we made mistakes and how we could do better and appreciating the design of the puzzles - this room only left us frustrated and annoyed.These complaints are probably causes or magnified by the fact that, from our perspective, our GM was either ignoring our group, and the clues we did receive seemed to be lacking or were significantly delayed from when we did ask for help.Considering the premium cost of these rooms, we will unfortunately not be returning to finish their other rooms unlike the dozen or other companies that we have ""cleared out"". I really had such high expectations and never have been so disappointed with an escape room."

I was nervous at first because we knew we'd be placed with a random group since there were only 2 of us. However, we actually had an amazing time and our group was great. We did the Terminal room which was very fun, interactive, and challenging. Both of us had a blast and would highly recommend. Hopefully we can go again soon and check out one of the other two challenges."

It was my first time, but my son has been to a few other places before and said this was by far the best! The Terminal room was well thought-out and addictive. The staff was helpful and seemed to really love their job! I am going back to do the zombie one for sure!"
