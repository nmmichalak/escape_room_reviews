We didn't realize they were private rooms (no grouping with strangers). That was an awesome surprise. This place was top notch. All the puzzles were challenging and Mark and Alyssa were fabulous hosts. The room itself felt authentic and all of the props were cool. We loved the tactical feel of everything, having to use your eyes, ears, nose, and brain! We agreed we are doing the Western Room next and dragging some friends along next time!"

My buddies and I were in for San Diego Comic Con and stopped to do the Voodoo Room. Not only did we play the Voodoo Room, we did the Western Room after that!The staff is great and fun to work with, the puzzles complex and insightful, and a blast all around! I'm definitely planning on returning, as well as recommending Lock Down to all my friends and family!"
