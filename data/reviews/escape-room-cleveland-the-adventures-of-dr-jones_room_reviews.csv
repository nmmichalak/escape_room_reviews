"Escape room ""The Adventures of Dr. Jones"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-the-adventures-of-dr-jones,0,"Did the “Dr. Jones” room with my family. The four of us managed to escape with about 17 minutes remaining. Overall we had a great time, however, it’s definitely apparent that the room is taken a fairly good beating from other groups. Duct tape on the book shelves, an automated drawer that was pretty beat up, so on.All that being said, everything worked, and there were several “wow” moments throughout. We had a great time and will do it again!"

Have done both Mad Scientist and the Chocolate Factory (Strongsville location) rooms before and, while I loved all of them, the Dr. Jones room was my favorite! In this room, my group was able to get started on solving clues right away, and didn't feel like it took us a bit to know what we were looking for. A great beginner room! We came very close to escaping but were just a couple clues short! We will definitely be back in the future!"

This was a great time! My husband and I stopped in for a little something different on date night. We tried the Indiana Jones themed room. We were very impressed by the room, I don't want to spoil anything so I will just say you are in for a surprise! Very tough and the two of us only finished 85% in the hour time. We should have worked together more on the first part and we could have probably gotten it done. We enjoyed and would try again! May be easier with four people, I wouldn't suggest more- not sure it would be do-able with so many people trying to find clues."
