"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,0,Did the prison break. Very nicely set up. Mechanics are incredibly creative. Coming back next week to try the others.
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,1,"Our group of 8 did the Prison Break escape room and succeeded in escaping in their hardest room. Some of us consider ourselves useless in escape rooms but we had a good time. While there were a lot of puzzles and hidden objects to solve, the game is as hard as you want to make it because a lot of clues are given even if you don't ask for them. If you want to make the game harder, probably tell the game keeper that you do not want clues given unless you ask. Overall would recommend if you are wanting to be challenged but not so much so that you feel like you have no chance of escaping. Paris was our game keeper and she was definitely keeping an eye out for us and letting us know what illegal things we were doing (like climbing...) and giving us relevant clues. Wish there was more of a celebration after the game like having signs to hold up for pictures."

We booked the Prison Break room that same day, and it was a completely new experience. We had so much unexpected fun and would recommend this to anyone just looking for a fun thing to do!"
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,3,It was most amazing experience!! We did the Prison Break escape room as a family. We were joined by another family. Right from the get go the immersive experience began with a very well done setup. Teamwork and communication is very important and we were lucky to have a great dynamic going.The puzzles were fairly challenging but the thrill of cracking the clues was exhilarating. The solutions didn't cease to surprise.The team at the Escape Games is phenomenal! Very personable and super nice. Would especially like to mention Emily and Jackie who helped out tonight.Highly recommend this place to families - my daughter (7.5 years old) is hooked!

We just finished the prison break room and it was so amazing and immersive.  What was so great was that Jeff and gurion were so accommodating to one of our teammates being late.  It was great having the full time and for them to allow us to wait and do the room together.  We are definitely coming back to do every room and finish them all.  Best kind of service and such intuitive rooms.
