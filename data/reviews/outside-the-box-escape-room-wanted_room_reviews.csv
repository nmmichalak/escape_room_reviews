"Escape room ""Wanted"" by Outside the Box Escape Room in Harrisburg",https://worldofescapes.com/hershey/quests/outside-the-box-escape-room-wanted,0,"We visited the Wanted Room for our anniversary, and got paired up with a nice trio of guys. We had a great time! The staff was friendly and easy to chat with. It was fun and challenging, but not frustrating. And we finished with 15 minutes to spare!! We will definitely be back again."

We had a blast! We did Wanted. It was so well done! A great mix of easy, hard, and tricky clues. We did manage to escape, with lots of cooperation and teamwork. The facility was clean. Sean was a great host. Everything ran smoothly and it was very organized. We will definitely do it again!"
