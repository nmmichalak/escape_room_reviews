"Escape room ""Mission Sigma VR"" by VR Tech Lounge in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/vr-tech-lounge-mission-sigma,2,"We (my twins are 9) have been to the VR Tech Lounge probably 12 times, and have gotten to know the owners, who are very kind, and seem genuinely excited to share their business and the VR experience with you.  Even though I'm 50, I have only been once and NOT joined them.  It's amazing."
