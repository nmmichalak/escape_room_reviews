"Escape room ""CSI: Search and Rescue"" by Lock'd Escape Adventures in Putnam",https://worldofescapes.com/putnam/quests/lockd-escape-adventures-csi-search-and-rescue,0,"We visited Lock'd Escape on Sunday afternoon for their CSI Room.. we were greeted by the great owners Mike and Tiny...Thank you for another great experience in an Escape room. Even though we did not make it out..this room had fun features and challenging puzzles, which is exactly what we look for in an escape room. We look forward to returning to another of your rooms in the future."
"Escape room ""CSI: Search and Rescue"" by Lock'd Escape Adventures in Putnam",https://worldofescapes.com/putnam/quests/lockd-escape-adventures-csi-search-and-rescue,1,"my daughter, my neighbors and I tried this out for the first time and we really enjoyed ourselves! The staff was very friendly and explained everything to us so we were ready when we went into our room. We did the CSI room and were informed that it was hard! That it was! We didn't make it.... next time!.... the only thing negative was that the room was very small. The scenario is set or 2-5 people but 4 of us plus the guide made us feel a bit claustrophobic. We are already talking about the next trip"
