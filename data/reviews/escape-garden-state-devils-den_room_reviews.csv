"Escape room ""Devilâ€™s Den"" by Escape Garden State in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-garden-state-devils-den,0,"We have been to Escape Garden State before. The twists and turns of this one was great - this one splits your group into two and you are working together so solve a lot of the clues. Difficult, yes. Fun, yes! We got out with about 3 minutes to spare! The staff there is always so friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back for their next new room."
