"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-mission-mars,0,This was great escape room. This was my first one and I loved it. I definitely would recommend it!
"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-mission-mars,1,"Definitely fun. Had to use several hints but I think that may be in part to the fact that three of the five of us were under 12. Did the space-themed escape. Some of the puzzles required color matching, so those with color blindness beware. Definitely want to do the heist or jailbreak next time."
"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-mission-mars,2,This place is awesome!  My wife and I did every one of their escape rooms!  Each one is unique with different puzzles and the design of each room is fantastic.  This is one of our favorite places to go.  We want them to keep coming out with new rooms because every one they create is really fun!  Our favorites were Mission to Mars and Gold Rush but they're all fun!

My son and I did the Mars mission and it was the most fun I've had in a while. We did this a while ago and we still talk about how awesome this place was! Because we had so much fun, we have done other escape rooms since, and after doing this one in Chicago, none can compare! Next time we are in Chicago, we will try another one of their rooms!"

We've been to other escape rooms and nothing compares to the quality and fun TEG provides! Worth every penny! We have completed The Heist, Prison Break and Mission to Mars. Highly recommend them all!"
"Escape room ""Mission: Mars"" by The Escape Game Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-escape-game-chicago-mission-mars,5,We had a wonderful time. We're only staying in Chicago for one night so very happy we got into a late game. This place is a must if staying in the area. Each employee was great and overall satisfying way to spend an hour. We were paired up with other couples so it definitely made for a nice time getting to know them.
