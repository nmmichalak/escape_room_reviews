"Escape room ""The Mystery Room"" by House of Clues in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/House-of-Clues-The-Mystery-Room,0,"Spent my birthday with family and friends in the mystery room. Very challenging, there were 8 of us and everyone worked hard to solve the clues. The room was a little small but ok for 8 people. We had one hour to solve all the clues and unlock all the cases that contained the keys to open the door. We finished in 34 minutes. Great fun!"

The entire staff greeted us with a warm welcome! We did the Mystery room and it was so fun! The first 30 minutes we literally thought we werenâ€™t even going to find one key! But once you find your first key - the confidence builds! With only 13 mins left on the clock, we had found all three keys and escaped!"
