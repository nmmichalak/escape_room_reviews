"Escape room ""The Serial Killer's Lair"" by Mystere Escape Rooms in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/Mystere-Escape-Rooms-The-Serial-Killers-Lair,0,"Definitely put a new twist on our typical old ""date night!"" My husband and I did the ""Serial Killer's Lair"" and had an absolute blast! The escape was superbly executed, the actors were astonishing and the puzzles were challenging, yet achievable. It was hands-down better than the other escape rooms we've tried. Definitely worth it. We cannot wait to go back to try the other new escape rooms about to open!!!"
"Escape room ""The Serial Killer's Lair"" by Mystere Escape Rooms in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/Mystere-Escape-Rooms-The-Serial-Killers-Lair,1,"My wife and I went to check out the beautiful Mystere Mansion on Canal Street in New Orleans which is now doing Escape Rooms. We signed up for the Serial Killer room not really knowing what to expect and had a blast!! We were in a group of 12 or so people and had an hour to figure out how to escape the uber creepy basement which housed the serial killer. It was challenging, and had puzzles which led to other puzzles...it wasn't too easy, and it wasn't too hard, even though we ended up NOT escaping, and would probably be eaten by zombies in real life. It was a lot of fun, original,and everyone there seemed to have a great time...Highly recommended!"

They do themed escape rooms which enhances the experience. My group chose to do the serial killer room and it was so intense! Although the level was rated difficult, we managed to escape. The setup is really amazing, we are excited to come back once the zombie room is set up! You definitely want to go with a big group if you try the serial killer room because it can be kinda creepy lol."
