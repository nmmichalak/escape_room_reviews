"Escape room ""Ramblin Rogue Saloon"" by Escape Ashland in Medford",https://worldofescapes.com/medford/quests/escape-ashland-ramblin-rogue-saloon,0,"Team of 7, some of who have played over 45 rooms across 5 states, had a grand ol' time in the Ramblin Rogue Saloon. It is now a new favorite for my adult daughter (over 35 rooms under her belt). Well-conceived decor and theme, engaging story and mystery, unique special props, clever puzzles, lots of fun to be had. This was the best escape room of the six we played in the area. Highly recommend to all. Be sure to tell the bartender any of your woes."
