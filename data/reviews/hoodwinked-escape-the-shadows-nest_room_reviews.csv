"Escape room ""The Shadow’s Nest"" by Hoodwinked Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hoodwinked-escape-the-shadows-nest,0,"Hoodwinked Escape made my birthday celebration a memorable one for my friends, family and me. WE HAD SO MUCH FUN!!! The establishment was clean and inviting, and was ready for us when my party of 14 arrived! My cake table was beautiful, the champagne was nicely chilled, as well as the individual water bottles. Loved, loved, loved The Shadow’s Nest escape room!! It was scary, yet fun and it definitely forced us to use our brainpower and come together as a team. The other half of my guests were in The Experiment Room, which was also superb! We are already making plans to return!"

I would recommend Hoodwinked to anyone looking for a fun escape room experience."
"Escape room ""The Shadow’s Nest"" by Hoodwinked Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/hoodwinked-escape-the-shadows-nest,2,We came in for Shadow's Nest. I personally enjoyed the introduction to this room. The group for this session was small enough so that everyone was involved and the clues were hard but fun. Staff was friendly and inviting which is why we'll probably be back to try another room.
