"Escape room ""It's a Holodeck Mr. Holmes"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-its-a-holodeck-mr-holmes,0,"We played the Sherlock Holmes Holodeck game. What is not to like? Sherlock with a twist of Star Trek can never be a bad thing. The puzzles were straightforward but difficult enough. We had a bit of problem at times, but Eric the clue master gave just the right amount of hints. The explanation at the end really made it seem like we were in a whodunnit. This is our second escape room, and in this one the plot was as important and satisfying as the puzzles which I appreciated.  Two of us solved the game in 54 minutes... with a little blind luck:) Do it. I recommend it highly."
"Escape room ""It's a Holodeck Mr. Holmes"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-its-a-holodeck-mr-holmes,1,We had a great time!  My 13 and 17-year olds and I had an equally good time as we joined three other adults to solve the holodeck/Sherlock Holmes room.  Our clue master CJ helped us out a couple of times with hints.  I think this is a great deal for the price and I will definitely plan to do more of their rooms.  A bonus was that this is located in a beautiful old home on the historic register and it was just a pleasure to be there.  They also had some puzzles in the lobby to keep us busy while we were waiting for our start time.
