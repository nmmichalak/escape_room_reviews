It took us the entire hour but we managed to escape. The puzzles were fun and challenging, the staff will give you a couple clues if you get stuck. Staff was super friendly and made the whole experience a great time for everyone. We plan to go back for the other rooms!"

This was only my second escape room experience and I had a blast! Met the owner/operator and he's a cool guy. The Shipwrecked room was well decorated with a great story/goal. A bit spendy, but well worth the cost for such a great time. After we got out, we wanted to do another room immediately! I'll be going back to Challenges, soon."
