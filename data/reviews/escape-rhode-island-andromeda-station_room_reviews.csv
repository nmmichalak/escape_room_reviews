"Escape room ""Andromeda Station"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-andromeda-station,0,"My two daughters and I paired up with two other wonderful people for our initial foray into the Escape Room experience here at Escape Rhode Island. The operator/leader (Mary) was wonderful and very helpful and provided just a couple of hints to keep us on the right track. We tackled the Andromeda Station and after a bit of a slow start to get oriented, managed to escape with just over 3 minutes to spare. The puzzles are challenging and everyone contributes. The rooms are set up very well and we are looking forward to trying another room soon."

It was wonderful! Different, unique experience and enforced teamwork. Strongly recommend. We did Andromeda, but there are 4 options and it's a great bonding experience with family, friends, or loved ones."

I thought in general the staff was friendlier, and the escape room themes sound more interesting.They also had fun props you could use for your group picture if you succeed at escaping (which we did!). We did the Andromeda Station room, which was really cool! We were able to add on a 7th person to our group (normally the limit is 6), and they just charged us for the 7th person when we arrived.We had such an awesome time, that we are already planning our next visit to try the Mausoleum, one of the other rooms. I can't wait!"
