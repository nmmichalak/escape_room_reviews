"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes' Study"" by The Great Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/the-great-escape-room-sherlock,1,Celebrated my daughter's 12th birthday party with a group of girls. Everyone was excited and did not know what to expect. It took a few minutes to get into a rhythm but then they got the hang of it and started finding clues and putting it all together. There were some frustrating moments but they got through it and the group was able to escape with 1 minute 29 secs remaining. Great fun!!!!

I highly recommend visiting them if you are looking for a fun and challenging experience. If you are tired of the same old Miami vibe and want to try something new, this is the place to go. Warning: This isn't for people who's highest daily mental challenge is deciding what selfie to post on social media. I suggest you go in a large group, the puzzles are difficult and the time limit is constraining for just a couple of people.Great Escape Room Miami we will definitely be back soon to conquer your game room. Keep being awesome!!!-Dayana"
