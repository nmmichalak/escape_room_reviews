"Escape room ""The Time Collector"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-the-time-collector,0,"We went with a group of four. Three out of the four of us have done multiple escape rooms and it was the first for our fourth member. It was so much fun! I am a sci fi nerd so I loved seeing all of the details used in the rooms. Becca is an awesome game master and her hints were incredibly helpful when we needed them. Even as you progressed you had to use clues and symbols from previous rooms, which is a really clever use of resources. And the best part is we escaped with about 8 minutes left This was an incredible experience and we will be back to play more rooms"
"Escape room ""The Time Collector"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-the-time-collector,1,This is our 2nd experience here and we had a great family date.  Fun for everyone ages 11-50+.
"Escape room ""The Time Collector"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-the-time-collector,2,"Had a great time. Went with a group of 4. Did The Time Collector room. The puzzles were well designed and a great difficulty level. The staff is very friendly and upbeat about having you there. Well worth the price for the fun factor. This was my first escape room and I am looking forward to many more in the DFW area. The only bad part was either an oversight with the initial instructions or I did not catch the information when given. My group spent way too much time in the ""first"" room. We looked at the clock and were taking our time not knowing that there are other rooms that were to be unlocked as well. This caused us to feel rushed at the end. So, be aware in this location, there are other rooms that get unlocked as you progress. Still a great time and will go back to complete the other offerings at this location."
"Escape room ""The Time Collector"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/ultimate-escape-game-dallas-the-time-collector,3,"Let me start by saying that I have done 30+ rooms, and this place is at the top of for me - for a number of reasons. We intended on doing 2 rooms during our friends outing... and ended up doing 3 - they are that good and that fun.First we did the Time Collector - and all of the geeky elements put into this game are a nerd's (my) dream. On top of the fact that the puzzles were very well put together and each room was incorporated in the puzzles more than once - and that's true of all of their games that we played. We beat this (their ""easiest"" room with 7:58 left). The second game we did was Fallout, which was their second hardest room, and it didn't disappoint. Very solid in terms of puzzles, types of puzzles and tech, and layout (very unique). We beat this one with 10:58 left. We were done with the bookings that we made ahead of time, then decided to see if we could do one more. We opted for Si's and Mic's (which we read as See's and Mike's, but it's Sy's and Mick's - like Seismic's - like and earthquake - and that turned out to be awesome as well. This one has some unique puzzles, layout, and tech. We beat this one was just over 12:00 to go. I cannot say enough great things about this place. From the quality of puzzles, to the friendliness of the staff, this place is perfect."
