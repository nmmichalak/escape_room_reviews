"Escape room ""Cell Block D - Dystopia"" by iEscape Rooms in Wilmington",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington/quests/iescape-rooms-cell-block-d,0,Great challenging experience!! We attempted escape room Cell Block D. I was the only one in my family that had been to an escape room and I can definitely say IEscape was by far better!! Although we did not make it to the end it was a cool experience for our family. Truly a mastermind at designing and placing the clues! I will definitely be back to go through Pharoahs Curse!
"Escape room ""Cell Block D - Dystopia"" by iEscape Rooms in Wilmington",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington/quests/iescape-rooms-cell-block-d,1,My family and I had an awesome time trying to escape Cell Block D. We really enjoyed our first time! I definitely will be returning to go through Pharoahs Curse. The owner was very helpful and without him I would still be in Cell Block A LOL!!! I would recommend iEscape Rooms to everyone!! Thanks for the wonderful time!

"Escape room ""Cell Block D - Dystopia"" by iEscape Rooms in Wilmington",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington/quests/iescape-rooms-cell-block-d,3,"This was our first experience with an Escape Room and it was fun! We chose Cell Block D (and failed) but had a great time and worked as a team. Brandon was a huge help and was able to talk the youngest thru his puzzles (and rants). We met the owner, who designed it and is just a nice guy who wants to challenge people. Highly recommend this experience....put your thinking caps on before you go!"
