It was awesome! We laughed, we worked together, and we escaped our room in time! We even spent a long time in the parking lot afterwards going over the intricate details. What I loved was the great job they do setting the TONE. You can FEEL the ambience which makes all the difference. It was fun to see how each one of my coworkers approached the problems differently. We had a blast and learned a little more about each other in a fun environment. Definitely recommend."

The staff was on point in character. The only thing was our room was perfect except for one clue that was ruined by the group in front of us. We had the code to get out but there was a flaw.not going to say what it was but the staff fixed it right away. Much respect and we will be coming back.
