Definitely beats sitting at home on a Friday night. I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys exercising their brain in a fun and entertaining way. Choose your team wisely, there's a lot to accomplish in an hour.We did Jail Break 2 and escaped with 57 seconds to spare. Everything you need is right there in front of you but cleverly hidden so as not to be too obvious. The staff was friendly and entertaining."
