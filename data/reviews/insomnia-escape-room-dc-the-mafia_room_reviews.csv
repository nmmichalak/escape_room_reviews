The puzzles and mechanics were unique and made the room more fun than other rooms we've been to. Can't wait to do the Alchemist room later.
"Escape room ""The Mafia"" by Insomnia Escape Room DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/insomnia-escape-room-dc-the-mafia,3,This was my second escape room. I really had a great time with my 3 coworkers. There was plenty of clues and some really cool props. We were in the speakeasy. The clues were not to hard but not too easy. Great for people who have never done an escape room before and challenging enough for someone who has done an escape room. I would definitely recommend this company. The staffer was very helpful and attentive. She asked if we needed help and even made some suggestions when our progress slowed.
