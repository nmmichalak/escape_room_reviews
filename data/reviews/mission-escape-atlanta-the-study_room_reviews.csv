"Escape room ""The Study"" by Mission: Escape Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mission-escape-atlanta-the-study,5,We had a great time with our wedding group and we ESCAPED!!!! We escaped the Study With 0.01 secs left! Our Detective was helpful and we were the first group he ever had to escape. We are taking down that 23% escape rate one room at a time. We are coming back to do the hotel next!

If you're looking for a mind-stimulating group activity, then this is the activity for you to try out. Price: $28Parking: Located in a little office strip behind Atlantic Station, so there really isn't much worry about parking on the weekend (not sure about weekdays though).This was my first time in an escape challenge and I enjoyed it a lot! The max. number of people for a time slot is 10. We had 6 people in our group (all new to the escape challenge concept), and another party of 4 bought the remaining 4 tickets (quite experienced with the escape challenge). I think 10 people is a bit much since the actual room is not that big, but I guess it makes sense from a business perspective. I suggest going in a group of around 6 people, although you cannot control whether other people buy the remaining tickets in your time slot. The staff are great and friendly and the guy who plays the detective is super into his role, which sets the mood for the challenge. They're working on ""The Hotel"" where individuals have to escape their individual rooms before they join their group; I look forward to coming back to try that then!"
"Escape room ""The Study"" by Mission: Escape Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mission-escape-atlanta-the-study,7,"So definitely one of the better escape games I've played, what I loved was the fact all the puzzles were relevant to the scenario - they even added a few that were totally new and funny. Most of the clues were really logical if not always intuitive (that's a good thing) - so a super prepared group could definitely have gone through the room without burning up a single clue/ hint (you are given 3). In all great experience - I did it with a totally new'b group and they had the time of their life.Suggestions - The PA system needs to be louder, and maybe not so many hints? (but that's just me)."
