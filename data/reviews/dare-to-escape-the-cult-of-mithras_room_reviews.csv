"Escape room ""The Cult of Mithras"" by Dare To Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dare-to-escape-the-cult-of-mithras,0,"Did the Cult of Mithras. There was a mishap where it kept us on the first puzzle but it wasn't too big of one since our group split up. Had an awesome time and compared to the other two escape rooms we had done already, this one was immersive in the story and had puzzles that confused us as a group. We escaped with 45 seconds to go! Definitely going back to try the other two rooms as well as future rooms!"

It has a wide variety of puzzles that I have never seen in any other escape game. The game really has a scenario and they motivate you with a nice video on the game scenario before the game. The design of the room, objects, puzzles are all in a harmony with the game scenario. Puzzles were both challenging and entertaining. I was surprised by all the details in the game and room design. We played as a group of 6 and all of us loved the game."

The x-child and the cult of Mithras were awesome! Puzzles were not easy, but not too hard. Definitely make you think outside the box. We broke the record for the cult of Mithras room! Can't wait for the new game and to come check it out!"
