"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-excalibur,0,"What a great experience!   Awesome people at Epic who are friendly, informative and totally understand customer service.   Visited today with two 14 year olds (boy and girl) and five adults.  Great to do as a group.  Andrew as our clue master was very patient and provided helpful hints.  A great event!"

Sadly I am only visiting in Denver, otherwise I would be trying all of their different escapes. The staff was also super friendly. Great time!"
"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-excalibur,2,"This was our third visit to Epic Escape Game, so our review is a little overdue. We have been to a few escape rooms in the Denver area, and this is our favorite. We like the ""private house"" setting, all three games that we have played so far, and the staff has always been friendly and helpful. On this most recent visit we played Excalibur and our game master was Eric. He was very knowledgeable and gave lots of great information on past, present and future escape rooms. One of those being that the current Dorm of the Dead game will be replaced soon with a type of sequel to it. As a result, we will be returning soon to play it before the sequel is introduced."
