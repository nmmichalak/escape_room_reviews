"Escape room ""Dark Carnival"" by Enigma Puzzle House in Bloomington (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/bloomington-in/quests/enigma-puzzle-house-dark-carnival,0,"Went here with a group of friends for my birthday, and it was so much fun! We did Dark Carnival and it was the perfect level of challenge for our six person group. The owner was super accommodating and kind, too! We're definitely going back for the new rooms when they open!"

I have done both Death by Chocolate and Dark Carnival. Both were an absolute blast! They have challenging, but manageable puzzles that are created by the owners. The workers have great personalities and play the part of the escape room. Canâ€™t wait for more rooms to open up!"
