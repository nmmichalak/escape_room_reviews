"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Birmingham in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Breakout-Birmingham-The-Musuem-Heist,2,Visited Breakout Birmingham tonight as a team building exercise with cohorts from a non-profit. We split into two groups and tackled two different rooms. My group was able to escape the Museum Heist room.The game master was very friendly and clearly explained how the game works. We were allowed three clues if you get stuck but we only used two. I was impressed with the design of the room and the variety of puzzles to solve.Our group had a blast and thrilled we were able break out. Definitely a must-do for friends or team building groups.

That's ""roomer"" speak for, it was totes rad. Definitely, one of the better rooms we've done and we've done a few. The staff was great and very welcoming. Our game master (Caitlin) was awesome. Quite impressed with this place. I plan on visiting Birmingham again simply to try more rooms. This gets the Patrick and Amber seal of approval."
