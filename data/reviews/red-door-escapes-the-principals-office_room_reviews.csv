"Escape room ""The Principal's Office"" by Red Door Escapes in Little Rock",https://worldofescapes.com/little-rock/quests/red-door-escapes-the-principals-office,0,This was our first escape room and it was SO much fun! The time and effort that the owners put into making the room themselves really shows with the unique clues and layout. We can't wait for the next room to open and will be back as soon as it does!!
