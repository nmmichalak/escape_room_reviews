"Escape room ""Secret Agent: Stealth Force"" by Escape! Spokane in Spokane",https://worldofescapes.com/spokane/quests/escape-spokane-secret-agent,0,"Escape rooms are a wonderful way to spend time with family and friends, and Secret Agent did not disappoint! It took some teamwork and thought, but we did get out. David's humor added to the fun. I've done two of their rooms and look forward to trying more on my next visit to Spokane!"
