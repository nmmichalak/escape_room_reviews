"Escape room ""Licastro’s Lair"" by Entrap Games in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/entrap-games-licastros-lair,0,"We had a really great time at this place. The puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. We were in a Dracula themed room for Halloween, and my only complaint was that the room was very dark, which made some of the puzzles difficult for my aging eyes. A small complaint, though, for a well-designed room."
"Escape room ""Licastro’s Lair"" by Entrap Games in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/entrap-games-licastros-lair,1,The Licastro's Lair was challenging for sure but also so fun! Can't wait to do another. We did not make it out but we were so so so close. Everyone there was amazing. Very well thought out. We will be back for sure!
