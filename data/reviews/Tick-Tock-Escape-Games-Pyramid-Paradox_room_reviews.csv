"Escape room ""Pyramid Paradox"" by Tick Tock Escape Room in Overland Park",https://worldofescapes.com/overland-park/quests/Tick-Tock-Escape-Games-Pyramid-Paradox,0,We came to Tick Tock as part of a friend's bachelor party. We did the Pyramid Paradox room and had a blast. The amount of effort the staff has put into the rooms is really impressive and well thought out!

Staff was very welcoming and fun. After a short orientation, we got started. Our group included a tween, 3 teens and 4 adults including a grandparent. The room was fun for all. There were multiple clues and puzzles in the Pyramid room, so smaller groups within our group could be working on separate puzzles at the same time. We would definitely book here again."

Both rooms were challenging, but we were able to complete them with seconds to spare.Joe is a lot of fun and very helpful when we needed hints.I love that they have two rooms of each theme so you can play head to head with another group.I recommend Tick Tock Escape Games to everyone. I wish they had more themes so I could go back and play more."
"Escape room ""Pyramid Paradox"" by Tick Tock Escape Room in Overland Park",https://worldofescapes.com/overland-park/quests/Tick-Tock-Escape-Games-Pyramid-Paradox,4,We had 5 people for Pyramid Paradox and it was a blast! For two team members it was their first experience and they are still talking about it the day after. The room was very interactive as well as challenging. USE THE THREE HINTS! We got out with a little over three minutes remaining. Fun experience and would highly recommend Tick Tock!
