"Escape room ""Houdini's Magic Cell - Destination Budapest"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-houdinis-magic-cell-destination-budapest,0,My son and myself decided to have dad/son day at the Mystery Room for Father's day. We chose the Houdini room since no one else had completed it. They made sure that we were aware that it was the hardest room. We did it with 3:47 to spare. It was a great time and bonding experience.
