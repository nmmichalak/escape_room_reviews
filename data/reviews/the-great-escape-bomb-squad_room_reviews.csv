"Escape room ""Bomb Squad"" by The Great Escape in Cameron",https://worldofescapes.com/cameron/quests/the-great-escape-bomb-squad,0,Great place! We did the Bomb Squad room and were really impressed with all the technology incorporated into the room. Loved the room and the staff was very friendly. We will definitely be going back to do the remaining two rooms.
