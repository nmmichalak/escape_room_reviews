"Escape room ""Jail Break"" by Escape Countdown in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-countdown-prison-break,0,"We did the jail break room. It was our first escape room ever. We had 5 in our group (wife, our two sons ages 21 and 23 and nephew aged 22). I loved watching everybody spread out and work the clues that they found. We will be back!"

Kim and Sarah were absolutley hilarious and totally patient with all our ADD ridden selves. Thank you guys for making our first escape room experience a memorable one! Can't wait to see your other rooms :)

We booked the prison cell escape. It was challenging, but not so tough the girls lost interest. Sarah was so helpful and welcoming. My daughter and her friends can't wait to go back. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for adventure, team building, and general fun. Thanks again!!"
