"Escape room ""Pharaoh’s Tomb"" by The Perfect Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-perfect-escape-pharaohs-tomb,0,"We were absolutely blown away by the theming in here. It really is totally immersive and you get into the Egyptian theme really well. But I admit - IT IS HARD!! Unless you're a very experienced escape room player, start with Wong's or Obanion's. Again, the puzzles are very challenging, and different from the ones you'll experience in their other rooms. So each room is a totally new challenge. My teammates liked this room the best just based on the theme. "

Most of us had done some escape rooms in the past and this definitely has been the best one so far. We had the Egyptian themed room and it was so immersive and thoughtful. The story and tricks were great, and the layout was fantastic. This room was a tough one, but we managed to get out with a few minutes to spare. Thank you, Taz, for being a fantastic game master. We all had a wonderful experience and will definitely plan to come back to try the other ones out."

The rooms are immersive and beautifully designed. Puzzles are unique and challenging without being too finicky. Would definitely be helpful to have a few more people to have extra hands and eyes as this one is not easy. Loved it!!
