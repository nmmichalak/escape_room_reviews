"Escape room ""Toys in the Attic"" by Epic Escape Game in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/epic-escape-game-toys-in-the-attic,3,This was our first time in an escape room and we had alot of fun. My wife got this for her dad's birthday and we all loved it! The guide recommended the toy room which had a higher success rate than the rest and it was a perfect choice. We had an hour to escape and we did use our two clues but figured out the majority of it. We did it with two minutes and 30 seconds to spare! Overall it was a great experience and now they use actual phones so no more miscommunication! Will be back to take on the rest of the rooms!

We were a group of 4, 2 adults, one teenager and a 9 yr old. We did the toys in the attic and it was a BLAST! I was worried we would fail, but we made it out with 25 seconds to spare! We are already planning our next trip and which room we will do next. I highly recommend this place!"
