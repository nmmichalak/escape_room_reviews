"Escape room ""Lost Treasure"" by Beach Escape Game in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/Beach-Escape-Game-Lost-Treasure,0,"My family was in town, and we did the Lost Treasure room. It was super fun, and challenging, but everyone was still able to participate and contribute (even the 9 and 15 year old)! We made it out with about 9 minutes to spare. Lots of attention to detail in the construction of the room, and so much fun. None of us had ever done anything like it before! Everyone had a great time! Would love to go back to try a different room and do it again!"

We actually made it out in time...it was a great family experience. I would recommend the Beach Escape Game to anyone visiting SPB! A must adventure...and the staff is awesome!

The challenges are just the right skill level and puts you in the moment. The place looks great, staff is super friendly and the value is much better than bigger franchised escape rooms in other cities!"

We did the pirate room, which was a lot of fun and look forward to going back to do the Honky Tonk Room. Highly recommend!"
