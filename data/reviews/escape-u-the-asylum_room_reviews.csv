"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Escape U in St. Augustine",https://worldofescapes.com/st-augustine/quests/escape-u-the-asylum,0,We came in tonight and played The Lighthouse and Asylum. We escaped both and had a great time! We have played several rooms before and these were both really intricate and unique. The Asylum is easily one of my favorite rooms now. We escaped with only 4 minutes left and were told we were only 1 of 4 groups to make it out. It's easy to see how because this one is not for the easily frustrated! We can't wait to come back and try the last room.
