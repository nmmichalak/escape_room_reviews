"Escape room ""Chamber of Horrors"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-chamber-of-horrors,0,"My friends and I came to play a game here on my birthday and ended up sticking around to play two more on the same day because we were so impressed with the rooms. We actually came back the NEXT day to play another room! At this point we have played almost every room they have and have found each one more interesting and exciting than the last. Chamber of Horrors would have to be my personal favorite. It was an exhilarating, immersive experience. If you’re looking for an escape room experience that will have you begging for the next one, this is the place to go! Can’t wait to come back and play more!"
"Escape room ""Chamber of Horrors"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-chamber-of-horrors,1,Did this with my boyfriend for our anniversary. It was actually scary. The challenges were hard but not too bad. Allen was the best! 
"Escape room ""Chamber of Horrors"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-chamber-of-horrors,2,"This escape room experience is very highly recommended! My team and I went through the Chamber of Horrors, and as my 94th escape room, I have to say this easily makes it into my top 5. The sets and atmosphere were superbly well done. The space is expansive, and part of the joy was being able to explore such a vast space full of scenic moments and really clever puzzles! As a fan of escape rooms and the horror genre, I have to say that there were even a few moments that unnerved me- a grand endorsement of how immersive the experience truly was. We joined up with a group of three other folks, and I’m sure there wasn’t a single moment when we felt unable to contribute in some meaningful way. The asymmetric nature of the game ensures that your team and their specific strengths can all be showcased without running into bottlenecks and people standing around waiting. Our game master, Alan, was a great help, making sure that some of the tricky technical aspects of the game were running and we were aware of any of the challenges we may not have picked up on intuitively.All in all- Gotham Escape Rooms is a welcome addition to the thriving escape room market in Philadelphia. I would 100% recommend this team building exercise for anyone who wants to lose themselves in a room that feels more like living through a movie. I cannot wait to experience their other rooms (with 6 in total, it’ll keep me busy for a while!)"
"Escape room ""Chamber of Horrors"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-chamber-of-horrors,3,Awesome experience! We did the Chamber of Horror and loved it! The rooms were so intricate/realistic and the puzzles were great. This was by far the best escape room we have ever been to. We had a great time and can’t wait to try out the other rooms!
