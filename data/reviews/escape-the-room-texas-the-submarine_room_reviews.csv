"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-the-room-texas-the-submarine,5,"I do not post this review lightly. My family and I decided to add this room to our list of experiences and we all wish that we hadn't. The game master did not keep up with us and often gave clues that we had already passed. Many of the puzzles were not reset correctly and the story was disjointed at best. In fact, there were key elements that made 0 sense at all. We left this experience wishing that we had saved our money..."

"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room Texas in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-the-room-texas-the-submarine,10,Did the Submarine and had a lot of fun. Escaped with only a few minutes to spare with 3 people. That room says for 8 people but I would not recommend doing it with more than 4-5. 4 would have been perfect for us but with 3 we still got out.
