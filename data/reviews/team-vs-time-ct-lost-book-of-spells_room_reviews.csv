"Escape room ""The Lost Book of Spells"" by Team vs Time in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/team-vs-time-ct-lost-book-of-spells,1,"We've done quite a few escape rooms, but Team vs Time Connecticut was by far the best we've played. Immersive and eerie, ""The Book of Spells"" brought us back to the 1600's where we found ourselves breaking into and sneaking around a witch's house to find her prized possession. The detail is amazing. We finished with 15 minutes to spare. We will definitely be back to conquer their three other rooms!!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Book of Spells"" by Team vs Time in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/team-vs-time-ct-lost-book-of-spells,2,I just did the Lost Book of Spells room with a group of 3 friends and we had a great time! The staff is really nice and the puzzles were challenging and creative but doable. I would definitely go back to try another room!

We played the Gangster and The Book of Spells games and were so impressed by the theatrical immersion and the game play. What a great time! They also have a new game mid-build."

Went with my friend to do the Lost Book of Spells, and there is an incredible amount of attention to detail with extras built in to make it really feel like you've broken into a 17th century witch's kitchen.  Some puzzles were easier than others, and luckily we both had ""eureka"" moments to move us forward. Yay teamwork! You have to look at everything, and if you don't use something in one room, you may need it in the next.  Or it may be a complete red herring, but you figure that out as you go along.  In the end, we did retrieve the book from the dastardly witch and triumphed in the end. :)"
