"Escape room ""Phase III: Human Trials"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/bomb-room,1,"We've done the other rooms at the Panic Room so we kind of knew what to expect, or so we thought. Human Trials blew us away with its unique puzzles, and surprises. Our Game Master Rachel was the best and her excitement for the room made it all the better. I love when Game Guides love their rooms! Awesome room, just sad we've played the others, I hope they get a new room soon!"

The room was fun and gave us many thought-provoking challenges. Our group had a lot of fun and learned to work well together. We managed to solve the room, but only with help from our operator Claudia. She did a great job, provided useful hints, and gave us a very thorough run through of the room afterwards."
