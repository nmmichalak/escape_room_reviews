We were able to rent out the whole room due to the fact we were traveling with a 15 month old. We took part in the CSI senario which exciting and invigorating! (not at all scary for younger kids). The staff was friendly, funny, personal, and very helpful when we (unfortunately) struggled and needed some clues. All 5 adults who played were new to escape rooms and we will certainly continue to play! The next time we visit Myrtle Beach, we will hit up Breakout again!!!"
