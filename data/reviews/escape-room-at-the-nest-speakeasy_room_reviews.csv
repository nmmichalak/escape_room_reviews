None of us had been to an escape room before. It was challenging enough to be interesting, but not so challenging that we didn’t have fun. Everyone contributed while we scoured the room, looking for clues. Tim and Lori were great hosts! We’re looking forward to trying the other two rooms! (And yes, we escaped!)"
