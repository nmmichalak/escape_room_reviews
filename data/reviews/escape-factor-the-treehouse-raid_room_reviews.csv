"Escape room ""The Treehouse Raid at Fort Knocks"" by Escape Factor Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-factor-the-treehouse-raid,0,"My 12 yo really wanted to do an escape room as a family celebration for his birthday. None of us had ever done an escape room before except for online games. We chose the Treehouse room--it was so much fun! The ""set"" was well thought out and fun to look at. The clues took some work but weren't impossible--the information you needed was all there once you found it. Our game master Sean was great--he knew just when to offer small nudges. The basic concepts and ""rules"" to the room were explained clearly before we went in so that we didn't waste time trying to unscrew electric outlets, for example, to look for clues. We all really enjoyed ourselves and have already started arguing about which room we want to do next."

We brought our 9 year old son and did the Treehouse Raid. Jake was awesome and gave us hints as we needed them. We were an inexperienced bunch, so we definitely needed some help!  Overall a really fun experience - highly recommend if you are looking for something fun and different! We would love to come back on our next visit to the area!"

It was my husband and my first escape room. We were with our daughter, son in law and granddaughters who have done this before. What a fun and interesting experience. We will certainly be doing this again soon."
