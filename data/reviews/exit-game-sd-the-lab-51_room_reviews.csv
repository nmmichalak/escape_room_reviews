"Escape room ""The Lab 51 - Version 2"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-lab-51,0,"Incredible production value. Difficulty spikes require some really sideways thinking, but each room is unique with unique puzzles and real attention to detail. We've done every room here and they were all worth it, absolutely recommend it."

Upon arriving we were treated by our game host Drew where he made us feel very welcome and was very easy to talk to. We did the Lab 51 room and it was a good mixture of difficulty with the challenges. The only thing I would say was a little frustrating was being tall lol. Without spoiling anything I would recommend my tall friends out there stretch before doing this room. We have done between 20-25 rooms and this was definitely in the top echelon. I look forward to doing the other rooms they have, and I am pretty sure they are going to rock as well. Great job Exitgame, you deliver a legit experience."

Then I came back to do the Lab 51 room and also had a blast doing it. You can count on me to be first in line whenever they open up a new room. Would recommend to intermediate or experienced players!"
