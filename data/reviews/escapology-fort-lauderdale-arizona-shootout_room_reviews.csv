"Escape room ""Arizona Shootout"" by Escapology Fort Lauderdale in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escapology-fort-lauderdale-arizona-shootout,0,My friend and I had a great time trying to escape Arizona Shootout. We were not successful but had a lot of fun. Our gamemaster Erica Segarra was helpful and tried to point us in the right direction but we got bogged down on the map. This was not an easy game but it makes you think and laugh at yourself.

Very challenging but fair. The staff was very patient and professional. The Wild West themed room was great. Highly recommend.
