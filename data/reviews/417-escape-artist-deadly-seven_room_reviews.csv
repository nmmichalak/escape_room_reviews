We did the Seven Deadly Sins and it took a decent amount of effort, more than I honestly expected, and we didn't even do all that great. Overall lots of thought and effort go into these and I was truly impressed with the experience."

I did the Seven Deadly Sins room and when they tell you what you miss it’s like “oh duh!” But I can’t wait to go back and do more rooms.
