"Escape room ""Game of Stones"" by Gotham Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/gotham-escape-room-game-of-stones,0,This was our first room at Gotham Escape Room. To say we loved it is to say nothing! It's pretty challenging and we wouldn't have escaped without all hints the staff provided. I also took my family to this room after that so I've played it twice :-)

The game of stones room is amazing the staff was awesome they greeted us at the door and gave us the rules and began to walk us into the room and then we were allowed to open our eyes and when we did it made us feel like we were in another realm.
