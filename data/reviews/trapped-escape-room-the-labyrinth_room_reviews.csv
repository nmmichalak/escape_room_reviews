"Escape room ""The Labyrinth"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-the-labyrinth,0,"A couple of friends and I tackled he Labyrinth, and of the dozen or so escape rooms I have done, it is one of the best. Engaging, interesting puzzles, not just a series of padlocks. Great storyline. Highly recommend. Just sorry I wasn't in town longer to do their other rooms at this location."
"Escape room ""The Labyrinth"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-the-labyrinth,1,"I love this place!! First time ever in an escape room I had such low expectations but Trapped blew me away. The theme was really cool and the puzzles were challenging but doable and definitely encouraged teamwork. We won labyrinth with 3 minutes on the clock so not easy, but entirely possible! George, who was working there when we arrived, was exceedingly friendly, welcoming us as we came in, introducing himself and telling us about the place while we waited for others in our group to arrive. He was really encouraging and cool and seemed to really want us to have fun. I'll probably be back for another room. 100% recommend."
"Escape room ""The Labyrinth"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-escape-room-the-labyrinth,2,"The Labyrinth. The most technically and visually pleasing escape room we've done (we've probably done a dozen)! This is not your typical padlocks-and-combinations room. The integration of the theme and the puzzles is wonderful. George was very accommodating as we weren't able to book online (my fault) and he set up a custom time for us on short notice. After we escaped he and Jeff (designer) and Ryan spent time with us reviewing the challenges, rooms and facility. To me that was a special part of the visit - we appreciated the details in the game and were glad to find out more."
