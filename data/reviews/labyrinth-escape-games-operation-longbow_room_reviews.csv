"Escape room ""Operation Longbow"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-operation-longbow,0,"This was my first time at an escape room.  I am almost 50 and went with my husband, my son and his wife.  We did Operation Longbow, and we managed to get out with 13 min to spare.  I didn't know what to expect but we had so much fun solving the puzzles to get out. The staff was super friendly and helpful. There are not many things that I have in common with my son and his wife as they are in their 20's and it is hard to find things to do that we would all enjoy.  Labyrinth was a perfect outing for us and I can't wait to go back and do it again, hard part is choosing which room to do next."
"Escape room ""Operation Longbow"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-operation-longbow,1,"This has been by far my favorite escape room in the treasure valley. The room was challenging, had special effects, codes, puzzles, a good back story and the hosts were amazing! Our group ranged from 12 years to 60ish; from people who have done escape room around the US and newbies. All of us (8 total) loved it!!! This room had space enough for everyone. Way to go on a great room, we will do the other room offered! If you want to have a great memorable time try this out. Another extra--you CAN take photos, if you have been to other escape rooms they do not let you take photos--here they do! Thank you for letting us document these memories!!!"
"Escape room ""Operation Longbow"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-operation-longbow,2,"Operation Longbow is a top 20% room and now my #1 favorite in the Treasure Valley...Set design (+ props): the very best currently in the Treasure Valley, and will be hard to top. Mechanics, Tech, & Special Effects: the best and most elaborate currently in the Treasure Valley.  Working tech is very important to the Labyrinth team, and I'm happy to report all tech worked perfectly.Clue Distribution: one of the best I have encountered, very clever and hopefully maintainable.  We didn't need to really use it, but it really fit the WWII theme well.Searching: kept minimal, which is ideal, especially for veterans (thank you).Puzzles: very logical and required little [if any] guessing.  Excellent progression feedback. They were the perfect level of difficulty for beginner/intermediate players, but possibly too simple for veteran players and enthusiasts.  That is a tough balance to strike for an ER, and I understand why they erred towards the easier side for this room.  I'd love to see some development to allow for a quick-to-implement option to increase the difficulty here (my team of 4 got out in under 28 minutes with no clues). Lighting: Dim, but not low enough to need a flashlight.Bottom line is that this group took their vast experience, discovered what they liked and didn't like, and used that knowledge to build a terrific room that offers an excellent experience.  I'd recommend this room as #1 for enthusiasts visiting the area, and would just caution local 1st timers to not expect the exact same level of excellence at most of the other local options.  We also did the 60 minute version of another one of their rooms called Revolution (they typically run this with a 30 min version of the room).  Set design was excellent, use of tech/mechanics were great, clue distribution was unique and fun and fit the period perfectly, puzzles were mostly fun and unique, but their final puzzle I feel could use some more thought as that could definitely be improved upon and still keep the period authenticity they are hoping for.If you're going to do a few rooms in the area, absolutely do Operation Longbow, but save it for last.I'll for sure be back to try their Excalibur room that they expect to open in a couple months."
