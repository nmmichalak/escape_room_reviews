"Escape room ""STAR WARS™: Secrets of the Empire VR"" by The Void Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-void-star-wars-secrets-of-the-empire,1,"If you're like me, you haven't really played any virtual reality (VR) games because it's expensive to buy a home system only to be obsolete next year, especially with technology going a million miles a minute. That said, I love how companies like The Void have popped up to bring the VR experience to you but 100x better than any regular-consumer home system could. The $30/person is well worth it and it's just a plain old fun thing to do."
