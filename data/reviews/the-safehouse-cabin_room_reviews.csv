"Escape room ""Cabin"" by The SafeHouse in Tulsa",https://worldofescapes.com/tulsa/quests/the-safehouse-cabin,1,"The family and I were looking for an escape room to try out, and the lady at the front desk suggested the ""Cabin"". She said it would be a fun one to do and easy for newbies that were in our group. She was right- we all had a blast and even the little 4 year old smarty pants had a great time. He helped us find the final clue to get the last door open. Very nice, clean establishment to have an evening out for a sense of adventure and fun for an hour. Thank you again everyone at Safe House!"
