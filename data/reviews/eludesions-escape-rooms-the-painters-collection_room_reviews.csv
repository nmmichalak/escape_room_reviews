"Escape room ""The Painter's Collection"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-the-painters-collection,0,"So, I did not escape this room :(. However, despite my failure I have to rate this 5/5 because it was phenomenal. This is the hardest room they have and by FAR the hardest room I've ever done. I truly felt that I lost this room fairly and squarely (and I don't say this often lol). Before starting this room, you have a choice of picking it in difficult mode and of course being with fellow avid players, they chose the HARDEST MODE. That was our first mistake. I probably wouldn't pick the hard mode unless you had at least 5 people all of whom have done 20-30+ rooms. This was a true v4 room with little to no keys/locks. Lots of puzzles to solve and definitely a lot of puzzles that I have NEVER SEEN and was WOW'd once clue master explained it to us. This room put lots of different skills to the test and made us quickly realize our weaknesses. I highly recommend this room!"
