Not a good room for beginners! Our game master, Aaron, was awesome! Clues were well given and very helpful. We will be back to do more rooms!"

"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Wichita in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/escapology-wichita-budapest-express,2,"We stopped through Witchita on a road trip and did the Budapest Express room. The decor of that room was great and there were a few interesting components. I'd say it was good enough, but not amongst the best of all we've done (~40). If you're new to escape rooms, I'd imagine you'd be perfectly satisfied with the experience, but if you're more of an enthusiast I'd recommend you pass. We also thought it was overpriced. Most rooms we've done in the US before are in the mid to upper $20's, and the advertised prices have always included tax, so $30 + tax in smaller town feels excessive."
