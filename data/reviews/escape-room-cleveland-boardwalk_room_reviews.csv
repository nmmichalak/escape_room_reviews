"Escape room ""Boardwalk"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-boardwalk,1,"One of the best escape rooms we've been to so far. The rooms are very interactive and a lot more elaborate then other escape rooms in this area.. Boardwalk wasnâ€™t supposed to open until tomorrow but Tiffany (game master) was kind enough after My sister asked (since it was her birthday) if there would be anyway possible we could play the Boardwalk instead of the Wizards Chamber! Needless to say Tiffany was awesome and allowed us to play the game and it was amazing! Highly recommending this place we, will definitely be back again!"
