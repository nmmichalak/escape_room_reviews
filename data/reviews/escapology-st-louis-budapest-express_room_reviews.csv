"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology St. Peters in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/escapology-st-louis-budapest-express,0,"Our family loves escape rooms and this one did not disappoint! We did the Budapest Express and with a few hints, escaped in 50 mins. The decor was very well done, the clues challenging, and the story line interesting! Our host was Zach who was very personable and helpful! We had a great experience! We canâ€™t wait till the next one!"

There was a great mix of interesting puzzles and the staff did a good job giving helpful clues. The only complaint I had is that there were a number of times where there was only one clue to work on, so at least one of us was just standing around. It would  have been even worse with more people."
