"Escape room ""Missing Musician"" by Entrap Games in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/entrap-games-missing-musician,0,We did the Missing Musician room for my husband's 60th birthday. Most of our large group hadn't done an escape room before so we were pretty lost when we first got into the room. It was pretty challenging but thanks to Brendan and his helpful hints he made this experience fun for us and we actually completed the mission. Thank you for making this a memorable birthday.

Left the room with three minutes to spare thanks to the clues that were given to us. Great unique experience, we will definitely be back."
