"Escape room ""The Dark Room"" by Escape Room 5280 in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-room-5280-raleigh-the-dark-room,0,Highly recommend Raleigh Room 5280. Our youth sports team went to work on team work. When the athletes came out they wanted to immediately do another room. They had so much fun working together.

"Escape room ""The Dark Room"" by Escape Room 5280 in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-room-5280-raleigh-the-dark-room,2,10/10! I defiantly recommend going! Price is within line with every other escape room.We did “The Dark Room” and LOVED it. It’s very intimidating when you first walk in. There’s a lot of “confusing” pictures and locks. But once you start piecing everything together it all makes sense. It was difficult but doable. It was just myself and my best friend so it may have been a little more difficult for us since it was just two of us but we had a BLAST! I will be back to try their other rooms for sure!!
