"Escape room ""Ex Machina"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-ex-machina,0,"I've played Ex Machina and their new game The Society. Both were fun! Game master Theo was friendly and explained rules and game story thoroughly. Game themselves had good design, non-standard puzzles and solid support throughout the game. Lobby has some board games so you won't get bored while waiting.Nice place! Will come back for more :)"
"Escape room ""Ex Machina"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-ex-machina,1,"This place is awesome! I played 2 of their 4 games, Ex Machina and their newest game the society. Both had super immersive set design, creative stories and cool techy puzzles. There aren't a lot of escape room options in the east bay, so I'm super glad this place opened!"
"Escape room ""Ex Machina"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-ex-machina,2,"Fantastic fun and more to come! We will return as soon as possible to do the other rooms.Room: Ex MachinaOverall: Wonderful, friendly, and open customer service, Intriguing premise and unique ""in world"" tech and appropriately ""authentic"" props for immersion. Not too linear but becomes more linear as you near the finale. Enjoyable, relatively non-complicated tech and puzzles. The puzzles are strong and logical but certainly not too easy. No tedious task ""puzzles"" that can waste time. Outcome: We didn't make it but came close by being in the home stretch of the last set of challengesTime: Visited during soft opening several weeks ago; owner was extremely open and honest with us about the additional challenges that this may entail but it did not take away from the wonderful experience in the least. Should only get even better and better.Team: 4 - 2 adults and 2 teens - we've done 6 escapes rooms previouslyDifficulty: This was a challenging room for us but not impossible; This would be very challenging to first timers."
