None of the five of us had ever done a breakout room before. The facilitator was patient and helpful. It was a great time! We'd definitely go again. We all decided that we needed TWO hours to escape LOL! Highly recommend this ice-breaker for team building or new employee engagement. What a great way to get to know your co-workers!"

We went to celebrate a birthday, and we had children and adults. It was everyoneâ€™s first time doing a breakout room. The staff members were very courteous, and Bailey, our breakout game master, was super kind, fun, and energetic. She was encouraging as we read our clues, found our keys, and got off the island before the lava consumed us. Highly recommend this for anyone! So much fun, and we will definitely be returning!"
