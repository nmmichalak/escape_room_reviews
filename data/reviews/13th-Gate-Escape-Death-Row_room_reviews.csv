"Escape room ""Death Row"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-Gate-Escape-Death-Row,0,"I’ve been going to the 13th gate loyally for about 6 years now. I will never go back and they will never get my money again. we paid general admission. they were letting the entire VIP line go without ever alternating the general admission. we got there before 6 and by 8:30 we weren’t even in the door yet so we left. when a customer complained and wanted to speak to a nanager, instead they called the security guard and threatened to escort her out. absolutely the worst customer service. i get letting them go because they paid more money, but letting the whole line go without alternating it, yeah screw that and screw the 13th gate as a company. Many of people were mad tonight and i’m sure they lost a lot of buseniss tonight. "

I drove an hour to play after playing the ones in my city. The environment was incredibly realistic. This room is different than the Collector and seemed to be a little easier for the group, though was still challenging. The puzzles were layout well and definitely required team work and an absolute minimum of 4 people. Would high recommend making the drive out there. Can't wait for the next two to open, I will definitely be taking a group out there. "

We were close to escaping the Death Row room. The puzzles were so complex and well done. It was lots of fun and definitely a team building experience for all involved. Also lots of help from the staff in operating the game correctly. I will be going back to try the Collector room!!

We had been to another escape room in another state, but this was by far the best . We weren't sure what it would be like to work with 4 strangers, but it turned out great! We had a couple of glitches, but they were quick to come and fix them. We will definitely be back!"
