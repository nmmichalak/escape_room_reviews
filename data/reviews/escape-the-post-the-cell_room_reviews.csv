"Escape room ""The Cell"" by Escape The Post in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-the-post-the-cell,0,Great experience. We did the Cell which seemed like a good start with 3 people. Ian was our gamemaster and we'd definitely recommend asking for him. Overall a lot of fun!

Stopped the talked with the owner who showed us around. We booked The Cell for Saturday night. We didn't escape but had good time. The staff was great. Look forward to trying another room next time around.

We chose The Cell as there were only two of us. We weren’t exactly sure what to expect and the young lady who helped us was awesome. We did have to use a few clues, but we escaped with 53 seconds to spare. This was a great experience and we can’t wait to do it again!"

We escaped with just over 2 min to spare. Super friendly staff! Neither one of us had ever done anything like this at all. Totally recommend for a date night or group!!
