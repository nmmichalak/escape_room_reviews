This is the same company that runs Room Escape DC (or Fairfax), and so we came with high expectations, having played most of the rooms at their Fairfax location.  We weren't disappointed!  First off, their new space is beautiful.  The room was excellently themed and decorated, and their puzzles were creative, fun and clear.  This company is great for newbies, but also challenging for people who have played admittedly way too many escape rooms.  We had a great time and can not wait for more of their rooms to open.  The support staff at Fairfax has always been awesome, and that carries over to Bonds.  It makes a difference to have people who love escape rooms at the helm and we were so excited to find our favorite game master Andrew as the new manager at Bonds.  He is awesome and does a great job to make sure the rooms are some of the strongest in the area.  Whether you are just starting out or looking for a new challenge, this place is definitely a great place to check out."

We played the Battle For Gaul-Zaan: Enchanted Castle, and the Sadlewood Saloon. Both rooms were a lot of fun. I enjoyed the Enchanted Castle the most. Each puzzle was challenging and entertaining at the same time. The Sadlewood Saloon has a full playable piano, so kudos to the production. I definitely will come back and bring people who are escape room veterans and new-comers here. These games are creative and boast your brain. This was the first time I have been to an escape room and now I'm totally into it! Our coordinator and guide, Andre, did a really great job. He was very engaging and friendly. Igor Bond, the founder of Bond's Escape Rooms, talked to us before and after we ""escaped."" It is great to meet the people who put these things together. Igor is friendly and engaging, he was willing to talk to us and he is very passionate."
