"Escape room ""Wizard’s Academy"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-wizards-academy,0,"Highly entertaining, fun time!! We brought a group of 13 year-old boys here for a birthday party (7 kids and 2 adults). The kids escaped but the Wizard's Academy wasn't designed just for kids. The puzzles were weren't overly easy nor were they too challenging to figure out with a little time, teamwork or a hint. The kids finished with only 40 seconds to spare and the adults weren't feeding them advice! We were right there with them playing along! Andrew was our Clue Master and helped make it a great experience! He was on call to move us along when needed it and was enthusiastic about making sure we would have a great time! We're looking forward to going back with a group of friends to see how we'd fare without the assistance of a pack of 13 year-old boys!!"

"Escape room ""Wizard’s Academy"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-wizards-academy,2,"Outstanding room, tied for my favorite of all time. I've done probably 25-30 escape rooms. This is absolutely top knotch. We did the Wizard Academy. The puzzles are unique, many of them part if the environment itself, and the decoration puts you immediately into the mindset of a wizard. Unlike other escape rooms the premise was relevant and informed the storyline of the game. It wasn't just opening random locks for no reason, it made sense. Eric was an epic cluemaster! Helpful hints at the right times. Made for a great game."
