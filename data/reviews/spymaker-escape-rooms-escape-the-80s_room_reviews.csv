"Escape room ""Escape the 80's"" by Spymaker Escape Rooms in Flint",https://worldofescapes.com/flint/quests/spymaker-escape-rooms-escape-the-80s,1,My family and I tried our hand at Escape the 80's for my birthday party. The puzzles were challenging with only a little 80's knowledge required. We did not escape the 80's within the allotted time but we all had a great experience.The owners whom we met afterwords have a great passion for what they do. I would definitely do another escape room.
