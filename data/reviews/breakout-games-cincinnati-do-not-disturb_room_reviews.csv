"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-do-not-disturb,1,"After a few escape rooms, the anticipation wears out just a little bit. I did the new ""Do Not Disturb"" room and was not too impressed. I expected more from a newer room. I have definitely done better. I also think the cost should be looked at more as they have gotten more expensive. Still a fun experience overall."
