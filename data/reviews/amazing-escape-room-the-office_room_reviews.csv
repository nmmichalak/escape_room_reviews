"Escape room ""The Office: Race To Erase"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-office,0,"I had the most fun time here today than I had in years. I have never done an escape room and I can't wait to come back again!!!! We chose the Race to Erase and it was challenging. WE all worked together and brought in our own unique talents. When we ran out  of time, and mentioned to the sweet young lady working there that our ""hint button"" didn't seem to respond in time, she added 10 minutes - as no one was waiting for the room, and  we finished the rest ( with a little help from her too!). I love love love this place. Everyone in the other rooms came out laughing and looked like they did equally.  The help, attitude, and also easy location added even more icing on the cake. thank you for a great time during the  Thanksgiving holiday. We had a multitude of choices of rooms AND times"
"Escape room ""The Office: Race To Erase"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-office,1,"The Office- Played this as a group of 3 and we loved it! We got through the first clues in no time and the GM even asked ""Have you guys done this before?"" (We hadn't). Got stuck on two of the puzzles but after asking for a hint we figured it out and noticed that the answer was right under our noses the entire time! This room was higher tech than than the others at Amazing Escape! Looking back at it, this room was one of the easiest (If wouldn't have gotten stuck on the ones we had to ask for hints on. PS read clues throughly!). When we got to the last puzzles we had 3 minutes left and we finally escaped with 0.5 seconds left!!! A very close call! "

"Escape room ""The Office: Race To Erase"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-the-office,3,"We tried our hand at the ""Office"" with a group of four. The gamemaster was helpful and funny. I can't be too specific about the details of the room, but it was definitely well thought out, complex, and continued to keep us captivated throughout our time limit. I took a star off for the overall appearance of the place; it's a bit run-down."

Got paired up with another group of 4 and successfully took on the room together with just seconds to spare.  Was a really fun experience and the clues were well designed. Would definitely recommend."
