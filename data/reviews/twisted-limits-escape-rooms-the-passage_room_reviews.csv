"Escape room ""The Passage"" by Twisted Limits Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/twisted-limits-escape-rooms-the-passage,0,I have done over 15 Escape Rooms and nothing is even close to the Twisted Limits ones. The 90 minute escape room called The Passage is definitely the best. Congrats to owners Keith and Joe on such an awesome sincere experience.

The owners make it a blast from the moment you walk in! The rooms are amazing, especially The Passage! Very challenging but not overly so. My family's favorite place!"
