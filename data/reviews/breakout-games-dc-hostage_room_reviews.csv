"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-hostage,0,"My daughter had a small birthday party with some of her friends here today in the Hostage room, coinciding with a special event they were having where they took the main lights out of the room and have them flashlights to make it even more of a challenge. They didnâ€™t make it out but she had a great time!"
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-hostage,1,This was excellent! It was by far the most challenging game room I've ever done (Hostage room for people reading) and it was so much fun. We would not have accomplished it without our awesome game master Gabriel! Many thanks for a great night!

We had the nicest Gamemaster.  One member of our party was running late, so we weren't able to start on time. Normally, that means they would take away playing time, but since nobody was after us, the Gamemaster allowed us to start late, and still gave us the full 60 minutes to breakout, which was great because we needed every single minute of it!We did the Hostage room. I loved figuring out all the clues.  It was also a unique experience as it was my first time being blindfolded and handcuffed, so be prepared for that if you are doing this room.  I also really loved the amount of technology that was used in this room.  All in all a good time!"

Very well done and I loved how interactive the rooms were. Our game master was great and I plan on visiting other locations!
