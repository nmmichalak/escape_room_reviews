It's a real-time, immersive type of game, that's exciting and fun for adults. Be aware, this business location is in an apartment. My girlfriends and I were a little concerned at first, due to this, but this is in fact a legitimate business, and worth more than the money you pay for it!"

It was my boyfriend and I & we didn't book a time, we didn't know it was a requirement. The staff still allowed us in although they were not open yet Great idea for a date.
