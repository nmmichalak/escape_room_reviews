"Escape room ""Gallery Heist"" by Lockbox Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/lockbox-escape-room-plantation-gallery-heist,2,My friends and I did Gallery Heist last night and it was super fun! I prefer rooms that aren't scary so this was very enjoyable. We were able to escape rather quickly and even got 2nd fastest time (for now)! The building / rooms / lobby were very clean and the owners were very nice! I definitely want to come back to do House of Pawns!
