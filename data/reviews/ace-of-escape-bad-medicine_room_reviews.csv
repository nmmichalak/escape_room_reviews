"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,0,This was my first experience with an escape room. We attempted the Bad Medicine room. We only got about 60% through before the clock ran out. We had lots of fun trying to figure out all of the clues. This room is very challenging!

They have a wide variety of rooms, if you catch their Christmas room during the season, it's the best Christmas themed room out there. Very well thought out, not just another room with Christmas decorations. By far my favorite is Bad Medicine, super hard, but I love a challenge! They just opened a new two person room that I can't wait to check out - I've never done a room specifically made for two people. I have a feeling it's harder than it sounds. "

We had so much fun and got so close that we booked ""The Illusionist"" right after going back to back. We managed to escape that room! We had a blast! Definitely will be back"
