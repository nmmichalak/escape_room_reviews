There were 8 adults participating and we each felt that we were able to contribute in some way and also thankful to have each other to rely on. Will definitely return!"

The experience is pretty immersive; we had to wear blindfolds into the room and could take them off once an audio introduction finished playing. I felt genuinely surprised when I removed my blindfold and took a look around the room, so it definitely added to the immersion.We had 7 people in our group and we were able to escape the room with just a few clues along the way. I had a lot of fun doing this game and would recommend it for anyone looking for a teambuilding activity or just to have fun with friends or family!"

My friends and I did the Hostage room and were able to solve it, so that was fun. One of the moderators observes from another room and can see and hear what you're doing, so if you need help at any time they can give you a clue. We needed two clues along the way and it was nice to have that option.The props and clues were really well-designed and the whole experience was very immersive. It definitely took the skills of all my whole group to solve the puzzles, but it was a lot of fun working together to do so. I highly recommend doing an escape room at Breakout Games!"

It is a tight space, and maybe shouldn't be booked for over 5 or 6 people. There were some clues and locks that were not reset for our group, which was a bummer, but we still had a great time. I would recommend letting the staff know up front that you don't want a ton of clues, because they will give generous hints along the way unless you ask them to hold back."
