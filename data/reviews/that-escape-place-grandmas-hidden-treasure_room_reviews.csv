"Escape room ""Grandma's Hidden Treasure"" by That Escape Place in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/that-escape-place-grandmas-hidden-treasure,0,"We were looking for a room to do before we got back on our flight to Illinois. We took a chance and stopped by here and the hosts were most accommodating. They had an opening and we were in Grandma's treasure. This was the room that was going to break the 100 room mark for me. It did not disappoint. Even though it was just my son and I, we managed to get out with one clue used.The clues were challenging but not to the point for frustration. My tip to those who read this is pay close attention to detail in this room and communication with your teammates is key. The gadgetry in this room was very well done and we were glad we stopped here.Have a great time!"
