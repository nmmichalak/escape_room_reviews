We had a group of six and chose the John Monroe room. It was so much fun! We ALL had a blast trying to solve the mystery and came within one clue of escaping. We will definitely be back to try another room! Highly recommend this if your looking for a different experience!!

This room is a very basic model of an escape room, but has a lot of wonderfully pleasant puzzles. As one of my first escape rooms I have completed that started my passion for these rooms, I have to give them a lot of credit. This room is great for a group of six friends or so and offers a lot of good conversation. The lobby is beautifully decorated and allows for some creative photos. I encourage people to check out this company, however, if experienced escape artists, the room could use an upgrade."
