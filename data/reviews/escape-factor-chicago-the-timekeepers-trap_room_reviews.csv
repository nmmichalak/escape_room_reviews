"Escape room ""The Timekeeper's Trapped!"" by Escape Factor Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-factor-chicago-the-timekeepers-trap,0,My fianc√© and I have done several escape rooms on the past but decided to try this place when a big group of our friends were visiting town. It's THE BEST escape room we've ever done! The room was decorated unlike any room we've ever done - we really felt like we were in the Time Keeper's lab! And the challenge was very challenging even though our group got out with 15 minutes to spare! Can't wait to come back!

The craftsmanship on the props was impressive, and while some of the puzzles required thinking outside the box none were too frustrating or seemingly impossible to figure out - still very challenging, though! Time Keeper seemed a bit more complex than the Gameshow, but both were very satisfying."

We had such a great time. The owner was awesome and the puzzles were great. And there was enough to do in the room that all 9 of us were busy solving puzzles. Highly recommend this fun find. And bonus, they are moving soon and will have several more rooms!"

Got super excited when I found out Escape Brigade was opening up.I went with few of my friends (6 people, all in our 20's and 30's) without quite knowing what to expect. Not to give anything away - it was super fun and interesting. I'd say it was the right mix of cues, puzzles to solve, and a pressure of trying to complete the challenge before the time ran out. Not knowing what this Escape game is definitely adds to the thrill.Everyone on the team gets involved and contributes. Also, no matter how well you think you know your friends, you really get to see how they behave in a completely new and challenging situation, especially when you only have an hour to escape the room. Kind of cool to observe that, too.I was told the second room is in the making and I'd love to go there again soon."
