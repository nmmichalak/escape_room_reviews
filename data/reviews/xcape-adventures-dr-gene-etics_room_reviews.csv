"Escape room ""Dr. Gene Etics"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-dr-gene-etics,0,"Having now done over 50 escape rooms, I've got to say Xcape Adventures is still one of my faves. We've done Game Over and Steampunk (both now closed), and Captain Skully and Dr Gene Etics. Though Steampunk is still my fave, we really liked Dr Gene too.What I love about this place is there is ALWAYS a fun surprise. When you do a lot of escape rooms, you start to see the same mechanics over and over, but there's still always something unexpected in each of their rooms.Looking forward to finishing off the last 2 rooms, and hoping they have more room ideas in the works."
"Escape room ""Dr. Gene Etics"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-dr-gene-etics,1,"Went there with a team of 4 co-workers and did the Dr. Gene Etics room. At first, it didn't look like much, but it turned out to have more surprises then we expected! The clues won't be that obvious to kids under high school age. Adults (us) sometimes overthink the clues, but if you get into the groove it will all started to make sense. This was our first experience with an escape room and this one didn't disappoint! Will definitely go back and try one of the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Dr. Gene Etics"" by Xcape Adventures in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/xcape-adventures-dr-gene-etics,2,I've played two of their games: Dr. Gene Etics and Captain Skully and enjoyed both thoroughly. I've done over twenty escape rooms and a close friend of mine who I normally play with has done over 175 and he also enjoys their games! They are very interactive and pretty high on technology which is fun! The scenic is great and puzzles are different and innovative. The owners are very kind and I think they offer a very fair price compared to others! Check them out for sure!

I had never done anything like this! Still high on adrenaline! Very close to escaping Dr. Gene Etics escape room! Their staging is so fun and detail oriented. We couldn't believe when we saw that other rooms started to open up as you solved puzzles. I would recommend this to everyone! We will be back! no doubt about it!
