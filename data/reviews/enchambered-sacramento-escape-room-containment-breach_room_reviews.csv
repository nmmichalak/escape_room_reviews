Super awesome experience! Our team was able to Escape the Containment Breach with quite a few minutes to spare, but don't let this fool you into thinking that it was in any way easy! Puzzles were great and stayed on theme, ambiance was cool and well manufactured, and the people were fun and just as excited as we were when we completed it! Can't wait to go back!"

We had an absolute blast!!! This was the first escape room experience for all of us, and we had so much fun...... And we were able to successfully complete the Containment Room. Will be back!"
"Escape room ""Containment Breach"" by Enchambered: Sacramento Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/enchambered-sacramento-escape-room-containment-breach,2,Decided to book last minute with my boyfriend. The staff was friendly and the place was clean (and the mood lighting was the perfect touch). We escaped the Containment Breech room. It is honestly all about the puzzles but the storyline and theatrics/special effects were what put this location over the Top.

My friends and I had a blast. It was a great time, puzzle difficulties were perfextly balanced for our group, ambiance was great. Can't wait to come back and try Whispering Halls."

The physical puzzles were custom made and high quality. I did this room with 7 of my middle school gifted students, and one other teacher. We were able to escape, but don't be fooled - this room is challenging, but the right kind of challenging, and creepy, but not too scary. Highly recommend."
