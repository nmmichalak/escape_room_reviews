"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,0," This is a fun game! It is very immersive while still being puzzle heavy. We were paired with another couple that also happened to be escape room enthusiasts, so our team worked well together. The hint system keeps with the theme of the game and is very clever. There are puzzles in this game that I hadn't seen before. It's well done! "
"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,1,"The Testing Facility was a perfect example of a quality challenging room. I find that most rooms labeled as ""expert"" are only difficult because they simply don't make sense. This is not the case with this room. The room is non-linear with mini-puzzles are leading to one meta-puzzle, so it's a perfect set-up for larger groups. My husband and I attempted with just the two of us and made it to the last puzzle but we needed a few more minutes. Overall, it a great, logical and just plain fun room and we can't wait to come back and try their other room."

Entertaining theme and the puzzles were clever, logic-based, and needed all hands on deck in order to finish! The owners seem like they really love escape rooms and clearly put a lot of thought and care into creating the room. Awesome room and I recommend you book ASAP!"
"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,3,Great experience! It was my husbands birthday and they included clues about him. So cool! We did not escape in time. It's a difficult room. We've been to a few escape rooms before this and it's one of our favorites! Thanks for a fun time and for the cake! Can't wait for the next room.

Everything, including the hint system, ties into the story experience. The Testing Facility is a puzzle heavy room. There is minimal searching in this room. I really appreciated that we had to use our brains more than our eyes. Lots of unique puzzles in this room. Everything from number puzzles, riddles, and word puzzles. Very inventive use of props and not a whole lot of padlocks. Clever use of tech in this room."
