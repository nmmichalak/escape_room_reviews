My wife and I have done Woodshed and Jack the Ripper and escaped from both. We're excited for the new rooms so we'll be checking those out as well! Keep up the great work!"
"Escape room ""The Wood Shed"" by Mind Bender Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/mind-bender-escape-rooms-the-wood-shed,2,I was invited to experience this with coworkers for a team building experience and I absolutely loved it. We did the Wood Shed room and it was both thrilling and quite difficult. We ended up finishing with 4 mins to spare. We are already making plans to go back and do another room.
