The puzzles are clever, the ambience is epic and the overall care and attention they put into things really makes this company stand out! I strongly suggest the 7 Stones room."
"Escape room ""The Seventh Stone - Secrets of Abydos"" by Planet Deadline Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/planet-deadline-escape-rooms-the-7th-stone,2,Took our entire family of six with four kids ages 11-17. It was a birthday present for our 17-year-old. We did the 7 stones escape room and it was a blast! They set the room up with great challenges and great assistance that everyone was able to participate and make a difference. We completed it with 30 seconds left. Our host was fantastic and made sure everyone had a great time and felt like they contributed. Highly recommended!

The rooms are well thought out right down to the smallest detail. Our group of 5 came very close to solving the first room (Egyptian theme) so that motivated us to try the second room which has a serial killer theme. Josh was very accommodating and got us in right away. If you are looking for a fun, yet challenging activity for your group, check this place out! You won't be disappointed."
