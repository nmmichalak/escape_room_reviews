"Escape room ""The Will"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-will,5,"Two months ago I had stopped by enigma and tried the secret temple with a few friends from work and I had a blast going through the room and solving puzzles! Just came back again last weekend to try out their newest room, the Will, and it really showed me how lacking I am on my puzzle skills, lol.The will had so many things right! Not too many puzzles to manage, but that doesn't mean they won't make your brain hurt in a good way. They also incorporated some really flashy tech that made the next moment thrilling! Now all we have left is to tackle Apartment 205 and we are golden. Can't wait to come back for a third time"
"Escape room ""The Will"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-will,6,"I had some friends visiting from out of town who didn't want to do the usual tourist thing so we picked Enigma based on the high Yelp reviews. This was our first time trying escape rooms, and we were not disappointed. We went up the stairs of this old school building and were greeted by a friendly host. After some chatting he told us the back story to 'The Will,' their newest room. We went in having read the prologue, but not really knowing what to expect. We were brought into the room and locked inside this beautiful office. The puzzles inside were beautifully integrated  into the story of this rich tycoon and his last wishes.The tech in this room is just awesome!My friends and I really enjoyed the experience and I can't wait to come back to try Enigma's other rooms"
