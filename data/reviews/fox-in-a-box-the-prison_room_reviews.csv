It was our first time playing this kind of locked room game, and though my dad was very skeptical going in, everyone ended up having a great time. It also made for great dinner conversation afterwards :)"

"Escape room ""The Prison"" by Fox in a Box Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fox-in-a-box-the-prison,4,"Located in a cool, secured building, you feel a sense of anticipation. My daughters selected the bank robber activity to celebrate my birthday. We entered a bright and cheery reception room and were greeted by 2 friendly staff who made us feel comfortable. Crystal, our fab game master, explained the rules and gave us items needed in our quest. I instantly channeled my inner Catwoman. We entered the room and frantically tried to figure out clues that would lead us into the vault to access the gems in the allotted timeframe. My inner Catwoman took a hike when the lights went out and the background noises began. This was a great team builder and made us definitely think outside the box. The experience was creepy and hilarious and energizing. Although we failed to open the vault in time, a good time was had by all! We plan on doing this again! Game on, Crystal!!!"

We booked The Bunker to start with and had so much fun that we stayed and played The Bank and The Lab. Game masters Vincent and Krystal were a lot of fun and made the experience great. The facility looks great and the little extras they provide while they're setting up your experience add a nice touch to the whole vibe of the place.
