We loved the unique start to the game, and found the puzzles to be challenging but exciting. The staff is friendly, helpful and overall great people! We were here while on vacation, but will definitely return to escape the other rooms while on our next vacation!"

The puzzles were challenging; yet fun. We escaped from both rooms, but Prison break was by far our favorite one. Sam and Vince were great too!"
