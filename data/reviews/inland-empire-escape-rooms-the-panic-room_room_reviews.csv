My husband and I merged with a group of 8 others, even though we were perfect strangers we worked together and made it out in time! It was funny, suspenseful, entertaining and realistic. A great mental workout and good bonding time."

There were a lot of puzzles for us all to solve and we broke up in small groups to do this. The room itself was very nicely done and very aesthetically appealing. The gamekeeper gave us clear instructions and hyped us up with the incentive we needed to escape.The different types of puzzles and locks were brilliant. This was my first experience and I am addicted now!"
