"Escape room ""Moonshine Cabin"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-moonshine-cabin,2,I have been to several escape rooms in a few different locations and I like this one best. From the friendly staff to the selection of challenges this escape room is first class! I brought my family and a few friends. We did the Moonshine Cabin Escape room and it was great. I look forward to bringing my family and others to try the other escape rooms.
