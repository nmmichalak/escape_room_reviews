"Escape room ""The President's Bunker"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-presidents-bunker,0,I thought this was very well done. We were in the Presidentâ€™s Bunker. We made it out (and saved the world btw) but just barely! I would definitely go again to try the other rooms!

It's conveniently located downtown between Harp and Celt pub and Magnolia. Mather and Celine are across the street. We did the President's Bunker with was the hardest room, but we made it out in 51 minutes! It was very cool that doing one thing can open a box or a door or a wall, surprisingly very well done. I would come back again to do another room!"
