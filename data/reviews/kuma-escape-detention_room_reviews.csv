"Escape room ""Detention"" by Kuma Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/kuma-escape-detention,0,"Went here for my girlfriend's birthday with a total of 11 people in our party. It was all of our first time doing the escape room, and the birthday girl chose the Detention room. It was so realistic, and we all had so much fun. We all talked about it and decided to come back eventually to try the Utopia theme."
"Escape room ""Detention"" by Kuma Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/kuma-escape-detention,1," I came here with bf on my birthday not knowing what to expect.  I had so much fun! I agree it might've been even more fun if we had a full group of friends, but the experience was good even teaming up with strangers."
"Escape room ""Detention"" by Kuma Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/kuma-escape-detention,2,This place is SOOO much fun.  You'll really have your head scratching from playing this.  It takes a while to get use to the idea.The secret is to get over convention and be open to taking things apart and being nosy.  I think this place would be perfect for training detectives/officers who investigate a crime scene.  I imagine that you must use the same skills.
