"Escape room ""Y2K"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-y2k,0,"My friends and I went twice, the Y2K room and The Hatch. I personally loved Y2K. It was nostalgic, the flow of the room and clues made sense, etc. My 3 friends and I were able to get out with literally only one sec left on the clock. My group of friends also had great chemistry to figure Y2K out.The staff was great. They were helpful and friendly. I have never done an escape room before Waikiki Breakout so I have no other places to compare it too.My last note is how the location was great. There's a parking garage underneath King Village that I tend to favor parking at over other places in Waikiki. My deal breaker on a lot of places being awesome to hang out is more often than not based on the parking situation."

We're glad to say that the last visit was just a fluke. Tonight's experience was everything that we've come to expect and love about Breakout Waikiki, and to top it off, we successfully broke out! Y2K was a fun room filled with 90's nostalgia and some interesting, unexpected puzzles. Can't wait for more rooms to try."

We've tried the Manoa Marketplace, Ala Moana Stock Exchange, and Y2K rooms. For the thirty somethings, the Y2K room will be a trip down memory lane."

It was tons of fun, with some amazing surprises and well thought out puzzles. This took a lot of teamwork, attention to detail, and critical thinking. At some points we were speechless! The whole room was very nostalgic and entertaining. The staff was friendly and professional. We messed up on the final code, but we still feel like winners. My wife and I were giggly about the experience all evening. We had a blast!"
