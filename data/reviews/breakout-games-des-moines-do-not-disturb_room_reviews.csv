Breakout Games is by far the best!! This time we did Do Not Disturb. I won’t spoil anything, but the ending is outstanding!! We will be back again and again. Oh and if you can, make sure Stephen is your game master! He’s the best!"

Our first escape room experience and we did Do Not Disturb. Our guide Tyson was friendly, entertaining, and helpful. The setup was technical and cool, where a new door or cupboard would unlock with each puzzle solved and then another clue. We didn’t escape but we were close and that might be because my boyfriend wanted us to figure it all out without many clues. It was just the two of us. The kidnapping mystery and puzzles were fun and challenging and we can’t wait to go back!"
