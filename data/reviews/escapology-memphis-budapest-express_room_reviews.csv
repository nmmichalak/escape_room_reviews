"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Memphis in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/escapology-memphis-budapest-express,0,"Five friends and I went last night to do the Budapest Express. The lobby was nice, the staff was welcoming, and the room itself was very detailed. (Bonus: the bathrooms were spotless!) The puzzles themselves inside the room were a challenge. The scenario was really detailed and you got a great sense of the story from the items in the room. It was really a fantastic experience and we're already planning our next trip."

I'll be back again soon! We almost got out when we did Antidote and Budapest Express. Budapest Express was the most exciting!

We tackled the ""Budapest Express"" room. The rooms are very detailed and they really make you feel like you're part of the story. We forgot multiple times that our main objective was actually to escape the room and not to solve the mystery! It was incredibly fun and involved and I would recommend it to anyone. I'll definitely come back to try the other rooms!"
