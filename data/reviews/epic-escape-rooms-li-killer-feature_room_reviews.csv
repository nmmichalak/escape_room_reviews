"Escape room ""Killer Feature"" by Epic Escape Rooms LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/epic-escape-rooms-li-killer-feature,0,Just tried it today and it was really fun. The owners were awesome. I could really tell they had fun putting everything together. My girlfriend and I tried the Killer Instinct room and it was really challenging. We barely came out alive and it left us mentally drained. If you’re looking for a challenging one then I definitely recommend this one. I can’t wait to go back and try the other rooms.

The owner and staff were so nice. We definitely want to come back to their other rooms. We've done a few escape rooms before and this is one of the best ones.

Came here last Friday to do the Killer Feature room. It was definitely hard but we escaped! Kat was really helpful when it came to booking the trip and the staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be back to do their other rooms.
