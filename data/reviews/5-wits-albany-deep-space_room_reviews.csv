"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by 5 Wits in Albany",https://worldofescapes.com/albany/quests/5-wits-albany-deep-space,0,This place is amazing. Did all three rooms with my friend and we nailed 2 outta 3. We are excited to go back and nail that last room that we failed at though!! These rooms are literally so much fun! I've never been more excited ever. The Deep Space one is by far my favorite. So excited to go back and do the rooms again. They also have an excellent staff on site. Very friendly and super helpful!

It was just the 2 of us and we had a great time doing the Tomb Adventure. We had so much fun we did Deep Space right after it and did really well (especially for only 2 people). Didn't have to join any other parties of people, which was nice since we left the kids with a sitter and wanted alone time. Very happy with the experience and will be back."
