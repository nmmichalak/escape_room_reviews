Moriarty’s room was a real mind bender and you have to be a thinker, outside of the box, in order to get your way out. But don’t OVER think it!!"
"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/the-great-escape-room-pittsburgh-professor-moriartys-gameroom,1,"Ben was our guide for our Escape Room and did an excellent job of announcing a revelation only after it was completely uncovered/discovered so that the rest of the group was aware of a new clue.  We signed up for the Moriarty room and enjoyed the working togetherness it provided for our group.  It was also nice that Ben offered historical Great Escape Pittsburgh facts on what other groups had done in certain situations, after we succeeded doing a section our way.Thanks again for a wonderful evening!"
"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/the-great-escape-room-pittsburgh-professor-moriartys-gameroom,2,My group escaped the Gameroom. We have escaped many escape rooms together and this one was a good challenge which we loved. There were plenty of puzzles so each one of us had the opportunity to contribute.
