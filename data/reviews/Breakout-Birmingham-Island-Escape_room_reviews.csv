Escaped just in time! Everyone had a great time. 2 other groups of coworkers enjoyed their rooms as well. Only 3 of 20 of us had done a breakout before. Several of the first-timers said they'd like to play again. Staff was friendly and helped make the game more enjoyable. Special thanks to Will, who helped us with the Island."

We did the Island Eacape and had a great adventure. It's hard to find something we all enjoy but this hit the mark! Our Game Master had perfect timing with her comments. We broke out with 9 minutes to spare. Hope to return for another adventure."

It was our first visit, and we will definitely be back! Island Escape was perfect for them. They loved all the details in the room and unlocking all the locks. Thanks for a great Sunday with the family."
