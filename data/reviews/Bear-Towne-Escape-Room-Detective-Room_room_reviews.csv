We had so much fun. We were in the deadly diagnosis room. The puzzles where challenging and had us think outside the box. We laughed and had many a ""duh"" moment, but truly enjoyed working together solving all the puzzles. The owner is amazing! He truly added to our great experience. My husband and I will be back, and this is definitely on the list of things to do when we have visitors."
