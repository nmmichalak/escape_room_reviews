"Escape room ""Beta Labs"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-puzzle-room-beta-labs,0,"These rooms are fantastic. They are well thought out, challenging, and rewarding. Captain Lockjaw, Madame Lumina, and the Pearled Pachyderm are really great for first timers or experienced puzzle room fans. The Beta Lab room is simply challenging - no antics, no frills, just boxes, locks, and puzzles so I don't recommend it for people looking for the more engaging/ theatrical experience. All in all, we were thrilled with all of these rooms and would gladly revisit if and when a new room is created."

Unfortunately, the Beta Labs room got the best of us and we couldn't get out lol! Well be back soon :) This was my very first escape room and it was amazing, couldn't have asked for a better experience!"

Four of us took on the Beta Labs room and we had a blast and even made it out alive. It was challenging, rewarding and required a complete team effort. Looking forward to escaping another room again soon."
