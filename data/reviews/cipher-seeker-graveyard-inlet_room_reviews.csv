"Escape room ""Graveyard Inlet"" by Cipher Seeker Room Escape Challenge in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/cipher-seeker-graveyard-inlet,0,"We played the Graveyard Inlet game. I liked how we were given clues via a computer monitor. It seemed less like getting ""cheats"" and more part of the game experience. Many of the puzzles were very clever. I would have liked to have a few more physical tasks to complete, but that won't keep me from coming back. I plan on trying the Framed game next month!"

It was such a great bonding experience and so interesting to see how we all contributed to escaping the Graveyard Inlet! We all highly recommend and are already planning to go back and do a different room in the Fall!
