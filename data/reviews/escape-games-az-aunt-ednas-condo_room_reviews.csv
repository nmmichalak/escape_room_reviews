"Escape room ""The Condo"" by Escape Games AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-games-az-aunt-ednas-condo,0,I'm not one to write reviews but the staff is super friendly and Aunt Edna's condo was way fun! I can't wait to go back and do a different one!
"Escape room ""The Condo"" by Escape Games AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-games-az-aunt-ednas-condo,1,We booked the Condo room for a little adult time away from the kids. Most of us had never done one before but everything was explained well and we had a blast. We will definitely be back!

The game had just the right amount of challenges for our group. I highly recommend for families with older and younger kids.

If you are a first time player-- this a great place to start playing. We played both Aunt Edna's and Quest for the Throne and were successful at both, but just barely. Locally owned and run. Aunt Edna's takes the cake for the most unique theme we've seen in a puzzle room. Great fun for friends or a date night. Check it out!"
