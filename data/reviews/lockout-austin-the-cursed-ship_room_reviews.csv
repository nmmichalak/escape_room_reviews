"Escape room ""The Cursed Ship"" by Lockout Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/lockout-austin-the-cursed-ship,0,We had an awesome time doing the Cursed Ship Room. Everyone I interacted with from booking to working with the actual day was very nice and accommodating. The room was very exciting and the clues were very thought out. We were able to escape with 10 minutes left! Definitely recommend doing an escape room here. It was tons of fun!

It's like those famous escape rooms but a little smaller. I went here with a group of friends booked the Shipwrecked room adventure.The one we did we only stayed in one room, but there were a lot of puzzles and riddles to solve in just one hour. It was better than we expected. They also give you hints and there are actor crew there that help explain things. We want to go again!"

Will def be back to do the others! It was fun, challenging, & a great new idea for date night. We were also impressed with the customer service. They even called us when we didn't make it right on time & helped us find the location since we got a little turned around. Excellent experience!"
