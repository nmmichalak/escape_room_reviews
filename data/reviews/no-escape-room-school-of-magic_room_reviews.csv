"Escape room ""School of Magic"" by No Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/no-escape-room-school-of-magic,0,My wife and two adult children had never tried an escape room before but were looking for some quality family time this weekend. We tried the School of Magic room at No Escape and had a blast. We almost completed it and Alex was an outstanding game master.

Rare to find great theming and not just boring number combinations all the time. 8.5/10 difficulty, very difficult. Also Alex is very handsome."

First time attempting an escape room. Had lots of fun! Cool room! Good thing we had our 3 kids ages 18 - 27 or we would still be there! LOL. Our guide (via walkie talkie) was of great assistance when needed. BTW-we completed it!
