"Escape room ""At Odds With The Gods"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-at-odds-with-the-gods,0,Really enjoyed this escape room and the 90 minute game time! Jamie and Dan were great hosts and we are looking forward to doing their next room. We managed to escape and used a few hints along the way. The puzzles were cool and I like that there weren't too many padlocks. Great job!

The owners and gamemaster were extremely accommodating for the exhausted 4-year-old with us. We will be back again, what a great experience!"

We tried their 90-minute At Odds With The Gods room, and we were so impressed. The decor was all awesome, it all fit the theme amazingly. All the puzzles were entertaining and fun, and their hint system was super cool. Dan and Jamie were awesome hosts. We will be back for their other rooms! Give them a try, you won't regret it."

It was the first 90-min room we’ve ever played and it definitely kept us on our toes! For two experienced players, this game definitely gave us some new puzzles we hadn’t seen and took us back to good old-fashioned mind puzzles. We can’t wait to go back and try the other games as we know we will love them too! Plus the owners are wonderful and definitely care about you having a great experience!"
