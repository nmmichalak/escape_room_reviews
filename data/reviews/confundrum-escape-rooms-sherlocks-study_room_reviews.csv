I would do this again in a heartbeat! We were able to solve the puzzle with less than 3 minutes to spare. "

We tried the Sherlock room and it was fun but we totally did it with a couple of hints of course. I enjoyed it! I heard from the owner that they are planning on adding additional rooms, so no need to fret in case you try out one room and want to try out another!This place is a good place to bring kids and family members or even a group of friends if you want to try this out! :)"
"Escape room ""Sherlock’s Study"" by Confundrum Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/confundrum-escape-rooms-sherlocks-study,2,This was a lot of fun and a great experience! We did the Sherlock Holmes room. It was hard but so cool. The owners were awesome to us and helped us understand everything in the end. Will definitely be going back to do that one and the other rooms as well.
