"Escape room ""DeRailed"" by Breakout in Tuscaloosa",https://worldofescapes.com/tuscaloosa/quests/breakout-tuscaloosa-derailed,0,We had such a fun time breaking out! We had a big group of 18 so we split between Hotel Horror and Derailed. The rooms were VERY well done and the people running the rooms do an amazing job! We can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!
