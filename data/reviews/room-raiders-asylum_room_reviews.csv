"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-asylum,0,"We all had a fantastic time trying to figure out how all of the clues went together to solve each area. My 10, 17 and 28 year olds ALL loved it and we worked together really well as a team! So much fun! We’ll definitely be back to try the other rooms. Thank you JAMES for helping to make our experience fun and successful :) See you soon! "
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Room Raiders in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/room-raiders-asylum,1,The best escape game I've played so far. The game was fun and very creative. The design of the room was very detailed and of good quality. I felt completely immersed into the theme of the room. Plus they had some really cool features that I've never seen before.

The creepiness factor is off the charts. Everything is well done from the music to the room setup. Highly recommended.
