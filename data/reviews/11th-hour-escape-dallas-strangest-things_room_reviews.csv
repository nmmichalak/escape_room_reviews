"Escape room ""The Upside Down"" by 11th Hour Escape in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/11th-hour-escape-dallas-strangest-things,0,"I've been to several escape rooms and this was not one of the better ones. The room was ok and we liked that it was pretty tied to Stranger Things, but there were some disappointing factors. This was clearly created on a low budget. The hints that were provided were not very helpful and there was no ability to confirm codes. There was also no timer to indicate how much time was left for the group. For the price, I would not recommend this escape room."

We are all fans of the show and loved the design of the room. We will definitely do another escape room at 11th Hour!

Went with my work family for our Christmas party and everyone really enjoyed it. None of us had done one beforehand. We made it out in 61 mins. They worked with us and gave us extra hints. We went into the Stranger Things room and they made it very authentic. Felt like you were in the show.

The employee made a good first impression! We did the Strangest Things room and finished with 8 minutes to spare! Will definitely be going there to do the fallout one sometime!
