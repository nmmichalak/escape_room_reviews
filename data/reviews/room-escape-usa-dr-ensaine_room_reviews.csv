"Escape room ""Dr. Ensaine"" by Room Escape USA in Richmond (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/richmond-v-a/quests/room-escape-usa-dr-ensaine,0,"Great experience. The room was great, very well done and very challenging. More importantly the staff was fantastic! We brought our volleyball team (Ten 13-14 year old girls) and we initially reserved a room that, upon closer inspection, wouldnâ€™t be appropriate for our girls. The staff worked with us and allowed us to change rooms. To make matters even more challenging, one of our girls was concerned that the second room would be too scary. They were very understanding and compassionate, explaining what to expect, even giving us a peek into the room. I would highly recommend this location and this staff. They were great!"

The atmosphere and puzzles were top-notch, and we had a blast trying to escape. We needed a few hints, but we made it out just in time with just the two of us. We will definitely be back for their other room!"
