"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,1,"Loved This! Great series of puzzles and good use of the space to tie the whole room together. Really enjoyed the Bunker and will return for the Bank Vault. Really enjoyed having Noah for the hints. He was able to provide just enough of a push in the right direction. Can't wait for the next visit! Also, extremely easy to get to and find."
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,2,"Very rarely do I leave reviews for places, but my experience here last weekend absolutely justifies one. I had a chance to try to escape the Cold War Bunker, and quite simply it was one of the most fun things I have ever done. The staff are incredibly friendly, the rooms are built and themed like mini soundstages, and the puzzles are genuinely difficult, but not impossible. It all adds to an awesome hour of puzzle solving and team building. I paid $33 to spend an hour frustrated and failing, and I can't wait to go back for more. If you derive any sort of joy from problem solving and working a riddle over and over until you finally solve it, you NEED to check this place out.RoomEscape LA, I will be back."
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,3,"My group did both rooms, and BOTH are so perfect. The exact level of difficulty and ingenuity that you want in an escape room.We liked the bunker more -- escaped with ten minutes to go. It was impeccably decorated and had a good mix of logic and physical challenges. The bank was also so fun -- the flashlights were a good touch, and this room had a great multi-section layout. Escaped with ZERO seconds left on the clock!! Challenging but not undoable!"
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,4,"I've never tried anything like this. I'm not the least bit into video games but this was one of the coolest experience I've had in recent weeks. Just go with an open mind and be ready to think. My team did the cold war bunker. Allegedly, that's the easier of the two rooms, but we certainly found it challenging! One hour went by way too fast! The cool thing about doing this, is that for one hour you are completely immersed in what's going on around you. No phone or outside distraction competing for your attention. I thought of nothing but the task at hand the entire time we were locked in there and it was a very nice change of pace. The crew there is fabulous! Jo is so sweet and gave a nice little pep talk before you enter the bunker. Listen to what she says - she gives a few helpful hints that you're likely to forget once the action starts. I had a slight problem signing up online but she was more than helpful and took care of everything right away. Looking forward to going back and trying the bank vault!"

It was one of the best exhibitions of teamwork I had ever seen. We each had different positions, 1 person was a scribe, another would organize clues and process them, another would focus on the puzzles, one person was the leader making executive decisions, another person was constantly scouting the room for things others missed or things that changed in the room etc. We all had a lot of fun, and each person contributed something that helped us get to the next level, it wasn't just 1 person solving everything. Believe me when I say, every single position matters. Irene was a great host. (I think that was her name). She had a great sense of humor, and even joked with us when we we're doing something wrong. As the last 10 minutes hit the clock things got intense with the last puzzle. Finally we solved it, and saved the world! You're welcome."
