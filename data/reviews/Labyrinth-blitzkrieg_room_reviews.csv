This was our first escape room experience so we weren't exactly sure what to expect, but it was even better than we imagined! Tricky puzzles, but not impossible. Highly recommended, a fun activity to do with friends! Extremely friendly and helpful staff as well! We already can't wait to do the second room! Thanks guys!!"
"Escape room ""Blitzkrieg"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Labyrinth-blitzkrieg,6,"Great for team building, did this with 8 people, half from work and half friends. Would definitely recommend this place! The level of detail is amazing and real tailors the experience to the players. Anyone who enjoys puzzle and board games should definitely give this a shot. I would recommend not maxing out the room size as it can be confusing with a large number of people, and communicate, communicate, communicate!We will ALL be coming back soon for sure!Very friendly staff, great ideas, completely worth it!"
