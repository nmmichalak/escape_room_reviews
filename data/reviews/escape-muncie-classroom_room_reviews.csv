"Escape room ""Classroom"" by Escape Muncie in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/escape-muncie-classroom,0,Loved it! Very creative and strategic puzzles. It was so fun to do the puzzles and clues. Our group of 3 did the classroom and almost solved it. Can't wait to go back again for the other rooms!

We had a group of seven, and the room kept all of us engaged and working together on our escape! Bonus: the owners are incredibly nice and proceeds support their favorite charity."
