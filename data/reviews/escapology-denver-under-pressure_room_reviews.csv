"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-under-pressure,0,"Really impressed by this place!!First, I really appreciate that they have a bar and food on site. So show up early, have a drink, grab some food. We had a variety of apps and some beer. Ok then we did Under Pressure. This is one of their hardest rooms and we didn't make it out; bring a strong team if you're going to get this one. We have been to several different companies around town and this was one of the best. Two things we really appreciated the most:The room/tasks were well built and clean. There is nothing worse than a run-down room with crapped out locks or letters that have been rubbed off. This room had very good locks and tasks. So you knew that when a lock wasn't opening it was your fault, not just a bad product. Also, the tasks were very creative. Some more than others but we really liked a handful of the tasks. They were hard but still felt solvable. Sometimes you finish a room and realize you NEVER would have solved that. That's disappointing. This place didn't feel like that. The puzzles were certainly tough but with good communication and thinking we're all very doable. Overall this was a high-quality place with well thought out tasks. And they even have beer and food too! Thanks!"
"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-under-pressure,1,"Some friends and I were visiting Denver for a show at Red Rocks and decided to do an escape room at Escapology the day after. Most of us were still recuperating from the night before when we arrived at 330 PM but that didn't stop us from taking on the hardest room there. We chose ""Under Pressure"" which was a submarine themed Room. I thought the staff did a great job of explaining things  and the room was designed in a cool way. I hesitate to explain further because I would hate to give anything away for future players. The game was super engaging and really fun! We didn't escape :( but we were on the last puzzle so that's something? Also! They were doing a cross promotion with the Denver Museum of Nature & Science and we found four free tickets in one of our clue boxes. That was an unexpected, yet really great surprise!"
"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapology-denver-under-pressure,2,"Went here for a team building event with my company. It was a great experience. Has a bar and food for before or after you escape (or not.) I didn't have any drinks, but we did have the catered taco bar, which was top notch.My group did the Under Pressure room, which is the hardest one at this location. We were told the room has a 9% success rate. We finished it we 10 minutes left on the clock. The initial puzzles were fairly easy, but became more complicated towards the end. This room was really engaging, and had a good story to go along with it. The one thing I didn't like was that you simply ""escape"" out the same door you come in, which was physically unlocked the whole time in case some needed to get out for an emergency. Overall it was a good experience, and I would definitely go back."
