"Escape room ""Camp Echo"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-camp-echo,2,"We're enthusiasts from Ohio. Stopped here while visiting family and got them hooked! The Escape Goat is the real deal. If we ever fulfill our dream of running our own place, this is how we'd do it. Awesome puzzles, even for all skill levels and ages. Our kids loved the Camp Echo room. The quality of these rooms is amazing - not your thrift store props and concrete floors like most! The in-room actors were great! These owners are the best! Can't wait to stop in for new rooms the next time we're in town."

I brought my wife with some friends for her birthday and we had a blast!! Camp Echo is a very unique room experience complete with a Camp Counselor who is there just in case you need clues as well as to keep the story flowing. We can't wait to go back and try ""Area 51"". If you are looking for something fun to do, try Escape Goat, you'll love it too."
