I was nervous because I thought my anxiety would get the best of me, but my group was paired with another group and we worked well together. We did the Psych 102: Broken Mind room and actually got out with a record time for that room. It was amazing and I can say that it will not be my last panic room. The staff were great as well. They were friendly and gave great instruction for those of us who were new to the event."
