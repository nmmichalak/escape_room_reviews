"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-museum-heist,0,"I went through the Museum Heist in a bachelorette party, and the 4 of us made it through the room with only seconds to spare. It was definitely a real challenge, impossible to do with only 1 person. 4 was a good number of people for it not to be chaotic madness but also enough brains to solve it together. We did get a handful of hints from the girl who works there, who was kind enough to give us hints when we were close to guessing, without putting a hard limit on it. That makes the room much more fun!"
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-museum-heist,1,Loved this place and already have an appointment to go back and try a different room.   We did the Museum Heist room and had a great time.  Everything from the booking until the check out process was top notch and I highly recommend this place.   Online booking was easy.  I used a Groupon to make it more affordable and it was easy.  The facility is modern and clean.  They have computerized check in that only takes a minute.  Everyone was super friendly and professional.   The intro made sense and was brief.  The room was awesome.  Super inventive without being obscure.  Well laid out and all kinds of fun twists.  We escaped with actually a lot of time to spare and got lots of kudos from the staff.  The photo booth at the end captured the moment and we all loved it.

It was me (23 y/o), my sister (21 y/o), my mom and my brother (14 y/o). It was really challenging and we broke out with 2 minutes left. The staff was very help, kind and talkative. This is definitely a really fun activity that's different than your run of the mill experiences. Loved it and would recommend!"

We did the Museum Heist and it was really complex and interesting. We had a group for a bachelor party (mostly first timers) and the clues/puzzles were really unique. Our Game Master was fun to work with and made it all around enjoyable"

The Museum Heist game was great! Can't wait to go back. These guys are so accommodating, I give them 5 stars on their customer service alone. Only one person in our group had done an escape room adventure before and she said this place was even better than the first one she went to. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
