"Escape room ""Dungeon VII"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-dungeon,0,I had my first experience with an escape room yesterday and had way more fun than I expected. We did the Dungeon which was the most difficult but so much fun! I am recommending all my friends to them and hope to get a group together soon to go back.

My friend and I were able to try out the Dungeon VII room, and it was an absolute blast! The decorations in the room were splendid and the room itself was definitely a fun challenge. The puzzles and challenges really put our group to the test, and although we did not escape, we had a great time. Well worth the price, cannot wait to come back and try again!"

When we walked in, we felt warm, and welcome -and we had a toddler with us (which personally, I do not recommend for your first time) and was immediately welcomed with opened arms. Very family friendly. We were able to escape the dungeon - the puzzles were challenging, and the detail was amazing. We were blown away. We have done over 90 rooms and that room was one of the top. We are very excited to go back and complete the others. Thanks for a great experience!"
