Adrenaline rush and lots of good team building/collaboration. We did the dark sector which we were in a spaceship trying to fix to get back on earth, while a creepy science experiment was still in the shuttle. Loved the props, set up, and displays. Great a creating a fun and realistic environment. We barely made it out by the hair of our chinny chin chin. The first 15-20 minutes were wasted because we couldn't figure where to begin, as all of us were new to escape rooms. Vague clues given so it was tough to get a grasp on things. Once we figured out first clue, things started rolling in more smoothly."

Anyway, dark sector is one of the best ambiance rooms I’ve ever done.  The puzzles are a little confusing, but we managed to escape and had a blast.  The environment and decorations are absolute top notch."
