"Escape room ""The Alchemist"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-alchemist,0,Went Friday night for my friend's birthday. It was a group of 6 of us. We didn't complete the Alchemist room but it was super fun. I want to do every room now. Great group of people we were paired with also. Good team effort. Fun evening.

We did the Alchemist and enjoyed the puzzles and the room setup, staff, and easy parking. It is downtown, but it was fine. Definitely worth the money for the uniqueness, creativity, and knowledgeable staff. Everyone agreed it was worth it for something special."
