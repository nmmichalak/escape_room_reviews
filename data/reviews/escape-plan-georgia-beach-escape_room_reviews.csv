We did the Beach Escape, and it was amazing. The puzzles were strong, the story was immersive, and the people were very friendly. It went well enough that we are booking a large group to come back for more!"

The staff was super nice and excited to have us there. The rooms had such fun themes, and great attention to detail and I wanted to try them all. We did the Beach room and solved it with 53 seconds left to spare. It was a little rush every time we solved a clue, and super exciting when we got the final clue solved as the clock was ticking down. Win or lose, it's a fun way to spend an afternoon or evening and I highly recommend."

The entire staff went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was perfect. We did not finish our Beach Room but we thoroughly enjoyed it. We will go back and next with more than just the two of us. Thank you all so much.
