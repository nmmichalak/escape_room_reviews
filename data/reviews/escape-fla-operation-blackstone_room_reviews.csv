"Escape room ""Operation Blackstone"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-operation-blackstone,0,"We did the Operation Blackstone room and it was hard but not too hard! It was really fun and there were lots of clues to find. This is a great place for families, birthday parties, even work functions! It is family owned and operated and the owner is super nice and helpful! There are options to have hints during the one hour in the room which is great. All in all this is a super great escape room!"
"Escape room ""Operation Blackstone"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-operation-blackstone,1,"Fantastic experience all around. We did Operation Blackstone. This was my 3rd time doing an escape room and this one really felt like the story of the room drove the puzzles. A nice twist for this room was that you weren’t actually escaping the room, you were completing a mission. Bonus points to the owner who worked with me ahead of time to have a personalized puzzle built in for my wife’s birthday that contained her birthday card. She really thought that was cool."

Had family fly down to visit and went here looking to bond and have fun. It ended up being more than we could've imagined. Thanks for hosting the event for us, we will definitely be back!"
