Mary was our staff person, she was excellent. Had an A+ time, highly recommend to anyone considering.And note: this isn't a scary zombie thing. That's the other edition. This is just searching for clues/riddles with a 60-minute constraint, no zombie or scary anything.5 stars! And big congrats to Mary!"

Jen, our escape guide was great. Very enthusiastic. She helped steer us back in the right direction if we were veering too far away. The room was really clever. I wish we could have spent more time after we escaped, just enjoying all the memorabilia."
