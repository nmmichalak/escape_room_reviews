"Escape room ""Project Iceworm"" by 21 Keys Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/21-keys-escape-rooms-project-iceworm,0,"It was my boyfriend's and my first times doing an escape room and we had a great time. We did the Project Iceworm room which I would highly recommend. The room is dimly lit and you have to search around with flashlights for clues. We thought the puzzles were really creative and challenging. Since it was just the two of us and both of our first times we didn't make it out in time but we still had so much fun. The couple running the place are also super nice and create the rooms themselves, which is super neat. Can't wait to go again!"

I expected something cheesy (think like murder mystery dinners) but this was so well thought out and executed that I'm still thinking about it 3 days later.I booked the Project Iceworm room for me, my mom, and my sister and we ended up having the room to ourselves (probably not peak hours for this type of activity). This was the most difficult room, which I knew and we were warned about again before entering, but we're puzzle/game people so we wanted something challenging. The room allows a max of 6 players and I was worried about not having enough people for it since we only had 3 but unless we had someone experienced with escape rooms I don't think additional bodies/brains would have made it any better. The story was not only entertaining but so well translated into a game and the time (and money) that they had to put into the design and technology of the room is evident and impressive.We ended up asking for three clues and were impressed with how they were delivered. I expected to just get direction via an intercom or even to have someone walk in and guide us but the clues were integrated into the design of the room and were gently guidance, not just ""do this next"" which made having to get a clue less disappointing.We didn't solve the room but were told we made it about 75% of the way through. Honestly, solving it would have been nice but the hour of entertainment (which FLEW by) was worth what we paid and more. If we weren't so hungry I would have asked if we could stay and do the Speakeasy room which looked very cool, too.btw, there are lockers for your jackets, purses, etc so you don't have to deal with those while you're in the room which was a nice touch."

It is fairly new and the woman who runs the place is so nice and you can tell she really cares about what she's made here. We did the Project Iceworm room which was technologically incredible and honestly so well put together it was astounding...by far the best escape room experience myself and my group have collectively ever had. We were so into this room that we followed it up immediately after with another room called The Speakeasy. Though less challenging overall, still very well thought out and definitely would be a great first introduction to escape rooms. Please consider coming here, I promise you will not regret it. A+"
