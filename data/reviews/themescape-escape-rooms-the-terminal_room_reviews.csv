They put so much effort into building a quality room, the puzzles are challenging but make for an experience you'll want to come back for!"
"Escape room ""The Terminal"" by Themescape Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/themescape-escape-rooms-the-terminal,1,The Terminal is a super fun room. You really feel like you're in a NY subway station and the puzzles are really cool - they use loads of technology! Really unique and entertaining. Turned me on to escape rooms - can't wait to try more!
"Escape room ""The Terminal"" by Themescape Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/themescape-escape-rooms-the-terminal,2,"Our group of 5 did The Terminal room and had a blast. We were so close to finishing! I liked that it was just our group, so we were working with only people we know. Three of the five of us had no experience in an escape room and two of us had a little experience – like one or two times. This was a tricky one – especially finding that first clue. I will say there were a couple of items in the room that had NOTHING to do with the progression of the escape and that threw us because we were sure they were some sort of clue and actually caused us to miss the most important clue. But, the people are super nice and do a great job of explaining what to expect and are good with providing clues when we got stuck."
