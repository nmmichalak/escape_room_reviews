"Escape room ""Forest of Fortune"" by RI Riddle Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/ri-riddle-room-forest-of-fortune,0,"Another fantastic experience! We went today to their new location and had such a great time! We did the Forest of Fortune and the room itself was so cute, they didn't leave one detail out when creating it. Then, all the puzzles were challenging and fun to solve as well. It was probably one of the best all around rooms we have ever done. The owner was also our game master and was so kind to give us extra time to complete the room and plenty of hints to keep us on the right track. We will be back to do the other rooms that we haven't done very soon."
"Escape room ""Forest of Fortune"" by RI Riddle Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/ri-riddle-room-forest-of-fortune,1,"My ""team"" and I have done all of the rooms at RI Riddle Room, and have not been disappointed yet. In fact, the experiences get better with each room as the business gains more knowledge and experience. We're really excited about what lies ahead for their new location; Forest of Fortune was fantastic. It is evident that the team at RI Riddle Room is very passionate about what they are doing. The rooms are well designed (both aesthetically and mechanically), puzzles are intelligently crafted - making them challenging but not overly obscure - and they clearly have put thought into the story lines behind each room. Really, I have nothing negative to say about RI Riddle Room, and encourage everyone to give them a try."
