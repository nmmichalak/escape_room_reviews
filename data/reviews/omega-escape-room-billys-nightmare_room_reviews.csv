"Escape room ""Billy's Nightmare"" by Omega Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/omega-escape-room-billys-nightmare,2,We went to Billy's Nightmare escape room at Omega in Hamburg. It was a ton of fun. Very clever and tricky-- but they do give you some clues which helped our group get out with seconds to spare. The staff was helpful and energetic. Would recommend.
