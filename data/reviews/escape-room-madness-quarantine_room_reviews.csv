We played Quarantine and it was amazing. The scenic and puzzles were excellent. We managed to escape with 27 seconds left, it is crazy. The Game Master was amazing, he helped us with clues and hints just when we needed them the most. We highly recommend Escape Room Madness if you are in NYC. They are located in Midtown in KoreaTown. A lot of good food places nearby as well."

He was clear and concise in his explanation and the clues we used. We did quarantine which was one of the most interactive and well themed rooms I've done. 100% would recommend!
