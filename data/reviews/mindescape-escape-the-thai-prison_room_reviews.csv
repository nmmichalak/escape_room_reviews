"Escape room ""Escape Thai Prison"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-the-thai-prison,0,"In my escape room experience of 212 games, Thai Prison and Jack the Ripper are among The best and most poslished games I have seen. Thai Prison, being a standout in the prison game genre, is an intense and immersive experience that requires players to think as though they were actually escaping a prison, creating a uniquely immersive and interactive game. Jack the Ripper is an eerie and atmospheric horror game requiring players to puzzle through the age old mystery of the identity of Jack the Ripper in a way that feels organic and realistic, while being a cerebral and challenging puzzle game. Intense, immersive, and intelligent, Mindescape is a venue so devoted to their craft, and this devotion shines in each puzzle and interaction of both games. The gamemasters were also excellent, shout outs to Maya and Cameron for being particularly observant over our group and giving us great hints. The introduction for Thai Prison aced by Maya was humorous and a nice touch, and Cameron was incredibly helpful in working with my solo run of Jack the Ripper, acting as an invaluable helper when I did not have enough hands to succeed. The designer of the games was on site and incredibly friendly, able to adapt Jack the Ripper to accommodate the aforementioned solo run. Mindescape is venue not to be missed, and I would heavily suggest checking out both games if you are ever in the area. You will not be disappointed."
"Escape room ""Escape Thai Prison"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-the-thai-prison,1,Came from Toronto for a conference and asked a few friends which escape room was the best. Mindescape was recommened as the new room in town. We have several good rooms in Toronto but this one is certainly is THE BEST I've done. The variety and originality of the puzzles as well as the flow of the room was absolutley flawless! We were paired with another group which were not familiar with the concept and they really enjoyed as well.Also Isabela the game master was really nice and. I would recommend anyone that likes room escape games to try them out.! Thanks Mindescape!
"Escape room ""Escape Thai Prison"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-the-thai-prison,2,So much fun!!! Great set-up and the staff amaizing. We had a blast. I can't wait for the new room. ðŸ˜ƒ
"Escape room ""Escape Thai Prison"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-the-thai-prison,3,"Wow! still have a high from this room! I have done half a dozen in Philly and NY area (from Allen town) and honestly this one is my favorite so far! I was sceptical about those 5 star reviews all over, because nobody is perfect, but  their Thai Prison room definetly comes close as far as story and immersion. The puzzles are not your typical count-objects-math-brain-teasers style. You really need to think like somebody who is trying to escape, to complete this one. Dont overthink and you'll do alright. Our time was 44 minutes with no clues, best time that week!Can't wait for Jack The ripper to come out!"

She immersed us into the world of the Thai prison before we even got into the room. The puzzles were exciting and challenging, but not impossible. All the clues were really creative and unique. Very much looking forward to their next room. "

I spoke to Gill on the phone and he made the entire event smooth and effortless. We booked the entire place and they helped us set up food and drinks. My team does not stop talking about how much fun they had. It was a definite added value to my team and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take her team to the next level !Jean
