"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-the-code,0,"We had soooo much fun! We did The Code room, and we solved it with 10 minutes to spare, but had a ton of fun doing it. I think this room was one of the easier ones. You are being watched while you are inside the room, and the Escapology staff will send you hints occasionally if you are on the wrong track."

"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-the-code,3,Had an amazing time. The escape room was challenging and fun. Five of us attempted to crack the Code and we successfully escaped with a little over 10 minutes. Everyone agreed it was an amazing experience. Even the waiting room was elegant and well designed. Definitely worth checking out while in Las Vegas.
