"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/museum-room,1,Prison Break was definitely a challenge and had a very well thought through game and set up. Intense and on the edge at times pushed to the very limit of your time. Great use of your mind and puzzle solving capabilities. Would definitely recommend this room!

We did the Prison Break and it was great. We finished with less than 9 minutes. Great in using your critical thinking skills."
