"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-operation-casino,0,I really liked that some of the clues were tied to the theme of the room. Sometimes the puzzles and clues are totally unrelated to the theme and the theme is more decorative than anything. That was not the case for this room. Having some knowledge of casino games is beneficial though they do give instructions for those with no knowledge of how the games work.

Concept was challenging but doable. Game master Joe was the BEST. He made us feel like geniuses after we broke out, referencing specific things we did particularly well. I want to go back and do the other rooms!"

It was definitely an enjoyable place to spend a considerable amount of time at! The rooms are all themed differently, and come with their own new set of challenges and quirks. The attention to detail was spectacular, the puzzles were top-notch, and the decor helped build the sense of being in another time and place.  There was honestly never a dull moment while we were in their rooms! We can't wait for them to release more, because we can't wait to go back! Special shout out to Peter, Nick, Spencer and Meg who put up with our team, as well as helped us maintain our 10/10 room winning streak for my birthday weekend!"
