"Escape room ""The Last Hour of the Titanic"" by Locked Room Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/locked-room-omaha-the-last-hour-of-the-titanic,0,We did a team outing here and it was so much fun. We divided into two teams: Team Titanic and Team Fresh Meat. Both teams made it out with 7 and 3 minutes to spare. The Titanic room was well thought out and more difficult than other rooms Iâ€™ve done. I definitely recommend and would love to do the other rooms.

We chose the Titanic room, and were so excited to go. You are never sure if something will live up to your expectations... Locked Room Omaha did! There were 4 of us (3 teens and myself), and it was so much fun to do this together! Can't wait to try another room!"
