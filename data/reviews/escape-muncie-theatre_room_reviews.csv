"Escape room ""Theatre"" by Escape Muncie in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/escape-muncie-theatre,0,"We completed the ""Theatre"" escape room and boy was it fun and challenging! We had never been to an escape room before and wasn't sure what to expect. Jen, the host, made the experience very fun and kept us on track. She even made sure to keep our 8-year-old involved and he loved it. The rooms are neatly themed and well-thought out. The game is very fun and supports a great cause!"

We did the Theater room - It was a real challenge, but we all worked together and made it out in 51 minutes! Best thing wev ever done together as a family! I've heard the other rooms are even better! Got to try them all!"

Really tests your ability to work as a team under pressure, and is great for people who enjoy solving puzzles. I would recommend it to any and every-one! Can't wait to try the other two rooms."

"Escape room ""Theatre"" by Escape Muncie in Muncie",https://worldofescapes.com/muncie/quests/escape-muncie-theatre,4,Two of my friends and I did The Theatre and The Mansion today. The staff was fantastic and really well organized and energetic. The rooms were put together with thought and challenging without being too frustrating and overwhelming. It was a blast and a wonderful experience. We can't wait to come back and do the rest of them. Great bonding activity for family and friends even if you have a smaller group than recommended.
