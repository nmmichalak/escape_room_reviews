"Escape room ""Titanic Time"" by Code Rulers Escape Room in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/code-rulers-escape-room-titanic-time,0,"The customer service I received was fine. I did the Titanic Time Escape Room. I saw it on Groupon, but the price was actually cheaper on their website.The escape room itself was lacking. I've done several others and this one felt incomplete and cheap. The room itself was a 'limited light' experience, which I'm okay with. What wasn't cool was that all of the lights were completely out of theme. We had regular flashlights instead of lanterns, and the light on the desk was a regular desk lamp like mine at home. I feel like the limited lighting was put into place to hide the cheap quality of the materials used. For a ship boiler room, it looked a lot like an office.  One area even had a map of the ship taped to the wall. With bright green duct tape. There was a door with writing DO NOT OPEN (and not as a part of the puzzle...they just didn't want the door open). One of the props even had a ""This is a prop do not remove bottom"" taped to it. Not on the bottom, nope, right across the top. The escape room also had a large trunk that faintly smelled of cat pee when open. As far as props and clues went, there were several broken props and items. One of the clues was supposed to be looked through but it was so beaten up it was useless. It had a LOT of the exact same type of lock/puzzle. Like... there were key locks, number locks, and push locks. Even my sister, who hasn't done an escape room before, commented on the number of boxes and locks. Though there were a couple exceptions, many of the clues and items needed were in exactly sequential order. You open box A, find a clue for box B. Box B helps you open box C...etc. This could have been solved by one person working alone, there was really no need for a group. Finding the starting point was the only really HARD part of it. Save your money. This one is not worth the $15 pricetag, especially when  you can find a MUCH more immersive one for $10 more. And yes, we finished, with almost 10 minutes to spare. "
