Escape Room in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/trapped-pirate-tavern,2,"I live right down the street but just found out about this place a week ago. Went to check out the Pirate room. Definitely want more than 2 people for that one, we got pretty far but didn't quite finish. It was an absolute blast, regardless... the production quality was fantastic and the entire experience was very immersive. I'll definitely be back to try one of the other rooms another time."
