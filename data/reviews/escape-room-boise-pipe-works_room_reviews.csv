The only thing I would change is the concept of not having a leaderboard, I find that enjoyable to shoot for."

It was fun doing the pipe works room and it was a blast working together and seeing who could figure stuff out quickly. This was my first escape room and I don't think it was incredibly difficult , but challenging enough that we couldn't just fly through the room. If you've never tried an escape room it was a lot of fun and you should try it too!"
