"Escape room ""The Forgotten Pharaoh"" by Escape Games at The River in Rancho Mirage",https://worldofescapes.com/rancho-mirage/quests/escape-games-at-the-river-the-forgotten-pharaoh,0,"So much fun! We did the Pharaoh's challenge, I can't remember the exact name, but it was a lot of fun and very challenging. My family and friends, all nine of us, made it out of the room in 53 minutes while using for clues. I feel like we are closer as a group then we were before. It was a great team building exercise."

It's slightly more expensive than Los Angeles, but you get a very high quality experience. We finished the Pharaoh game with 30 seconds to spare with 6 people and it was the perfect amount of difficulty. I would highly recommend."

I was new to escape rooms before I found this place, and now I'm hooked. The owners (Charlie and Mia) are very friendly, the location is perfect and the entire experience is very well organized. The best part is that the puzzles were quite tough but fun! Specifically, the Forgotten Pharaoh -- which was my first room ever -- was a BLAST! Overall Escape Games at the River delivered an experience that has me wanting more!!"
