"Escape room ""Trapped in a Room with a Zombie"" by Room Escape Adventures in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/trapped-with-zombie-chicago,6,"great way to spend an hour or so--puzzles were challenging for us but not impossible. Room is not very big, so with 8 other people theres a lot of jostling. and with people running and jumping to escape the zombie, this can be a physical game"

I went with my husband, his 2 sisters and their husbands. We were with 4 other people we didn't know...but that did not matter!! Once we got in that room and the door was locked.. BAM...IT WAS ON!!! We worked together solved the puzzles and if only...if only we had a few more seconds we would have escaped!!!!! We so cannot wait to do this again!! STILL EXCITED AND STILL REELING FROM THIS EXPERIENCE!!! A HUGE shout out to STACY AND MIKE for the awesome time!!! What a fun and grand date night to end our first ever WALKING DEAD DAY!!!"
