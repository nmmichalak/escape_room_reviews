"Escape room ""Little Candy Shop Of Horrors"" by Urban Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/zescape-little-candy-shop-of-horrors,0,We were hesitant to try such a newly opened place but boy did they deliver! We did the Candy shop of horrors and it was amazing! The clues were definitely hard and I loved the fact that it wasn’t just find a key and open a box like a lot of them are. The different elements for clues were pretty difficult and so much fun. My favorite room so far out of all the ones I’ve done. Can’t wait to try another at Zescape!
"Escape room ""Little Candy Shop Of Horrors"" by Urban Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/zescape-little-candy-shop-of-horrors,1,We did the candy shop room. It was one of the better escape rooms we've done. There were several different kinds of puzzles and not just a bunch of padlock keys. I think we were one of the first groups to do this room and they had a couple of bugs to work out but we'll go back.

This was the hardest escape room, and because no one was scheduled after us, they let us continue after our time limit was up if we wanted to. We definitely needed hints and even managed to solve 2 of the puzzles accidentally (thinking we were clever until later). We enjoyed the theme and found the puzzles challenging but had fun. The only issue we had was finding the location in a complex of office buildings. It's worth the effort though! I look forward to going back when I'm in town again to try the other rooms."
