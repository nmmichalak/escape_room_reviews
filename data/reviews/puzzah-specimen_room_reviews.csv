"Escape room ""Specimen"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-specimen,0,Specimen and the Curse at this location are just AWFUL. Wish they would trade these rooms out. Try M.A.S.K and Hive Mind here and skip these two. 
"Escape room ""Specimen"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-specimen,1,Went here last minute. We did Specimen which is not typical of escape rooms that we have done in the past. No locks or areas where small groups work alone. This is all or nothing. We would go back for sure!
"Escape room ""Specimen"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-specimen,2,I would recommend the SPECIMEN room for all around family fun. The combination of cleanliness and new technology really gave off a Disney-like feel. The room was challenging and beautifully built!! Great job Puzzah!! Looking forward to trying the next two rooms planned to open at the new location!
