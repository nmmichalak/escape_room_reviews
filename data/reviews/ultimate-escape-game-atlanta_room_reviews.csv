"Escape room ""Atlanta"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/ultimate-escape-game-atlanta,0,"Wow! What an amazing experience we had last evening at the Ultimate Escape Game Atlanta. With just 1 minute and 5 seconds to spare we completed The Vault and found the Faberge egg. There were 7 of us all family members. This business was highly organized from the moment you registered to the end of the game. It was challenging, but so much fun. We will definitely return to try other rooms."

"Escape room ""Atlanta"" by Ultimate Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/ultimate-escape-game-atlanta,4,"We did the Atlanta room with 12 people. There was not enough space for all 12 of us to be involved in the clue solving so it was really fun for some and really not fun for others. We were a group of 8 and got partnered with a group of 4 - this part you can't control...and because it was obvious that there were too many people, it ""felt"" like they were willing to sacrifice a player's experience to put more people in the room for $$$."
