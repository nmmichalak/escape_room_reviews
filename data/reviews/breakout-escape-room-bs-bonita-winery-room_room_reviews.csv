"Escape room ""Bonita Winery Room"" by Brainstorm Escape Room Bonita Springs in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/breakout-escape-room-bs-bonita-winery-room,0,"I have done a few rooms now, and believe me - this is harder than it looks. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the level of difficulty ranges depending on which room you do. I was able to complete the Winery by myself, but you need as many extra minds as you can get. I tried Dinner party with my family and Mirror Mirror with my sisters and it didn't end well. The rooms definitely require critical thinking skills, attention to detail and trying not to over think the clues. Overall it is such a great experience, I know that I will be back in the future to try all of the other rooms and to hopefully complete the Dinner party and Mirror Mirror. Bring your whole family! It's so much fun and even if you don't escape you take a cool picture at the end."

The owner and the associate Danielle were wonderful! Even though we didn't escape the wine room (as much as we tried with no help!), it was a blast and we will definitely be going back! You won't be disappointed! Thanks again ladies for a fun-filled afternoon!"

We had a great time in the Wine Cellar room, but we were unsuccessful at breaking out! We will definitely come back and try again. The owners were awesome! Thanks for a great time!"

For our first escape room we were only two minutes away from making it out! The staff was amazing and very informative. We will all be back to do more rooms!
