"Escape room ""Kidnapped"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-kidnapped,0,"We completed this room with approx 20-ish minutes on the clock. We are a group of 6 that have completed about 10-15 rooms. We do not think the difficulty rating on this one is appropriate. I would say it's medium difficulty, bordering on easy.It was unique to be split up with your group. It was a fun room and concept even though we felt like it was a little bit easy.Also, finding the spot is a little difficult. It's kind of hidden on the side of the road with a high rolling fence at the entrance to the parking lot."
"Escape room ""Kidnapped"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-kidnapped,1,This was really fun. You definitely need a diverse group of friends to do the wild west! It's a fun challenge and we has 12 minutes to spare!
"Escape room ""Kidnapped"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-kidnapped,2,"This our first experience with an escape room. Did it with two other couples on date night. Had a blast! We did the kidnapped room. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to escape from the room with nine minutes left, without any hints. Our wives were taken into a separate room and we had to rescue them and then continue all together. Don't want to give any too many details, but it was fun and challenging. The hardest part was that they didn't really tell us anything from the beginning. We just had to figure out what we needed to do. You get locked in a room with no instructions except to get out. A lot of fun, would totally recommend for groups of friends or team building activities for businesses. I was a little worried that you would have to be a genius puzzle solver. The puzzles/riddles/challenges were clever, but solvable. Thanks for a great evening PanIQ Room staff!"

We had a blast! I actually thought we were running out of time any minute, but we finished with 12 minutes to spare! I highly recommend this to one and all, but most especially family."
"Escape room ""Kidnapped"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-kidnapped,5,We had a great time! There were four of us and each one participated in getting us out with 8 minutes to spare....whew! We did get some helpful hints from our walkie-talkie guide. We're anxious to go back and try to escape another room...makes you really think out of the box!!!Fun time!!!
"Escape room ""Kidnapped"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-kidnapped,6,It's so much fun! I went with 4 other friends and we had an absolute hoot. So much time and effort has gone into planning these rooms. We did the kidnapped room and got out with 8 minutes to spare. Chan and Jeff were so much fun and helped in whatever way they could. A few of us began dancing after escaping the first room and they commented on the walkie talkies that they enjoyed it. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Phoenix!
