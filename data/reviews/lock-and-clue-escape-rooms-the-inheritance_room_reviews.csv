"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-inheritance,0,"This place is really awesome! My friends and I went here for our first escape room. We did the Inheritance room and unfortunately we didn't quite make it but it was a lot of fun. The staff was really nice, we also liked how they had actors who made the experience more enjoyable. After our time was up the actor came in and helped us get through the rest of the room and gave us some tips for the next time we go to an escape room. I would highly recommend and will definitely go back for the rest of the rooms. Just make sure you look on their website on where they are located since there isn't a sign on the outside, it can be a bit confusing to find."

I celebrated my birthday there last year, with the inheritance. I thought it would be one room to escape,  but it is multiple! The time they took into making these rooms is unbelievable.  I can't wait to go again!"
