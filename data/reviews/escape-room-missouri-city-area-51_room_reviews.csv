"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Escape Room Missouri City in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-room-missouri-city-area-51,1,We went here with some friends and ended up in a group of seven people. We tried the Area 51 room. We finished in 53 minutes and didn't need to use our extra five minutes. Time definitely flies and it was a lot of fun. We will definitely be doing it again and probably taking our kids.
