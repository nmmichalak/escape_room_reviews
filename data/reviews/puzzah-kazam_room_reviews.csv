"Escape room ""Kazam!"" by Puzzah! in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/puzzah-kazam,0,We disarmed the bomb with 1 1/2 minutes left. Phew...... We had so much fun. Great interactions with clues and listening clues. The room was decorated nicely and easy to manuver in. The employees were very very nice and seemed like they were having a great time too. We can't wait for the next theme to come out. We will be back and am telling friends. What a fun time for all ages.

The look of the room is fantastic and the technology used in the room is clever and sophisticated. For those with steady hands, I recommend the Heist. You'll need them to solve the puzzles to grab the priceless coin."
