"Escape room ""The Sword of Hattori Hanzo"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-the-sword-of-hattori-hanzo,0,"Myself and 4 other adults just did Wanted: Dead or Alive at the Del Amo site tonight and my husband and I with our 3 teens did The Sword of Hattori a month ago and had a blast. Tonight was my 5th escape room and I have to say the rooms at Back in Time have been my favorite, having so many details and clever surprises. I like that escape rooms are such a great bonding activity that allow us to think together through and talk about what happened after over dinner. My favorite room so far is The Sword of Hattori Hanzo. I'm looking forward to the next birthday or special event as an excuse to go to another room at Back in Time!"
"Escape room ""The Sword of Hattori Hanzo"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-the-sword-of-hattori-hanzo,1,"We had such an amazing time at Back in Time Escape Rooms.  First off, I didn't know there was an escape room in the South Bay!  So, in planning for a fun activity for our group, I was able to find this place so close to work.  We had an amazing time!  We did the room where we had to find the sword.  That room was challenging but fun!  Our group loved it.  We were sooooooo close, that we even got bonus time!  Sadly, we still didn't get out.  In any case, it really brought our team together, and we are looking to come back soon to experience Area 51 =)"

The games were fun, the party room was great and the staff was fantastic! For this age group, I would suggest the Witches of Salem, though they really enjoyed ""the Sword of Hattori Hanzo"" very much as well, they just needed a bit more time to complete it.  We will soon be back to try the ""Inside Area 51"".  Did I already mention the staff? :)  They were amazing, friendly, caring and on top of everything.  I highly recommend it!"
