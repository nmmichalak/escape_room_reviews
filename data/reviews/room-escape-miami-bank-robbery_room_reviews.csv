"Escape room ""Bank Robbery"" by Room Escape Miami by Fox in a Box in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/room-escape-miami-bank-robbery,0,Absolutely love coming here. I have completed the Prison Escape and Bank Robbery. It is super fun and a great way to bond with your friends and family.  Groups of 4 or more would be ideal. It's also great to disconnect from the world for the hour and focus on the game. The key to success for this is communication. Everyone needs to work together! Highly highly recommend. So much fun!

We did the bank robbery and managed to get it done with only 1 minute and 21 seconds to spare. I would definitely recommend this place. So much fun and our guide was amazing! Teamwork is key!!!

"Escape room ""Bank Robbery"" by Room Escape Miami by Fox in a Box in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/room-escape-miami-bank-robbery,2,Our firm did this as a team building opportunity. It was an amazing and fun thing to do. It was challenging but not over the top. I would recommend this for couples and families alike no with employers doing this for team building for employees. It's great for all ages! The staff was as amazing as the game! I would do it again in a heartbeat. Need one on the other coast of Florida!

Our Game supervisor, Lucas, was super nice and helpful! We chose the bank robery and finished it in 48min! Not too bad for a first time! :) Can't wait to try another room soon!"
