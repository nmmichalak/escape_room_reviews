"Escape room ""Sleeper Cell"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-insanity,0,We had an amazing time! We have a large team and they accommodated our team and fit us into the two escape rooms perfectly! Great team building exercise. We loved being “special agents” and trying to figure out the clues to escape on time. The group in the Insanity room loved every moment too. We can’t wait to go again and try opposite rooms. Thank you Nicki!
