"Escape room ""Narco"" by Escapology Lake Elsinore in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/escapology-lake-elsinore-narco,0,I went with a group of 6 people and we were all first timers. We were nervous because we accidently got one of the hardest rooms but the staff was very kind and helpful. The instructions are clear and it was very fun and entertaining. We worked as a team and enjoyed being challenged. Highly recommend!!!
