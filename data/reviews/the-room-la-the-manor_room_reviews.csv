"Escape room ""The Manor"" by The Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-room-la-the-manor,0,"Our group of 5 did The Manor a few weeks ago. It is a good mix of tech and traditional code/key locks. There are some reveals and elements that are reminiscent of the Haunted Mansion and The Munsters(for Boomers like me). Costumes(optional) are provided and add some comic relief and role playing aspects to this room. There are a few clues that are a little confusing, even after a hint. All in all, the three room here are definitely worth doing and are distinctively different experiences."
