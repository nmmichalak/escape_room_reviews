I have done two of their rooms: Jack the Ripper and Titanic. Both were so well thought out with the riddles, super thought out with the room design, and just so fun. Highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper - Solve the Mystery"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-jack-the-ripper,3,I booked the Jack the Ripper room the other day and took my son and daughter to celebrate his 25th birthday. We were joined by four other adults and had a blast solving this room. We were able to escape with 7 minutes to spare and were informed our group was the first ones to successfully escape this themed room. It was very well done and challenged us all. We will definitely be back to try other rooms. Thanks for the fun.
