The Hounds and Exodus were both amazing rooms. Haval, our game master was extremely friendly and demonstrated great customer service. The room design was immersive and definitely matched the themes."

However after my visit here for my younger sister's birthday, I'd love to come back here and try the even harder room, Masquerade. When we got there, we were greeted by Andrew who later explained us the rules after settling us into our room. My sister, six of her friends (13-14 years old), my boyfriend and I attempted the Exodus room. We were able to get out with 11 minutes to spare. It was all around fun for everyone."

We were in the Exodus room and would definitely go back to try the other rooms! Our host, Andrew, was super nice and friendly! I highly recommend him!"

The kids were spilt into two rooms, Exodus and Sherlock Holmes. They had to work together to figure out next steps, clues to be able to escape within an hour. It warmed my heart as a Youth Leader to see all the kids engaged and participating. There were a lot of giggles. The staff was top notch and made the kids feel very comfortable. I will be bringing my friends and family back for sure!!"
