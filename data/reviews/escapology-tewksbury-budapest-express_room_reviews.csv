First of all, the production value at this place was incredible. The lobby and even the space outside their front door is done up in decoration, and the room (we did Budapest Express) was super immersive. All of this added to the experience. We were able to solve the room but did need a few hints! I thought the puzzles were great, and it was fun to test our group's critical thinking and ability to work together. I will definitely return, and I highly recommend people check this place out!"
