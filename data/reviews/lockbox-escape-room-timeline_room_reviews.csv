"Escape room ""Timeline"" by Lockbox Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/lockbox-escape-room-timeline,0,We did Timeline and it was awesome. We had a group of 6 and there was enough going on in the room that everyone got to play their part. The staff was amazing! We have done quite a few escape rooms and this was definitely at the top of our list. We can't wait to go back. Such a fun time!

Took 7 friends and myself for my birthday (and first Escape Room), did both rooms, and everyone had a great time. The employees were very professional, the rooms were great, and I'd definitely recommend to everyone. Wish there were more rooms to do so I could do it again and again."

My husband and I did it for the first time and it was awesome. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We did the Timeline room and it was definitely full of surprises and the puzzles where definitely challenging. Can't wait to go again do the CIA room.
