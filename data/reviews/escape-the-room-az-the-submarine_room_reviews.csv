"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-az-the-submarine,0,So much fun to do. This was our second time here and it was as much if not more fun this time around. I highly recommend this place for a group of friends to do for a night out! Try the Submarine or the Agency. Both are awesome.

We had a blast while solving the riddles and working together. We managed to beat the clock with about 4 minutes to spare. I really enjoyed the challenging atmosphere and having the opportunity to work with my boyfriend's family in the tense situation. The employees at the Scottsdale location were incredibly friendly. They were professional and made our group feel comfortable too. I would highly recommend trying an Escape The Room experience to anyone. It is the perfect setting for team building, but also family bonding and plenty of laughs."
"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-az-the-submarine,2,Our first escape room experience was here. My husband and I did it to celebrate our 13th anniversary for something different to do. We were placed with a family of 4 that we didn't know but it was fine. We did the submarine room and it was so much fun! Definitely looking forward to trying other rooms at Escape the room AZ with a group of friends.
