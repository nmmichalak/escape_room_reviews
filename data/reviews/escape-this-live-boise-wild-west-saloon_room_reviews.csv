This was the first time any of us had done this and it was so much fun! Way more difficult than any of us expected, but such clever puzzles. The staff was amazing! When I pulled up it was in a town house type business complex but don't let that put you off --there is a big adventure waiting for you inside!"

So much fun and we completed with 7:37 to spare! We'll be back to do the other rooms!!

It was something fun to do with friends that was not the same old thing.  It was fun to challenge our minds.  Our 12 year old son had the most fun of all.
"Escape room ""Wild West Saloon"" by Escape This Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-this-live-boise-wild-west-saloon,5,My family has done both the pirate and western theme & both were really fun. My 11yr old couldn't stop talking about how fun the experience was! Management was easy to work with and responsive to questions/concerns. I wouldn't recommend taking kids younger than about 7 or 8 because they won't understand the clues.
