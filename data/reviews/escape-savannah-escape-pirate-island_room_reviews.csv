"Escape room ""Escape Pirate Island"" by Escape Savannah in Savannah",https://worldofescapes.com/savannah/quests/escape-savannah-escape-pirate-island,0,"Our group did the Pirates Room and had a great time. We had been in other escape rooms before, but this was the first one with an interactive staff (other than the faceless hints over an intercom). The staff interaction added a nice touch and made the escape much more enjoyable, especially for the children in the group.We would give Escape Savannah another go on our next visit to the city."

We really enjoyed the puzzles in the pirate escape room. They were uniquely different than the others we have been to. We made it out in less than 32 minutes without any hints or help from the pirates.

We worked together to figure out how to escape the room using a wide variety of clues (maps, keys, etc). Although there was a time constraint, we never felt rushed."
