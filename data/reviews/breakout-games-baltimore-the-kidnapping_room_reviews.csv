I was surprised how much fun it was and how fast it went. The Game Master was great, everyone just really helpful and nice. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun experience. We did the Kidnapping and needed a few clues to get it done. Weâ€™ll be back to try others."

Took my boyfriend for his bday on Feb 15th. We have never done an escape room before. The staff was really really nice and informative. We did the kidnapping room. I have anxiety issues so I was nervous about being blindfolded and handcuffed but I was a trooper and went along with it. That hour went by sooo fast and you get a rush from each code you crack. Unfortunately, we didn't escape on time. The staff member came in to show us what we didn't accomplish. A great experience."

It was a great time! The staff is amazing and lovely, friendly people. The facility was very clean and the room was nicely put together. My husband and I were paired with another pair of people that had booked the same slot for 'The Kidnapping'. We all worked together well and broke out with 8.5 minutes to spare! I would love to visit again sometime soon and bring some more friends along."

My boyfriend and I went as a two-man team to escape The Kidnapping. The clues were awesome and very well thought out. We had fun working together to solve each puzzle. We didn't get out in time but we were very close! We will definitely try this again!
