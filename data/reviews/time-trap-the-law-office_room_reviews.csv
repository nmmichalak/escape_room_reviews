"Escape room ""The Law Office"" by Time Trap in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/time-trap-the-law-office,0,"We did the Christmas edition of the Law room, it was amazing! The clues were fun & detailed, not too easy but also not too hard. Definitely will be back for another room! Also it was my birthday & we didn’t mention it but they figured we were celebrating something...so they gave us cupcakes! Seriously a great small business to support!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻"

As first timers we were unsure what to expect but the staff was Super helpful in preparing us on what we may encounter. Thanks Time Trap for a Great night! I would defiantly Recommend this not just for fun but also as a team building exercise.

My 14 year old was the best clue finder in the group! The owner was super friendly and helpful. We did the law office. Would definitely like to try out the other rooms and the RV. Fun for the whole family!
