"Escape room ""Welcome to the Afterverse"" by Totem Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/totem-escape-welcome-to-the-afterverse,0,Three adult children and I visited this escape room. We had been caught up in traffic and were a couple of minutes late and they were very nice to us. We had a great time and barely made it out of there in time.

We went with a group of 7 to ""Welcome to the Afterverse"" and love every minute of it. We escaped the room after solving a myriad of various puzzles and would love to do it again. Our game master was awesome and added so much to the experience!"
