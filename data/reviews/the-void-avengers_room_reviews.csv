"Escape room ""Avengers VR"" by The Void in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/the-void-avengers,2,"An absolutely amazing experience that is 100% worth the $30 price tag. I went with my buddy to the Avengers: Damage Control experience and was blown away. I went in assuming it would just be a room and things would happen, but physically having to navigate through rooms and other areas was totally unexpected. The staff was also great. Shout out to David for really providing an immersive and themed experience for us. I will definitely be returning for other experiences!"
