We had a blast! Awesome staff, immersive design, and puzzles that really make you think. We escaped from Room 1306; can you?"

Room 1306 was very well put together, the puzzles made sense, and I had a great time escaping. The props and decor where great as well. I can’t wait to go back when they open their next room, Sanctuary."
"Escape room ""Room 1306"" by Uptown Escapes in Shelby",https://worldofescapes.com/shelby/quests/uptown-escapes-room-1306,2,I can’t wait to go back! We did an escape room in Gastonia once before this one blew it out of the water. From the very beginning this is so much fun. The people who run it are so friendly and funny. It was so much fun. Well worth 25 per person!! We did room 1306 and I’m ready to go back and do the next room!
