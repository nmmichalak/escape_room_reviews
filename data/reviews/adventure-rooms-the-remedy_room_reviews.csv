"Escape room ""Remedy... 25 Years Later"" by Adventure Rooms in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/adventure-rooms-the-remedy,1,My boyfriend and I booked the Remedy room and it was so much fun! We haven't done anything like this before. We highly recommend it. The puzzles were challenging yet rewarding. We will definitely be back.
"Escape room ""Remedy... 25 Years Later"" by Adventure Rooms in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/adventure-rooms-the-remedy,2,A group of 8 of us booked The Remedy for last night. Two of us had done an adventure room in Arizona (totally different) but the rest of us had no idea what to expect. We had a great time and worked (surprisingly) really well together - it was clear that each of us had different talents that could be utilized and everyone was in the right frame of mind to get into the challenge. We did the Adventure Room to kick off a birthday celebration weekend and it was a big hit. Would definitely recommend to others...we'll definitely go back to try the other room. And btw - we actually made it out (barely!) with seconds to spare!!!

The puzzles are challenging, innovative and fun. I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back and try additional rooms"

The staff was super nice and very informative while giving us the directions. If you're looking for a fun afternoon or night out, I strongly suggest doing the Adventure Rooms. We had a group of 4 (you can do larger), and you get to test your strengths and senses. We are already planning our next trip."
