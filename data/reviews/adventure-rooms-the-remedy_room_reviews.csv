"Escape room ""The Remedy"" by Adventure Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/Adventure-Rooms-The-Remedy,1,Awesome experience at the Adventure Rooms with a group of 15 people. They were super accommodating and had us go into two rooms. The experience itself is really cool as you work together to solve the puzzles in the room. Def would do it again and the price was also reasonable. Loved it!

The employee at the desk was so friendly, welcoming, polite, informative, and helpful during our first visit. We did the Remedy room, where we had to unlock secrets to discover why we were stuck in a room with a disease and we had to unlock different locks and puzzles/riddles to find the cure. The four of us really had an enjoyable time here and we plan on coming back for the other room."
