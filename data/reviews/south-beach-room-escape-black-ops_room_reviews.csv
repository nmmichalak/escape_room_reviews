"Escape room ""Black Ops"" by South Beach Room Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/south-beach-room-escape-black-ops,0,Loved it! We escaped the Black Ops room. GREAT activity to do on a rainy Miami afternoon. We had a group of 6 and everyone left buzzing about the experience. It's both challenging and fun and the staff was helpful and engaging. We hope to return before we leave the city!

Friendly staff, clean facility (entrance is on James not Lincoln). If you are struggling you can get hints. Challenging for adults and teens - we finished Black Ops with less than a minute to spare!"

I came here with a large group for a friend's birthday and South Beach Room Escape exceeded all expectations! I was designated as the team leader (woot woot) and was given a walkie talkie to ask for hints during our hour long mission. Our room coordinator was extremely helpful with giving clues and the room had a good mix of puzzles so that everyone in our group was able to contribute in some way. We succeeded in our mission of finding a vial in a war bunker in under an hour!Overall, South Beach Room Escape was awesome at being an escape room but also goes above and beyond in making sure that their customers are having a good time before and after their game. I would definitely come back here to try the other rooms and to enjoy a drink on the rooftop patio before the game again!"

We brought in food and set up our own little photo booth, and the ladies were so personable and professional!! The puzzles were challenging, and we split the group up and competed against each other for the fastest time! We had a great time- we would do it all over again and would highly recommend this place to friends/colleagues/etc. 5 stars isn't enough!!!!"

They were wonderful & accommodated our group of 45 people with ease! Sophia was awesome helping me coordinate lunch for our hungry assocoates. We talked about it all the way home & can't wait to go back! I would highly recommend them for an office party, birthday party, bridal party.. any kind of party or small group! Thanks again you guys were wonderful!"
