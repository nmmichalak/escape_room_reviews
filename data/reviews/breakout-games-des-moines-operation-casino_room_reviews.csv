"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-operation-casino,0,"Checked in last minute to complete the Casino Room with my 12 year old son on a Tuesday Night. Can't remember our hostess' name but she was very friendly, helpful, and nice. The room was tough, but that's the point :) We loved the challenge and we escaped in time!We are DEFINITELY coming back to complete the other rooms."
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Des Moines in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/breakout-games-des-moines-operation-casino,1,This is our second experience at a breakout room. We actually tried a different business in Des Moines but liked this experience much better. Did the Casino Room. Robert was our guide and did a great job. We had a wide age range and all had a great time. Highly recommend.

For group outings, team building experiences, birthday parties, etc. It's very fun and unique!I went for a team building experience and it was great to see everyone's different skills come out. Aaron was our game master and we broke out in 58:23 minutes just in time! We played the Casino room which was challenging yet fun! Math and creativity, along with the helpful hints from Aaron, definitely was the key to success!There are maybe 12 different rooms and they're building another currently. The staff is very kind and welcoming. I definitely recommend the Breakout for a fun escape room experience!"

Room was super fun and lots of props to set the mood, and all the clues were engaging but just hard enough! Our game runner was awesome, she gave us enough to keep us going in the right direction without giving too much away. One of the best escape places I've been to!"
