"Escape room ""Special Ops: Mysterious Market"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-game-orlando-special-ops,1,Great atmosphere and the crew working was very nice! The escape room we dod was Special Ops and it was a lot of fun. We were able to escape and used almost all of the hour to solve the incident which was a fair amount of time given the difficulty was an 8 out of 10. Looking forward to doing another escape room as this was a great time!

Went for fathers day 2019 for the special ops game and had a very good time. Employees were very helpful and good at giving those little hints to help keep the game moving when we got stalled.

We came to Orlando for vacation, and decided to take a detour away from the hordes of people in the amusement parks. We're big fans of escape rooms, so this wasn't our first experience, and I have to say this company has the best rooms. We've done all of them. Special Ops and Mission: Mars are my favorites."
