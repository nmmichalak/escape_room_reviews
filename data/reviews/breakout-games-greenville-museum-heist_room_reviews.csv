We had a great time and managed to escape for the 1st time. John was our game manager and did a terrific job. This was our 2nd time at Breakout and we’ll be back again to try another room!
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Greenville in Greenville",https://worldofescapes.com/greenville/quests/breakout-games-greenville-museum-heist,4,This was my first escape room experience and it was so much fun! We did the Museum Heist with 7 people (including 2 young teenagers). Everyone had fun and there were lots of puzzles to keep everyone busy. It was challenging enough for the grownups and not too challenging for the teens. Our game master was excellent. We finished with 17 minutes to spare. Can't wait to do another room.
