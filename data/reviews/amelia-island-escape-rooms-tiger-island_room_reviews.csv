"Escape room ""Tiger Island"" by Amelia Island Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/amelia-island-escape-rooms-tiger-island,0,My family of four really enjoyed this themed escape. We completed it in about 37 minutes. The puzzles were a bit challenging - an easy/medium challenge level room. A great time with an extremely nice staff! Highly recommend 10/10.

The staff is always super friendly and helpful. The puzzles are challenging, fun, and rewarding. Definitely reccomend this to anyone looking for an adventure!"

We liked “Unlock the 80s” so much we returned to do “Tiger Island.” Both we’re challenging and super fun. We escaped both times! Will definitely come do this again on our next trip to Amelia Island!"
