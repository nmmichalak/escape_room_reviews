They had puzzles that used things I have never see in other escape rooms and it ended up being very well done."

However, it's was so much fun!!! It's a lot more challenging than we realized it would be, but you get your moneys worth. We did the Museum Heist, and got suck a few times, but the game master drops hit to help you along. It's a lot to solve for only two people, so I would recommend you have at least five people in your group. Definitely coming back to do the other rooms."
