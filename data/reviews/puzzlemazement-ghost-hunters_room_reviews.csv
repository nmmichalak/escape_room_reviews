"Escape room ""Ghost Hunters"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-ghost-hunters,0,This was my family's first time doing an escape room.  The host couldn't have been much nicer.  He was friendly and inviting.  The ambiance was warm.  They have lockers so you can store your personal belongings while you are in the escape room.  Puzzle are fun.  Even the easier riddles/puzzles can be challenging when out under pressure.  You are given an hour to escape the room.  Definitely coming back to try the other themed rooms.

I've also been to many escape rooms but I think some of the escape rooms here have been my favorite. You definitely have to work fast and open minded. The only room we did not pass was a very new one, paranormal, which was too difficult. I would recommend them to have a beta testing period and have the prices of the room be even cheaper so they can figure out what works best for the room. Overall, my friend and I always have a blast here and feel accomplished after beating the rooms...which cannot be said for most other places! We are team #blackhat, remember it!"

Both were challenging but very fair. The puzzles sometimes require thinking out of the box but nothing too complicated. The games were slightly spooky but as they state, they are family friendly and their purpose is not to scare you so no jump scares or anything. The workers are extremely friendly and helpful.I would totally recommend this to anyone!"
