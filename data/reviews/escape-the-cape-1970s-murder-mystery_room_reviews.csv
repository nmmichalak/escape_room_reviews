"Escape room ""1970's Murder Mystery"" by Escape the Cape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-the-cape-1970s-murder-mystery,1,We had a great time. Got out of the 70s murder with 35 seconds to spare. A lot of fun and the staff was great.
"Escape room ""1970's Murder Mystery"" by Escape the Cape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-the-cape-1970s-murder-mystery,2,"I travelled back in time with friends Friday evening to solve a murder mystery.  Who knew Cape Coral had a time travel portal?!?  It's right off of Pine Island Road.  The experience was a groovy ""Blast From The Past"" and we had a great time.  I'm happy to report we identified the killer and solved this cold case from 1972.We were a group of five adult women.  No one in our group had experienced an escape room previously.  The room was clean and decorated nicely for the story/theme.  The puzzles were challenging but solvable.  The reservation process and interaction with the game master, Patrick, was great.  They offer you hints/nudges if you get stuck.  They genuinely want you to have a positive outcome, weather you experience the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat.In my opinion, you don't need any previous experience to enjoy this room.  Their rooms accommodate up to eight people but I felt our group size was perfect.  We had enough people to search for clues and solve puzzles without feeling crowded or that there were too many people trying to do the same thing.  I wouldn't suggest this for a date but a double-date might be a lot of fun.Tips and Suggestions:  Make sure you arrive early so you can get a briefing from the game master and take care of any business before your time begins.  It may seem obvious but USE THE BATHROOM before you go inside.  Once you leave the room, your game is over.Final Assessment:  Great group activity for friends and/or family.  We laughed, had some great ""a-ha"" moments and made some fun memories.  This was a nice change from a typical Friday evening activity. I'm looking forward to doing this again."
