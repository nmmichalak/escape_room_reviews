"Escape room ""Lost City"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-lost-city,0,"We have done 5 out of the 6 escape rooms at Escapology. We always have an excellent time. The staff is really friendly, and the rooms are fun, interesting, and detailed. This time we did one of the new rooms, Lost City. Lost City had a great combination of puzzles. One of the best escape rooms around! We'll be back soon."
"Escape room ""Lost City"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-lost-city,1,"I really enjoy escape rooms, and this place has some highly detailed ones. The 2 new rooms (Lost City and 7 Deadly Sins) have some more recent technology in the props as well. The rooms and puzzles are well put together, though sometimes there seems to be a bit of a jump in logic for how to go about translating clues into a solution. I've done all of the rooms here, and would come back if they change them or add more."
