"Escape room ""Hotel’s Secrets"" by Escape Zone Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/quest-shark-adventures-hotels-secrets,1,"We did the Hotel Escape Room with two friends. It was slightly intense and so much fun! We got out with only a few minutes left! We will definitely go back to this location to do the other 2 rooms. Great place and the employees were very courteous, informative, and patient. They really added to the experience."
"Escape room ""Hotel’s Secrets"" by Escape Zone Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/quest-shark-adventures-hotels-secrets,2,We had a real blast. This was our first experience working a physical escape room. We really enjoyed the level of sophistication as well as the team work required to escape the Hotel's Secrets. Thank you for a great experience!

We didn't know what to expect going in but after we did the Hotel escape room, all five of us were talking about how we were looking forward to doing another room real soon. The owners did a great job on the room puzzles. It was a great time with family and friends. Something different than just going out to the movies all the time. Thank you Quest employees and management."

This was perfect. It was reasonably priced and Nick, our host, was very nice! The first puzzle is finding their location, it's nestled in the back corner of a strip-mall/school, but definitely worth trying to figure it out!"
"Escape room ""Hotel’s Secrets"" by Escape Zone Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/quest-shark-adventures-hotels-secrets,5,"Were invited by our friend who is more experienced player. Was a first experience for us. The Russians at reception were very welcoming, they had their 2 adorable daughters there entertaining guests before the round. The game itself appeared to be quiet fun, especially once you understand how to look for the clues. We managed to finish the room (was called Hotel room or something) in 33 minutes which was very good for beginners we were told. Anyhow, seemed like great fun, something completely new, especially for the money it costs - peanuts comparing to other entertainments."
