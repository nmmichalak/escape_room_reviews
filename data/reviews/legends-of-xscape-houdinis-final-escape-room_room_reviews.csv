My friends and I (group of 5) went on a Friday afternoon and chose the Houdini room (level 9/10). Despite being a beginner, the room was a perfect balance of challenging and fun. Our game master was Savannah, and she was so sweet and assisted us as needed. 10/10 would come back, especially to try the Area 51 room."
