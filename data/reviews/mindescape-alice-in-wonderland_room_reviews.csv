"Escape room ""Alice in Wonderland"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-alice-in-wonderland,2,"I tried all three of their rooms and they are all incredible. Jack the reaper and the prison are both more classic escape rooms but the puzzles are original, with tons of great manipulating ideas and great decoration.The third one, Alice in Wonderland, is UNIQUE, goes way beyond anything I have seen in an escape room. Absolutely TERRIFIC"

They were very informative and playful, getting into character to make it more lively. The Wonderland room was difficult but not impossible for a group that's done about 3 or 4 rooms together. Would return for a different room for sure."
"Escape room ""Alice in Wonderland"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-alice-in-wonderland,4,"My family loves to do escape rooms together and our very first one was MindEscape's Thai prison, which continues to be our favorite. After trying many others rooms, we returned to MindEscape to try the Alice in Wonderland room. This room is more puzzle focused as opposed to finding physical clues, and is filled with challenging puzzles that require smart thinking, acute observation and all of your senses. We enjoyed it so much that we already booked our return date to try Jack the Ripper."
