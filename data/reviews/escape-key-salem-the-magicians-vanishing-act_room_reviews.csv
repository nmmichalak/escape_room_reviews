"Escape room ""The Magician's Vanishing Act"" by Escape Key in Roanoke",https://worldofescapes.com/roanoke/quests/escape-key-salem-the-magicians-vanishing-act,0,"""The Magician's Vanishing Act"" was our family's third experience with solving escape rooms. I think we all enjoyed this one the most of the ones we'd done. There was a lot of attention paid to having multiple puzzles that could be solved simultaneously, so that our team of 7 could break into smaller groups and tackle problems. There were a few neat surprises along the way, a few things that we got lucky on, and one stickler of a puzzle we struggled with for a while.. but eventually solved it successfully. It was a fun time, and we look forward to returning for their second room!"
"Escape room ""The Magician's Vanishing Act"" by Escape Key in Roanoke",https://worldofescapes.com/roanoke/quests/escape-key-salem-the-magicians-vanishing-act,1,"We took our six children (ages 6-13) to solve ""The Magician's Vanishing Act"" and had a wonderful experience! There were enough clever puzzles to keep my husband, myself, and our teens busy and challenged while also including plenty of engaging, hands-on ways for our youngers to feel helpful and involved. It was fun for our whole family and would definitely be great for escape room fans of any age. We found this to be the best room we've done so far and recommend it highly!"
