"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Escape Game Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/escape-game-knoxville-the-villains-lair,0,We had a group of 6 and there was plenty for each of us to figure out in the Villain Lair! Great location and the staff was phenomenal! It was a very challenging scenario but was well thought out!

None of us had ever done this before but it was so fun. Our 11-year-old and 15-year-old daughters had a blast! We definitely plan on going back. Amanda is super cool. She made sure we had a great time.

The staff was so enthusiastic about their job and make the game soo much better! The riddles are definitely mind boggling but are so much fun to figure out!

I worried it would be hard for them to do but they caught on (with some help from the hints!!) and we had a blast! Almost almost made it out! I can't wait to go back! This would also be a great thing to do with a work group or a church youth group as a team building activity!!!"
