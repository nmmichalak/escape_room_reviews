It was a beautifully mind-boggling time that promotes family togetherness and quick thinking. Although we did not escape, we learned to work as a team and use clues to get the job done. A great trip for anyone. Would most definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fun, challenging adventure."

The staff was great, attentive, and super friendly. We did 2 rooms, prison break and special ops. The prison break room was the most difficult(we didn't escape) and special ops was pretty difficult as well( we escaped!) Overall it was a great experience and I hope to be returning soon!"
