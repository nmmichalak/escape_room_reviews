"Escape room ""Alien Zoo"" by EscapeOut Folsom in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escapeout-folsom-alien-zoo,1,The kids are always excited when we do one of their escape rooms. The latest alien zoo was are favorite. We have even brought the grandparents along with another visit. Staff is fun and always in character. We have one last room to try and then we can say we have done them all. But have not successfully completed one. We can only hope one day we can manage our own way out.

We've done other escape rooms and the Alien Zoo at EscapeOut was SUCH a welcome surprise! The staff was outstanding - excellent characters, costumes, and interaction (I was a little creeped out, in a good way!), and the puzzles were so challenging, yet the entire experience was appropriate for kids as well. Can't wait to support this place again!"
