"Escape room ""Panacea"" by Room Escapers in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/room-escapers-panacea,0,I brought my daughter and friends for her 18th birthday. We had a phenomenal time! The Panacea room was a bit tough but was no match for these kids. They escaped the room! Our guide was awesome. She was so friendly and very encouraging. Everyone was so excited by the experience that they can't wait to go back. Thank you Room Escapers for a very memorable birthday!

We selected the ""Panacea"" ....and it did not disappoint. The RE staff on duty was excellent she was part of the equation that made it a fun night. Definitely will return to try the other rooms."

Great detail and puzzles were tough.  9 of us aged 13 -74, all contributed but we did get some clues from Super Jeff and we were successful.  We've been to 4 Escape rooms and two were with Room Escapers - we also loved the original Pirate Booty.  We are definitely looking forward to  trying Chaos and any new rooms that might come along.  Definitely recommend it and Jeff!"
