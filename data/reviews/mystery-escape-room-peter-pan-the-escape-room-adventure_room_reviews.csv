"Escape room ""Peter Pan The Escape Room Adventure"" by Mystery Escape Room in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/mystery-escape-room-peter-pan-the-escape-room-adventure,0,I was able to go with a group of friends. We had SO much fun! We did the Peter Pan escape room. It was a blast. We were able to escape and save Tinkerbell. Our guide was Captain Sparky and he did a great job. The room looked awesome. There were lots of cool elements. We had a great time. It was a good puzzle without being too hard. Thanks so much!

Family of 4 with Nearly (Melissa) as a guide. Story was cute, our guide was fun and interactive, room was well-made. First escape room for my son and my parents- everyone was able to work on the puzzles and get into the game!"
