"Escape room ""The Escape"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-the-escape,0,"This was such a cool and fun experience! More than I expected and really a great time for all of us. I will definitely be going back to try another room. We did The Escape this time, it was definitely challenging and had a great story line. So glad we picked The Unlockables for my first escape room experience, cant say enough how much fun I had!"
"Escape room ""The Escape"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-the-escape,1,"We had an amazing time in this escape room. The story is great, the decoration and the effort that they put to create a scary ambiant is amazing !We were 4 friends and we did it ! It wasn't easy but it was so much fun. The puzzles are amazing and very original. Maybe 1 or 2 things that are 'too much' but it would be the only details. We only can recommend you to go. Staff is very friendly !"
"Escape room ""The Escape"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-the-escape,2,So much fun. With group of 7 first timers ... This was such a great first room. We didn't make it in time but it was still so much fun!! They got us hooked for sure!!
"Escape room ""The Escape"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-the-escape,3,Went with my trusted group last week and really enjoyed the experience. There were a couple quirks/bugs but the GMs helped us through it. The first act of the game was quite unique (it's the second time we've seen it done in escape games). We passed and made leaderboard (yay!). We look forward to the future rooms from The Unlockables.
