"Escape room ""Saloon 66"" by Flagstaff Escape Space in Flagstaff",https://worldofescapes.com/flagstaff/quests/flagstaff-escape-space-saloon-66,0,"Went to the escape room on very little notice (we wanted to do something fun, yet none of us planned anything) after confirming they had availability. I'm so happy we went to this one. It was fun and detailed and different from any escape room I've been in before! We completed the Saloon Room, and I can say that it was difficult to make all of us think, but also just easy enough for us to get out with 7 minutes to spare. Please please go here! Book a room online or call ahead, the price is well worth the hour given to play and if I'm ever in Flagstaff again I'll be trying to hit this place up."
"Escape room ""Saloon 66"" by Flagstaff Escape Space in Flagstaff",https://worldofescapes.com/flagstaff/quests/flagstaff-escape-space-saloon-66,1,Our family LOVES Escape Rooms and we've done rooms in several different states and we really enjoyed this room! We booked last minute due to the weather changing our spring break plans and this was definitely a silver lining of that!! We did the Saloon 66 room it was challenging and fun we unfortunately didn't escape but we had a great time trying!! Would definitely recommend this company to anyone looking for Escape Rooms in Flagstaff!!
