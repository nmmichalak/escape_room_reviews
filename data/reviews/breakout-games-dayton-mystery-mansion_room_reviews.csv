We did the Mystery Mansion room, and made it through with five minutes to spare. Great atmosphere, engaging clues without being overly complicated, I look forward to doing the other rooms here.

"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-mystery-mansion,1,"Was a great experience all around. Appreciated that I was able to split my group into two equal sized groups of 7, instead of the 8 in one room and 6 in another, that I had booked. Courtney did an amazing job as a GM, and Mystery Mansion was well produced and original."
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-mystery-mansion,2,Great day! We did the Haunted Mansion and having done other escape rooms is various cities this one was by far more challenging. LOTS of detail and communication is key. But we had a great time even though we didnâ€™t escape in time.
