"Escape room ""Deathâ€™s Dimension"" by Quadra Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/quadra-escape-deaths-dimension,0,"Yesterday I attempted the Death's Dimension room. It was by far the best experience I've had in an escape room so far. It also helped that we managed to be the first team to escape this brand new room. The theme was great, the feedback mechanisms were fun, and the puzzles were innovative and more interactive than I'd seen before.The staff are super friendly and helpful, and the other games available have been good experiences as well, giving me and my group plenty of reasons to return for more fun challenges."
