"Escape room ""Vegas Hangover"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-vegas-hangover,1,Sooooooooooo much fun!! We brought our staff (group of 31) for team building and they were very accommodating! They opened early for us so we could get the groups through and we had a blast! The Hangover room was very well put together! We will definitely be back again!!!!! Thank you for a great time!!
"Escape room ""Vegas Hangover"" by Escape FLA in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-fla-vegas-hangover,2,"Super nice host, and what a challenge! and we did it! but barely. We got a few hints, the hints weren't too obvious, just enough to keep us going. One or two of the clues are super hard so don't be shy to get a hint! Cute ""hangover"" theme made us laugh a few times. Recommend!"
