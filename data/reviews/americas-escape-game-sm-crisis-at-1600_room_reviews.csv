"Escape room ""Crisis at 1600"" by America's Escape Game in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/americas-escape-game-sm-crisis-at-1600,0,"We had a blast doing the ""Crisis at 1600"" room. It is kid-friendly compared to some of the other rooms there. I've been to other escape rooms before, but this one was tougher. They allow you 3 hints during the hour and we needed them! Getting out with just over a minute to spare. Wasn't expecting it with 4 kids, but they all did a great job. Can't wait to go back!"

The game was very challenging. There were 8 of us, and it took all eight to finish the room in 50 minutes. We're DEFINITELY coming back to do those!!!"

Escape Artists Clarissa, Nadji, and Siggy were awesome! Crisis at 1600 was so much fun and definitely left me with a headache in a good way! I am moving out of state shortly but when I visit I will definitely be back!!! Thanks ladies!"
