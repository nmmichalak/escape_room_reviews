"Escape room ""Dr. K’s Lethal Injection"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-dr-ks-lethal-injection,2,We did Dr. K's Lethal Injection for our friend's birthday. It was my first ever escape room and I was excited but I never even imagined how much fun and how intense it would be. I thought it was also cute how they reviewed our highlights for us at the end. I can't wait to do their other rooms.
"Escape room ""Dr. K’s Lethal Injection"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-dr-ks-lethal-injection,3,We did Dr K's Lethal Injection this Saturday evening and it was so much fun. Went with five of my friends for our first escape room ever. I wasn't sure just what to expect but the entire thing was definitely well thought out. We laughed so much trying to find clues some of which were right in front of us and we don't notice it. The staff was very friendly and welcoming too. Can't wait to try the other 2 rooms now.
