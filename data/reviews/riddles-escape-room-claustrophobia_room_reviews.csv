"Escape room ""Claustrophobia"" by Riddles Escape Room in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/riddles-escape-room-claustrophobia,0,"We loved claustrophobia! It was a different kind of escape, in a closet size room and you only have 30 mins which was great for us. This was my favorite escape place because the staff is awesome!! Itâ€™s a very nice and trendy family owned business and everyone there is so nice. You will especially like Devin!"

This was our second escape room experience together (did one in Rehoboth Beach, MD) and her third overall (she also did one with her dad in Roanoke, VA) -- by far the best one yet. We finished, with four minutes to spare, and the staff, all of whom were really nice, gave us hints at appropriate times without taking away any of the challenge/fun or making us feel stupid.It was a great bonding experience and we will definitely go back the next time we return to Myrtle Beach."

The owners are some of the nicest people you will ever meet. We tried the ""Claustrophia"" room and had so much fun. Can't wait to return and try all of your other games!"
