"Escape room ""Orient Express"" by Architect Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/theme-quest-escape-rooms-orient-express,0,"	Back for the second time around and this time we did the Orient Express room! We escaped this room with 15 minutes left to spare. Although most of the puzzle are just basic locks and keys, this room uses some more higher tech puzzles than the Houdini room. With that being said I thought that the difficulty level was about same between both. There are lots of puzzles that keep you moving and thinking the entire time and there is never a dull moment. We did have to use our hints and the GM did a great job of pointing us in the right direction yet not blatantly giving us the answer, which I appreciate. 	I am also happy to report that the rooms now have countdowns them! Also the staff is still as amazing and friendly as they were last time. They do a great job explaining the rooms backstory, the rules, and ways to get help if you need it. This time we even got to see some magic tricks while we were waiting for our room. 	If you are looking for an escape room to do that is well themed and well priced, I highly recommend Theme Quest! Canâ€™t wait to go back for the Bonnie and Clyde room! "

We had just finished a room somewhere else that didn't quite fulfill our puzzle solving needs and found Theme Quest by chance. The room was full of fun, creative and interactive puzzles. I am very excited to try their other rooms. The hosts were friendly and Joseph, the magician, was awesome."

Did the Murder on Orient Express room. Super fun! People were super nice. While we waited we were entertained with magic tricks. Overall it was a great experience and the staff was great!"

We did the Orient Express room and we were definitely impressed by how much they managed to fit into this small room. We had just come off a room at a different company that was very spacious and had many rooms and lots of fancy technology, but we felt like solving the puzzles required too much guesswork and not enough logic. After that, this room was a total breath of fresh air. The staff was also super helpful and friendly. Magic tricks in the lobby was a fun bonus too! Definitely will be going back to try their other rooms. They also said they are expanding, which is great, because this place definitely has a lot of potential."
