The room was captivating intricate . Complety and totally maintain character and theme of the room.Seemed like they really enjoyed their jobs. I’d highly recommend this company and this room (Grand Zeppelin)!!If you do decide to go definitely bring a larger group. We manage to escape with two people . But the room was designed for 10 or more with lots of intricacies and mutilple layers"
