"Escape room ""Mission: Reactor"" by Shipwrecked in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/shipwrecked-mission-reactor,0,"We've done a handful of escape rooms in a bunch of different cities. The Shipwrecked rooms are really well done. They are only 25 minutes long, but that worked really well for us. We were 3 pre-teens and one adult. The puzzles were great, and some of the best built rooms we've seen so far. We did two rooms in one day. We'll come back for the 3rd, but hope they build more soon! :)"

Now they just opened miniature escape rooms. We did one today and it was fantastic!!! Highly recommend Shipwreck for any age!! Beautiful environment and accommodating staff!! My son and I were one of their first customers. I honestly can’t count how many times we have been there in total. Yes, it’s that great!!"
