We were able to escape with 1 minute and change left. It was very challenging. It was a true group effort! This is one of the hardest and best ones we have done so far. I would recommend this room anytime!
"Escape room ""Molly’s Horror Room"" by Room Escape DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/room-escape-dc-mollys-horror-room,4,"A friend and I decided to do this last minute, and so we were paired with two random people. It turns out that it was the best experience! The fact that we didn't know each other was irrelevant because we were able to escape with seven minutes left. Molly's Horror Room was definitely a challenge and may not be suitable for younger children as it has a few jump scares. Ovi was our game master and was great with setting us up and providing us with gentle nudges when we weren't quite on the right track. Overall, I would definitely do it again!"
