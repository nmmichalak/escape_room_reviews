"Escape room ""Crisis at 1600"" by America's Escape Game in Oxford (MS)",https://worldofescapes.com/oxford-ms/quests/americas-escape-game-oxford-crisis-at-1600,0,Crisis at 1600 was awesome. Would definitely go back with a bigger group! Difficult for 2 people and a 19-month-old. Davis was the perfect room moderator.
