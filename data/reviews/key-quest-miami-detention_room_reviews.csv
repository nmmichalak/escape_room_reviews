"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/key-quest-miami-detention,0,"Nice place, good stuff and really competitive prices. Thinking outside the box is definitely needed. We've visited Detention and Vacation Vandals. The area of the games is rather small and the interiors could be more sophisticated. Anyway, I recommend Key Quest escape rooms. Creative and logical riddles and interesting plots can be found there. Gifts for winners have been a nice surprise for us. :) Also, we've enjoyed laser games."
