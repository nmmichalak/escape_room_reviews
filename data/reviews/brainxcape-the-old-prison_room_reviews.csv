"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,0,"I am an alumni of probably 30 rooms by now in several countries, and this one is not among the good ones on my list. A good puzzle should be challenging, because it requires creativity, intelligence, etc. A bad puzzle is a puzzle you know how to solve early on, but waste a lot of time due to technicalities, reliance on luck, or ill-execution. This room had one or two good puzzles and too many bad ones in my view. I agree with other reviews that the set is well executed, but I'm afraid it is not enough."
"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,1,Did the Prison escape with a group of four. They let us go over by seven minutes to finish because we’re so close even though we had technically failed. So grateful they let us finish. It was amazing. Worth every penny. Can’t wait to try another!

"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,3,Did the Prison room yesterday for my daughter's birthday. We've been to quite a few escape rooms and this was hands down our very favorite. The set was amazing and suspenseful. The puzzles were challenging and the hints were just enough without totally giving it away. We escaped with 90 seconds to spare. We can't wait to come back to do the haunted hotel!
"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,4,"Prison Break was an excellent experience and very well executed. Even as we entered the building up to the room, there was a great creep-factor and atmosphere. It would've been extremely difficult if it weren't for my 6 friends' minds simultaneously working together and thinking in different ways, as we had some moments where we felt stumped. Great for groups of 5 or more and anyone that loves pressure, puzzles, and digging around for clues."
"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,5,"This was my first escape room experience and absolutely loved it! My group chose the prison room and I felt completely absorbed in the atmosphere…the set was well executed, such incredible attention to detail. I wanted it to keep going and going…I wanted to explore more rooms! Seriously a great challenge, it kicked our asses in the best way :D I would love to go back and try the other room and would definitely recommend this to others. Overall great experience, A+!!!"
"Escape room ""Rikers, 1932"" by BrainXcape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/brainxcape-the-old-prison,6,"Me and my team were some of the first people to ever experience BrainXcape! We really didn't know what to expect. We knew we were in for it when we pushed the intercom on the buildings sidewalk...We heard a deep voice direct us to enter... and a few minutes later were locked in a cold, concrete cell. The atmosphere, the sound, the lighting was all perfect. It was incredibly well done and immersive. Most escape rooms don't pay any attention to the feelings, anxiety, or detail of the scenery..Brainxcape however clearly wanted their audience not only to feel the stress of the clock but the stress of the environment. My team scrambled for the clues and made it so close to the end... (don't want to give away surprise!) "
