"Escape room ""The Box"" by Amazing Escapes of Boise in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/amazing-escapes-of-boise-the-box,2,"I've had the opportunity to play through  ""The Box"", and I gotta say... I've been to escape rooms when I lived in California, and they just don't stack up to the amount of Love and care that was put into these rooms.

Hands down."
