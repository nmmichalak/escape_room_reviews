"Escape room ""Mine Trap"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-mine-trap,1,"We had a company outing at Escape Tactic and had a great time in the Amazon Survival and Mine Trap rooms. Both teams made it out, but it wasn't easy! They are a new facility but they put a lot into the environment of the rooms which we appreciated. Would recommend for other companies looking for a fun team-building activity!"
