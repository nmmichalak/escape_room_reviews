"Escape room ""Becoming Houdini"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-becoming-houdini,0,We spent the evening escaping from the Houdini room! My team of seven were warmly welcomed to a clean and friendly lobby. Our game master Janey was fun and professional! When we beat the room record she was excited with us. The overall experience was awesome! The room itself was a 9/10 difficulty and it was pretty complex. Weâ€™re fairly experienced escapists and this room was truly difficult. I totally recommend Puzzling Escape!
