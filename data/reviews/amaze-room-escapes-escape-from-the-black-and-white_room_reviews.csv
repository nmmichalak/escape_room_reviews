"Escape room ""Escape from the Black and White"" by Amaze Room Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/amaze-room-escapes-escape-from-the-black-and-white,0,"I highly recommend the Black and White room for a group of 4 adults (friends or couples). Our group of 4 (2 couples) had a great time doing that room, and it was a fun, pretty affordable experience for a double date night. FYI for other visitors - the Black and White room is quite difficult, definitely more than we anticipated, but it's still fun! We will return! (:"

"Escape room ""Escape from the Black and White"" by Amaze Room Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/amaze-room-escapes-escape-from-the-black-and-white,2,"Experience: Fiancee and I have done 30+ escape rooms all over the world and this is our third in the Triangle area.We did the black and white room. Booked with just two people and no one else booked with us. The size was perfect for two people - Having 4 people in here would have sucked and really brought the entire experience down (it's a relatively small room). Well-decorated, with several different contraptions I haven't seen before. Few lock/key puzzles which is a huge bonus to me. It was a very linear room (they're upfront about this). We managed to escape with 5 minutes to spare, but I can imagine people who are somewhat new to escape rooms would have trouble on a few of these puzzles.In summary, it's not the best room I've ever done, but it's hard to find two person rooms and this is definitely one of the better ones."
