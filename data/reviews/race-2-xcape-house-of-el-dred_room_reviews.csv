"Escape room ""House of El'Dred"" by Race 2 Xcape in Springfield (MO)",https://worldofescapes.com/springfield-mo/quests/race-2-xcape-house-of-el-dred,1,I have been to Race 2 Xcape twice to do escape rooms and both times were so much fun. House of El Dred was my favorite. I'm definitely coming back to do more escape rooms. Thanks Race 2 Xcape for the awesome time!
