"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-mystery-mansion,0,The first room was quite the challenge but after the first room it just kept getting better and better. I donâ€™t want to give it away but one of the tasks reveals something very cool. It was a little bit of a shock. It was a very fun room
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-mystery-mansion,1,I love doing escape rooms at Breakout! The employees are always friendly and every room has been a blast. Each room has fun and unique puzzles and Mystery Mansion and Do Not Disturb have stood out as clear favorites for the fun ways you need to figure out the clues. I look forward to playing again and can't wait for new rooms.

We loved this room. It had very high production values and there were several puzzles that were unlike anything I've ever seen before in an escape room.The staff will give hints whenever you ask for them (no walkie-talkies involved--the gamemasters just monitor you and speak to you through overhead speakers) We only asked for a few hints, but they were great ones: it was obvious the staff was paying close attention to what we were doing and saying at all times, so they only gave us as much information as we needed to start thinking in the right direction."

We did the Mystery Mansion room, which was really cool. I can't give away all the details, but from ages 7-45, there was something for everyone in our group to do. We broke out. LOVED IT!"

Our group of 7 had an amazing experience! The place was nice, bathroom was very clean. The employees were a lot of fun and you can tell they love their jobs. I've been to other escape rooms and Breakout was just perfect. All in all, we will definitely be going back!!"
