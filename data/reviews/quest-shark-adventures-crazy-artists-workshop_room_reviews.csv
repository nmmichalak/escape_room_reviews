It's not as big as some of the other rooms I've done or as well-furnished, but it has quite a bit of sophisticated lock mechanisms and puzzles that require some deeper level thinking which more than makes up for the size. Definitely recommend checking this one out on your rotation of Houston escape rooms!"

If you enjoy hunts, puzzles and mysteries, you'll love it."
