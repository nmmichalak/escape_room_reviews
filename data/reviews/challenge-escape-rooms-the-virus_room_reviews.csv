"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-the-virus,0,"We did the Virus room with ten people, most of whom had done an escape room before. We did not have a problem solving the puzzles and got out with over 35 minutes to spare.We had a good time, but the room was too short, we found. We were always moving forward, and did not get stuck for very long on any of the puzzles. There were a variety of locks and a variety of puzzles, none of which were particularly challenging."

My family and I did the The Virus along with two strangers, and we escaped with 12 minutes to spare. The theming was good (I especially liked entering blindfolded), and the puzzles weren't too difficult. It's not one of the best ever, but it's definitely a lot of fun."

Would recommend to any group looking to try something new. As a suggestion, they should at least tell you where to start so you don't end up skipping steps. Could get confusing."
"Escape room ""The Virus"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-the-virus,3,I went with a group of 10 of my friends and did the Virus. It was so exciting and thrilling trying to figure out how the hell to get out. The surprises just keep coming along as you figure out each task. The best part was accomplishing and solving the puzzle! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves a challenge.

We had a great time. I highly recommend trying it...we got so close but we're unsuccessful but it was the greatest time ever though. Would love to go again!"
