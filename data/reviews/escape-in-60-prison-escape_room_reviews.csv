We were so close to escaping the prison, were on the last clue when time ran out. It was so much fun, we decided to come back to do another room an hour later!"

Even after receiving directions I was a little unsure. However, with 8 people in the room, we shortly started to make sense of the clues. Overall it was a nice activity to do with friends. And we did escape!"

The staff was very kind and helpful. It's in a very convenient location. We did the ""Prison Break"" room and found it very challenging although it's for all audiences. I look forward to returning to the adult room for an extra challenge. Highly recommend this place!"
