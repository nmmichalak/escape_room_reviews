"Escape room ""Judgment Day"" by Escape Room Kansas City in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/escape-room-kansas-city-judgment-day,0,"My Scholar’s Bowl team and I entered this room and none of the clues worked. All the technology in the room didn’t work regardless of how many times we tried. After trying the puzzles multiple times, we got frustrated and used the walkie talkie to contact the game master. However, the game master said that all our solutions to the clues were correct. She then had to manually enter a command to unlock the next portion. You’d think after spending $30 a person our room would actually work. This happened at least four times with four different puzzles. It was especially frustrating because we were so close to succeeding, and I know that if we had not wasted 1/4 of our time trying to get the game to actually work we would have escaped. "
