"Escape room ""The Mobster's Speakeasy"" by Time Trapped Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/time-trapped-escape-room-the-mobsters-speakeasy,0,"Enjoyed this smaller place a lot! The 20s themed gangster speakeasy set was fun, and perfect for 2-4 people. Each problem was engaging and the quality of the room was very good. Good choice for a date; not the right choice for a bigger group."

We had a team of 5 people and we achieved the 'escape' in about 46 minutes! What a sense of accomplishment! We can't wait to return to future themes with this great escape room business!
