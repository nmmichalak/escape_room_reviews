"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Room 5280 in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-room-5280-the-heist,0,"My group loved it!! As escape room junkies, finding out there was a location opening up in downtown Raleigh was a dream. Honestly the location can't be beat. It's near our favorite cupcake shoppe right across the street. Our group did the Heist and even though there was 3 of us (you physically need 4 or just 3 if you have tall people in your group) we successfully escaped. We've seen a lot of escape rooms in our day and there were puzzles that we have never seen before at all. The puzzles were very creative yet straight to the point. They were challenging and pertained to the theme of the room. Even though it was a single room, we weren't disappointed with that fact. There was enough to do and it was streamlined enough to work on them together rather than one person heading a group. There was also enough space for use to breath rather than feeling cramped in a one room escape at other locations. For an escape room that opened recently, it was polished enough and didn't have many errors at all. We can't wait to come back and try the different rooms to challenge ourselves even more!"

It was a good challenge and it made us work together to solve the puzzles. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. It was a lot of fun and we will all be back soon!"

I have visited Room 5280 twice with the same group and with each visit we cannot wait to return.  Excellent customer service, engaging games and an overall great time!  The Heist and the Experiment are the games we tried and we are counting the days until we are able to try the others!"
