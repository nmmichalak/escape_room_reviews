"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Escape the Room Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-the-room-indy-the-agency,0,"We just did The Agency with a couple of our friends (there were 4 of us total) and we had so much fun! The employee gave us clues at good times and we really enjoyed the theme. We were on the last clue when the time ran out, so we didn't win, but still had a ton of fun doing it! We will be back to do another room!"

Interesting, challenging puzzles, friendly, helpful (but not too helpful) staff. We beat the room with 43 seconds left on the clock. Exciting stuff!"

We did the Agency and NO, we didn't get out, but it won't keep us from going back and trying again! I have to say it is a bit too expensive for us to do very often, but we would and will when we can. Thank you for making it a fun day for us!"
