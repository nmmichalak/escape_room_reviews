There were 6 of us and we had a great time. We loved our host, Kiersten, who stayed in character the entire time, even when gIving us clues. She knew how to help us have fun!! Everyone there was very nice and friendly. We will go back to do the “Murder Mystery” room next. There are also other rooms that we want to do. Loved and recommend this place for fun!"
