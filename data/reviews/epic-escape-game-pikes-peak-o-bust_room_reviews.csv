"Escape room ""Pikes Peak or Bust: Colorado’s Gold Rush"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-pikes-peak-o-bust,1,We had such a wonderful time and can't wait to go again. This is a great activity for families
"Escape room ""Pikes Peak or Bust: Colorado’s Gold Rush"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-pikes-peak-o-bust,2,"So much fun!!! Staff was very friendly, and offered to accommodate our group of 9 last minute (8 is the usual max), suggesting we do Dorm of the Dead. All of us were escape room ""virgins"" but we had a great time, even though we didn't quite find the zombie antidote in time! (This is apparently their 2nd most difficult room.) I would definitely go back! It's such a cool concept, and they do a great job making it fun and challenging! They even helped us work through the last couple clues after out time ran out. I highly recommend you get your friends, family, coworkers, whoever together ASAP and try an Epic Escape Game!"

We went for a friends birthday. We did one of the ""easier"" rooms and it was a blast! The price was fair, the employees were awesome, and the puzzles fun. DO THIS! you will enjoy it!"

The puzzles are very clever and everyone is completely involved. As you solve one puzzle, you'll find yourself racing to the next, your pace increasing with each success as the clock relentlessly marches to zero. The pressure is intensely fun! Like others, we enjoyed it so much we did it two more times that week! BTW, we tried Puzzah, and Epic is much better. The rooms are tiny at Puzzah."
