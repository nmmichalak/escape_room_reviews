"Escape room ""Wizards and Spells"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-wizards-and-spells,2,Brought my son and his friends for his 15th birthday party today to the wizards & spells room. They loved it and had a great time. They really had to work together to get through the puzzles and they did it with 11 minutes to spare! Fun props and very Harry Potter like. Highly recommend for all ages.
