Kaz, the zombie, was the best part. He made the event hilariously funny and just an overall blast! I really enjoyed the taunting and the jesting that Kaz did with us. I laughed the entire hour. Danielle was a great host as well. She was supportive and very helpful. We would've died without her help. If you want to have a great time this is your event. If you want to solve puzzles that are tricky, then this is the place for that too. I would highly recommend this event!! I will definitely book another event with Kaz and Danielle!"
