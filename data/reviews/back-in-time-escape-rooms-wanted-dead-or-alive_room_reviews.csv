"Escape room ""Wanted: Dead or Alive?"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-wanted-dead-or-alive,0,"My group of four decided to do the Wanted: Dead or Alive, the western theme.  The difficulty is listed as a medium, and we barely escaped! Our game master was really patient with us and we enjoyed the game a lot.  I've done 50+ rooms and the quality in the room is there!  My friends and I will continue to do more of your rooms."

It is rated beginner- medium, but I found it pretty difficult even though we did escape with 8 minutes to spare using 2 clues. We had a team of 5 adults and we had a blast.  We totally recommend it :)"
