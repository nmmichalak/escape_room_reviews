The owner, Thor (yeah, like the dude with super hammer and the sexy abs) was super friendly. The Water Wall room was challenging and the puzzles were designed around the theme. I can't wait to try out their other rooms!"

Some missteps by the employees led to some misunderstandings, but overall we had a fun and authentic experience! Would definitely go again and try the other rooms as well!"

Waterwall was one of the better we have played. Excellent story and design. Next time we visit the lake we'll try another room.
