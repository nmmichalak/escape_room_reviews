We underestimated the experience and it turned out to be great. The actor was great and the escape room was definitely challenging. We achieved it with 2 seconds left. Will definitely do this again."
"Escape room ""Crime Scene"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-crime-scene,5,"After hearing about escape rooms from a fellow co-worker I decided to get a few friends together to try one out! I looked around online and eventually came upon Enigma and after looking at all of the reviews we went and booked the Secret Temple. The website was really simple to navigate and we received a confirmation email with all of the details we needed. Once we arrived at the building, we were greeted by our host with a friendly smile and really hyped us up for what was about to come. After all of the rules and backstory, we were then led to our room. The room had a bit of a National Treasure feel and there was a lot of character to the room. The puzzles were well thought out and it really made us rack our brains trying to get everything solved. We did have to use our two hints to escape but the whole adventure was just a great experience all together and we escape with only a minute to spare. We are looking forward to coming back and trying another room in the near future here."

I just got out of Apt. 205 with 2 other friends at Enigma Escape Rooms, and I have to say Bravo! I haven't seen my college friends in a while because we've all been busy with work and never seem to catch some time to hang out. Today we all happen to have a few hours to kill, so we called up Enigma because we've been dying to try it out. Not only was the staff incredibly friendly, but there was also parking (which is a huge plus)!We got there, they greeted us at the top of the stairs very nicely, we were told a little of what to expect, then we waited about 30 seconds and someone came out, and we got started. The storyline is awesome! The actor there was so committed it made our experience so much better! The puzzles were challenging, the adrenaline was pumping, and my friends and I had a killer time! Totally worth the time and money! I can't wait to go back and do The Will!"
