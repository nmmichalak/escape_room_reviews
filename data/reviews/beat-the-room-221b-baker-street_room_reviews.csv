We chose the Sherlock Holmes theme. We were greeted by the manager, who was super cool. Overall our whole experience was so much fun. Definitely will be back and bringing along some friends and family!"
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,1,Did the Sherlock room and it was amazing. Fun time trying to solve all the puzzles. Super tough room with fun twists throughout. This is my 3rd Escape the room and these puzzles were harder than the other 3. The staff was very friendly and patient with us. That's even with us coming at 10am in the morning.

We will definitely be back. It was so much fun!"

When we called to book a room, the staff was very friendly & accommodating. The ambience & decor were great, and the puzzles were creative yet challenging. We did the 221B room and enjoyed the twist (solving a crime instead of actually escaping the room) I would highly recommend coming here!"
