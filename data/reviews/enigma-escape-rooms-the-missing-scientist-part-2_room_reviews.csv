"Escape room ""The Missing Scientist: Part II"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-missing-scientist-part-2,0,Great idea for this escape room. It was extremely challenging but tons of fun regardless. Everyone was super helpful before and throughout our time spent in the room. I would definitely come back here again!
"Escape room ""The Missing Scientist: Part II"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-missing-scientist-part-2,1,We have gone multiple times and it makes an exciting and enjoyable date night. Took us two times to beat part 2 and the man who works there was rooting for us. I highly recommend this facility. The puzzles are hard but engaging and you will leave feeling very proud of yourself if you do escape.

Super fun team building activity! I was somewhat surprised by how good some of my team members were at some of the puzzles (not that they were good, but who was good at what) and it was awesome for all of us to shine in our own way!"
