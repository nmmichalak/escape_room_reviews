This place is by far the highest technology and cleanest room I have ran; I have been to other local rooms in Reno, Tahoe, and Sacramento. They even added fun little ""things"" that happened during the room. I highly look forward to running all of their other rooms!!! Jass was also super friendly and amazing to work with."
"Escape room "" The Asylum"" by Puzzle Room Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/puzzle-room-reno-the-asylum,3,Just got finished with Asylum and it was very well done. Lots of technologically cool puzzles that made it really exciting. I've done around 15 different escape rooms and this one is probably my favorite. You really got pulled into the atmosphere and felt like a prisoner on a mission to escape. You won't be disappointed. We escaped with 56 seconds left.

I brought my daughter & her two besties all the way from Sacramento to experience The Asylum for her 14th Birthday, and it was well worth it! It had the perfect level of creepy thrill and challenge. The facility is clean & modern, and the staff was very helpful and attentive to us. The owner is also very personable & friendly. We would like to come back to visit the other rooms!"
