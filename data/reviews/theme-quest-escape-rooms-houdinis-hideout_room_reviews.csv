"Escape room ""Houdini’s Hideout"" by Architect Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/theme-quest-escape-rooms-houdinis-hideout,0,"Did the Houdini Room (the smallest and most challenging room) and escaped with 1 minute left! It's a fairly low tech room (mostly just spin locks, and keys). The hint system was through walkie talkie and the GM was very attentive and helpful when we were stuck on some of the puzzles. There are no red herrings in this room, which is very useful so that you don't get stuck on something that isn't part of the game. Only negative thing is that there is no countdown in the room so you either have to ask, or just remember the time you started and time yourself on the clock. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We ended up parking outside in the metered parking. I believe it was $1.50 for 1 hour. We will be back for the other 2 rooms."

Very challenging but not totally frustrating - kept having successes along the way. Very clever!  We'll be coming back next time we are in the area, for sure! Thanks, Jon!"

Even though it's their smallest room, it was super challenging. We are escape room veterans by now and we had to use all of our 3 hints, but we did escape with about 7 minutes to spare. I love that nothing in these rooms feels like a huge leap. Even when you get stuck and get a clue, you immediately go ""Oh! How did I not get that?!"" It's also great that in a small room, they have multiple things you can be solving or working on at once so that everyone is always occupied. And this time we got magic tricks AND we got to play with a dog in the lobby. Seriously, the staff here is the best. Definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back and do Bonnie and Clyde!"

This was our first time trying an escape room and this one just recently opened up fairly close by. The staff was amazing, very fun and informative. We tried out the Houdini room and beat it with seconds to spare. Overall it was a great experience and I'll definitely be going back to tackle the rest of the rooms they have available!"
