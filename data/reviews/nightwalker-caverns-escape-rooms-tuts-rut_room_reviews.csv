"Escape room ""Tut’s Rut"" by Nightwalker Caverns Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/nightwalker-caverns-escape-rooms-tuts-rut,0,Amazing family run game! Our group had the best time and can't wait to return to play the other rooms!
"Escape room ""Tut’s Rut"" by Nightwalker Caverns Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/nightwalker-caverns-escape-rooms-tuts-rut,1,"I visited Tut's Rut with 5 of my friends. I've done a few other rooms, but nothing like this one. We put on our pith helmets and escaped the space ship into the tomb only to discover we had to keep going back into the space ship. All of the rooms work together, and you have to split your group into small teams and work on the puzzles, and just keep building on puzzles until the very end. We were overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere created by this room. It was incredible with Hollywood style special effects, but I don't want to give too much away. You feel like you're in a tomb!! After we escaped, we had to all hang around and check out the technology in this room. It's mind-blowing to see how this whole thing works together. My friend's birthday is coming up and I know where we'll be having his party!"
"Escape room ""Tut’s Rut"" by Nightwalker Caverns Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/nightwalker-caverns-escape-rooms-tuts-rut,2,It was a very good time. The room was very detailed and immersed you into the world. The father/daughter duo were very nice and helped a lot. It was tough but we did make it out within the hour and a half time period. Will be going back again.
