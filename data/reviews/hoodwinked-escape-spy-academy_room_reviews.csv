The Spy Room was very challenging, but we finished with 6 seconds to spare! The staff was professional and friendly.  We will definitely return and can't wait to try another room."

I personally have done two other escape rooms and in my opinion this was the best one so far, lots of genuine excitement as we moved through the room.  Most of the puzzles I had never seen before which is refreshing, some are quite novel - I did see 1 or 2 puzzles that were familiar. It was great working with another group as it provided a lot of varied perspectives on solving the puzzles. The staff is great and the lobby is cozy."

We tried our hand at the Spy Academy room. We were with 3 others, came close to escaping, but no cigar. I'll definitely return and try the other 3 rooms."

Unfortunately we got hoodwinked in the Spy Academy, but it didn't subtract from the fun! Staff was amazing!!! Will return soon!"
