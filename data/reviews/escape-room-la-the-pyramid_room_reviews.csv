"Escape room ""The Pyramid"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-pyramid,1,"My group of 8 loved, loved, loved The Pyramid (which is Mayan, not Egyptian).  My first Escape Room and we made it out.  Super colorful and multi-sensorial.  Staff Guide Theresa was all that to assist if needed.  It was so much more stimulating and challenging than I thought it would be.  Cool to see friend's skills come out.  Can't wait for the next one! "

Pretty difficult and we didn't quite finish in time to escape, but it's so well planned and interesting that no one really minded. The design is great and even better than the other rooms - just sorry that we were rushing to finish the clues and I didn't get adequate time to admire the workmanship. Highly recommended! (And if you haven't done one of these before, teamwork is a must - sharing things you've figured out with the others in the group. Don't worry, you'll all quickly become friends if you don't have a full group of your own."
