"Escape room ""Escape from Myth Room"" by San Jose Room Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/myst-escape-room-ghost-ship,0,"I've done about 10 escape rooms around the Bay Area and this was one of the best and most memorable. The theme is a ghost pirate ship, and the decorations are some of the best I've seen for an escape room, and really make you feel like you could be on a ship. You can tell the owners spent considerable time and effort to build a great immersive experience. In terms of the puzzles, I won't give anything away but they are logical and are well-intergrated with the room elements. My group ended up getting stuck on one puzzle for too long (due to not figuring out the wording properly on one clue), and just barely escaped on time."
"Escape room ""Escape from Myth Room"" by San Jose Room Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/myst-escape-room-ghost-ship,1,This was our first escape room experience.  We were ten of us and all of us had a great time.  The game was so much fun and competitive for the group and glad we were able to escape out of the room !!

What it lacked in tech it tried to make up for with the ""you must interact with the ghost"" to make it through. Not as great as the other escape rooms I've been to given the need to interact with the ghost and the low tech puzzles."

If you're bringing a group, I'd say that the optimal number of people is 6-7, but there's plenty of room for more if you have a larger crowd."
