"Escape room ""The Chocolate Factory"" by Escape Now Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-now-houston-the-chocolate-factory,0,So much fun for the whole family! Although we didn't escape we got very close & solving all the puzzles was challenging yet entertaining. We did the chocolate factory but I think the sherlock one was slightly easier. Family had to work together & we got some good laughs. Don't reccomnend bringing very young children (10 & under) bc it is a little difficult & they probably won't enjoy as much/understand.
"Escape room ""The Chocolate Factory"" by Escape Now Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-now-houston-the-chocolate-factory,1,The adventure of solving the mystery of how to get out of a locked room within an hour was a fantastic challenge in the chocolate room. I would not recommend small children because of the concentration that is needed to figure the puzzle out. Definitely going again to attempt the Sherlock Holmes room.
