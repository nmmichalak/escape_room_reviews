We decided on the Titanic room and it was a group of 4. They gave us the room to ourselves, which was greatly appreciated because the room would have been tight with more. The actual escape room was exciting and we all enjoyed the experience. Game master May did a good job explaining and facilitating. "

We picked kids against the adults in the Titanic Room and neither team made it out. Lots of fun finding keys, unlocking the clues and solving the riddles. The staff was great. Great for team building or family fun."

It was unlike anything we've ever done before. As a party of 3, we were expecting to be paired up with another group, but were pleasantly surprised to have a room all to ourselves. Our game master was great and explained everything well starting off. I thought it was really helpful being able to get hints from him, though we never took advantage of that. The clues/puzzles were challenging but not impossible, though I will say the very last one was pretty tough! The room was superbly decorated, the sound and light effects really added to the overall atmosphere and it was one of the highlights of our day. We ended up freeing ourselves, take that 28% success rate! Can't wait to come back again!"

The Pussy Cat Dolls that went to escape the room in Palm Springs. Three were rookies, so they had no idea what to expect. Two of us had done this before. We all had a blast. We did the Titanic Room and escaped with 9:44 minutes to go. Booking was easy and employees were fantastic. Would go back again."
