"Escape room ""Undercover Alley"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/breakout-games-nashville-undercover-alley,1,We had an awesome time. It was everyone’s first time doing an escape room. The staff was friendly and our game was challenging which our group liked. They gave us a few extra minutes so we could complete the entire game. Can’t wait to go back and experience a different room! Thanks!
