We had a group of 8 (max) and never felt overcrowded in any room. Each person contributed in some way to solving the puzzle to move on to the next part. We did an intermediate level - Mystery Mansion. Yes, we did ask for a hint or so and yes we did get out. JUST BARELY! Lots of Fun. You are not locked in and are monitored at all times for any emergencies. I can't wait to do another."
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/breakout-games-pittsburgh-mystery-mansion,4,We went as a staff and had a really great time. Rooms were clean and everything was well put together! We didnâ€™t quite make it but it was still a great experience. Dominic was our game master- very friendly and gave us clues without spoiling the challenge. Hope to come back with the family! We chose the Mystery Mansion game.
