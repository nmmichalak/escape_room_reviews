"Escape room ""Date Night Disaster"" by Premier Escape Adventures in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/premier-date-night-disaster,2,My husband and I were walking the East Bradenton plaza after dinner to find Premier Escape Adventures. We both were not ready to go home so we booked the 9 pm Date Night Disaster.- Before going into the room we were handcuffed together which was REALLY funny and without going into too much detail. The puzzles in the room were creative and unique! I have been in 8 escape rooms and there were puzzles I have never experienced before! - Thank you for getting us in and Lance and I are looking forward to trying out the Houdini room later in the month!
