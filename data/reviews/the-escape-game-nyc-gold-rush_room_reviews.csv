"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-gold-rush,0,"I’ve probably done close to 20 escape rooms over the past several years, and I have to say that this place ranks at the very top. I played Gold Rush, and it was an absolute blast! And not only was the room itself spectacular (the attention to detail in the design and decoration of the room was the very best I’ve seen), but the staff was top notch as well. They made my visit memorable and I am very grateful for the experience. Do not hesitate to check them out - you will not be disappointed!"

The staff was extremely courteous and clearly shared as much enthusiasm for escape rooms as we do. I've done several in the past and I have to say this was the absolute best. The room was challenging, with enough twists and turns to keep us enthralled the entire time. I highly recommend this to anyone visiting the city!"
