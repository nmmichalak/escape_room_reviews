"Escape room ""Escape from 20,000 Leagues"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-escape-from-20000-leagues,0,"I enjoyed the difficult puzzles, but for me a pivotal part of an escape room is the immersion. It is my understanding that the room has changed since I last had been there, but from my own experience I would rate it a horrible experience."
"Escape room ""Escape from 20,000 Leagues"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-escape-from-20000-leagues,1,"We went as a couple and were joined by 11 other people. Bring as many people as you can - the room is filled with a number of non-linear puzzles that each add up to megapuzzle. They were good, but didn't really connect to a story, which was a bit disappointing. Two of the employees were in the room to give us as much help as we desired. The ambiance of the room left a bit to be desired. It was just a large rectangular room with portholes affixed to the wall. Bottom line: good, logical puzzles, too many puzzles to solve within the hour unless you have a solid team and a solid team leader, great employees, very little ambiance, and very little immersive storytelling. Good, but not great."

The puzzled and clues are masterfully done, and the thrill of solving the game was wonderful! So, if you are looking for something fun to do for a corporate event, or a group of friends I highly recommend checking them out!!"

We did the 20,000 leagues under the sea one and came within about 90 seconds of solving and escaping the room. They let us finish and were really nice the entire time. a+"

Our team was only a few minutes shy of making it out of the 20,000 Leagues under the Sea..but it was still fun working together and having fun. We are a distributed work force so this was part of our annual team retreat. Loved how nice and helpful the staff was there and hope to do it again next year!"
