"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escape-the-room-denver-the-submarine,0,"My husband and I did the Submarine themed room and we won! We have done escape rooms in the past and this one was by far the most challenging. No one else booked this room so it was just my husband and I alone. It would have been MUCH easier with a couple more people and because of this I think they had to give us more clues. I also think that some of the puzzles were not logical and without a clue, I have no idea how anyone could have figured out what to do. All in all the rooms are well designed and it’s definitely an immersive experience. We had fun too! I just think some of the puzzles didn’t make a lot of sense."

What a fun experience with the kids and stressful at the same time! The submarine is my favorite ... so far!"
"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escape-the-room-denver-the-submarine,2,I came to escape the room out of the blue and wasn't disappointed! The first room I did here was the submarine and it was so cool! I loved that the puzzles were hands on locks and littles games throughout the rooms! I loved this place so much that my boyfriend and I came back to do all the rooms with in a week and some of the rooms more than once!! This places is super fun and worth the money we spent here! I highly recommend this place!
