"Escape room ""Mystery Manor"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-mystery-manor,0,"We did this room with 4 people (our other team did it with just 2). The theme is Mystery Manor. Half of our team was running late, and they were nice enough to delayed the game for us. The staff was really nice to us. The room is 3 stars, a-ok, but their customer service brought it up another star. The room wasn't really immersive, but it was definitely decorated nicely. I wish it was bigger and more puzzles though. They didn't have any tech puzzles, and more traditional lock and puzzles. I would like to see them change the room to have more hidden tech, but still keep the same theme.Looking forward to do their Virus Zero room next."

We escaped, but just barely! Our gamemaster, Tiffany, was very nice and helpful. We will definitely be back for their next room!"
