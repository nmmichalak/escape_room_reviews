The room, atmosphere and storyline truly gave me a feeling of immersion. Everyone who loves escape rooms and ready for a real challenge should try out this room."
"Escape room ""Utopia"" by Riddle Room in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/riddle-room-utopia,2,"I was among a group of 8 total people for the new Utopia challenge, which is considered 'Advanced'. We were all between 25-50 years of age. I'm someone who has a lot of experience with this sort of puzzle solving, and I still genuinely felt like having a minimum of 4 people is absolutely necessary for this room. There's physically no way to solo or even 2-person this room. The whole group felt pushed to our limits throughout the entire hour, so there was never a dull moment.Even though this wasn't a problem for me personally, do be warned that this room is quite small and becomes body-to-body once the action starts. People with claustrophobia may want to request a smaller group."
