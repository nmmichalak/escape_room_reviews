"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Art of Escape: ICT in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/the-art-of-escape-ict-the-heist,0,Just escaped from The Heist room with all the money we could grab! What a  fun room - a great time had by all!Our only complaint would be about the clues with black marker. Some were faded and could be redone.

The staff were friendly, the rules video was entertaining, and the room was very original. You don't need to be an experienced escaper to do this room. I look forward to trying the rooms they open in the future!"
