"Escape room ""The Surgery"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/The-Exit-Game-The-Surgery,0,"We were a family group of 7. I have previously done an escape room at another venue. This company impressed me so much from start to finish. Top notch! Prices were reasonable. Easy to make reservations. Pleasant customer service (I called in twice with questions).We did the room ""Surgery"". Wasn't scary or gory which is what my teammates were concerned about. These rooms makes you use your critical thinking skills which we loved the challenge. Even though these rooms are not targeted towards younger kids, we had a 9-year-old who was right there playing in the game. We decided as a group to come back and conquer another room next month. Can't wait!!"
