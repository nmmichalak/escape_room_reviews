"Escape room ""Escape the Movies"" by Laurel's House Of Horror in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/laurels-house-of-horror-escape-the-movies,0,Did the Escape the Movies room. The clues were challenging and fun up until some late comers joined the group and the fun factor went downhill from there. Was disappointed that they were allowed to join after we were 15 minutes into the game. Would have liked if they explained the challenges in more depth so don't expect it. All they will say is clues are all around you. Will definitely do it again but with ppl I know.

Made it out with barely a minute to spare! We did the Escape the Movies room, very well done. Very creepy. My adrenaline was going the entire time as our group struggled to get each door open in time. So much fun!"
