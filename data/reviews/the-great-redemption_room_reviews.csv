We were able to escape our cell by solving difficult riddles and by unlocking many locks to find 1 million dollars to clear our name and escape our room! From locks, to passwords, to blacklights, and special cameras... The Great Redemption is a definite place to go!"
"Escape room ""The Great Redemption"" by Famous Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-great-redemption,5,A very clever room with several twists on puzzles. Good use of red herrings. Enough puzzles to keep a group of six busy. Wish there were a few more as we escaped with about 10 min to spare. I enjoy getting to the last few minutes with the adrenaline pumping. Would be interested on returning if they had additional rooms.
