It was a little difficult for us, but we had a great time! We will be back someday! The staff was nice and the room was really cool!"

They had fun, and it was very tricky. We got some helpful clues but did not make it out in time! The building is nicely decorated and very cool on a hot summer day! Staff was great too. We would go back and recommend to others."
