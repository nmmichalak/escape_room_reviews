"Escape room ""From The Sky"" by Deciphered Roanoke in Roanoke",https://worldofescapes.com/roanoke/quests/deciphered-roanoke-from-the-sky,0,"An awesome place for a team building exercise, or just some family/friendly fun. The staff at Deciphered Roanoke is top notch and dedicated to an overall wonderful experience. Iâ€™d recommend it to anyone. I took my team there this past week and we had a great time. We were able to escape the From the Sky room with 6:54 left to spare. A fun time was had by all."
