"Escape room ""Chapter One: Occam's Apartment"" by Evil Genius Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/evil-genius-escape-rooms-chapter-1,0,Love this escape room! You have to do the back-to-back seamless experience for Chapter One and Two. So much fun!
"Escape room ""Chapter One: Occam's Apartment"" by Evil Genius Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/evil-genius-escape-rooms-chapter-1,1,"This was my 56th room I've played nationwide.The whole experience started before you got into the room. It was so immersive, I felt like we were living in a suspense/action movie story plot. Patrick, the gamemaster/owner/creator is also a fantastic piece of it all!I've seen most of the puzzles and tasks we had to do in other rooms I've played, but even seasoned players would appreciate their unique delivery and how carefully thought out they were that kept them in line with the story progression. The delivery of hints also fits perfectly into the theme of the whole experience. Can't wait for Chapter 2 and Chapter 3!"
"Escape room ""Chapter One: Occam's Apartment"" by Evil Genius Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/evil-genius-escape-rooms-chapter-1,2,"I've played about 20 escape rooms, and Evil Genius is one of the best I've done. Interesting puzzle, nice scenery, and immersive atmosphere. Not to mention a fully custom soundtrack for the room, which is awesome AND unique! The story is well done, and you become emotionally invested in it quickly. I'm excited to see what Episode 2 has in store."
