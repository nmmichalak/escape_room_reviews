"Escape room ""Cold War Crisis"" by American Escape Rooms in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/american-escape-rooms-orlando-cold-war-crisis,1,We had a good time doing Cold War Crisis. This was our first escape room and apparently we picked the hardest room. It was a little hairy at the end. We only used 3 clues and stopped the bomb with 11:52 left on our clock. We were told we were the best of the week. Can't wait to try another one.
