"Escape room ""Fatal Attraction"" by Cracked Norman in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/cracked-norman-fatal-attraction,1,I took five 12-13 year old girls to do Fatal Attraction. I really liked the way there was more of a theme to the room and puzzles instead of just a series of random puzzles you find in some escape rooms. We got out with 25 minutes remaining and all of the girls had a blast!

It was so much fun! It's a great way to work as a team! I love that it's narrative based. Would highly recommend this room! Can't wait to go back for another one!
