"Escape room ""Patient 37"" by Puzzled Escape in Brighton",https://worldofescapes.com/brighton-mi/quests/puzzled-escape-patient-37,0,Awesome experience. We did the patient 37 room and what a theme. This was well worth the drive and to top it off we are the new record holders with an escape of 37ish minutes. Thanks for having us!
