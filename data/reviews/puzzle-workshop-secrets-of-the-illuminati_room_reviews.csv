"Escape room ""Secrets of the Illuminati"" by Puzzle Workshop in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/puzzle-workshop-secrets-of-the-illuminati,0,"My family and I completed their CSI: Hollywood room and we LOVED it! Awesome decorations, well-designed puzzles. I hear their owners make games at Blizzard Entertainment, so that explains why the puzzles are so well done. The staff was really friendly and made sure we had the right amount of hints so we felt challenged but not stuck. I can't wait to check out their Illuminati room - I hear that has some cool moments too. "
"Escape room ""Secrets of the Illuminati"" by Puzzle Workshop in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/puzzle-workshop-secrets-of-the-illuminati,1,"My group of friends have grown a love for escape rooms and the Puzzle Workshop: Illuminati room was the third one we've done together. I liked the variety of puzzles that we had to solve and the overall flow from one puzzle to the next seemed very intuitive and linear. The tech in the rooms were also very cool and think those always add a very neat ""wow"" factor! I actually think the Illuminati room was fairly easy compared to the ones we've done in the past. The waiting area is very clean and nicer than most of the other escape rooms I've done. The manager, Stephanie, was very kind and friendly. "

The Illuminati Escape Room was really straightforward and needless to say, the four of us escaped. PLOT: you are trapped in an office trying to steal a valuable Egyptian statuette and you need to escape before the Illuminati overlords come back.The clues, puzzles, tech, storyline were all so much fun and very well done. They were diverse, challenging and more importantly a lot of fun to solve. We were constantly busy! There is a staff member monitoring your progress, who gives out hints (unlimited) if you really need them. When we arrived, we were greeted by Stephanie who was really kind, helpful, and super sweet! Overall, this is probably the funnest escape room that I've ever encountered and I can't wait to try out their second room!"
