"Escape room ""Subway Escape"" by Escape Room Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/escape-room-pittsburgh-subway-escape,0,The subway multi room escape was verry cool and challenging. The puzzles were not easy but that's what we hoped for. Groups of 4 would be perfect because we had 7 and there were alot people waiting around for sonething to do alot of the time since it goes in stages one step at a time in a particular order. The host was awesome and gave us tips to move along in the right direction if we were wasting too much time on a step that we weren't ready for yet. We escaped with 59 seconds left! Will def go back again and recommend.

That being said, I found this room to be their easiest, and it has the least interesting storyline of the three rooms. I've escaped from all of their rooms, and I did this one in record time with no hints. Don't get me wrong, some of the stuff is so amazingly cool, you'll be asking how they did that! And it's still one of the most advanced and immersive escape rooms in the Pittsburgh area."

It was super fun! We finished with 11 minutes to spare. I am only sad because we can't do it again!"
