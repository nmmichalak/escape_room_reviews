"Escape room ""Paranormal Escape"" by Castle of Chaos in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/chaos-escape-rooms-paranormal-escape,0,"8 of us did the Paranormal Escape room. It said it held up to 10 people, but any more I don't think we would have had room to move around. 6-8 is a good number for this room. It was very well out together,  clues were not to hard but hard enough were we had to really think. We did have to ask for help a few times. They gave us just enough of a clue to where we still had to search but we were going in the right direction at least. Staff was friendly.Bathrooms need to be picked up, they were a mess."

The paranormal room was very G rated. No yelling and screaming like I thought it might be. I was envisioning a haunted house yelling match, but it was more finding clues to lead you to the next clue... Not sure about kids, but fun for adults! Probably best for a group of 4-6. We will be back!"
