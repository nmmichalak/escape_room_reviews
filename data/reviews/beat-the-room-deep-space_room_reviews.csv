"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-deep-space,0,Had a blast doing Deep Space! Love the two new rooms! Great puzzles with a good variety. Everything in good shape and explanation of game/goal easy to understand. Huge plus...we made it out!! We did it with only four of us and loved doing it as a small group. Great fun!
"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-deep-space,1,"A friend and I came here to experience the Deep Space room and loved it! The room was very atmospheric, the puzzles were challenging but not impossible, and our ""Mission Control"" was very helpful! We didn't escape the room before the timer ran out but we did have a blast! This place is definitely recommended for a good time regardless of whether you win or not."
