"Escape room ""Escape the Colosseum"" by The Great Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/the-great-escape-room-tampa-escape-the-colosseum,0,We are Escape Enthusiasts with a lot of experience. We did the Colosseum Room with five people. Great puzzles. Great atmosphere. The staff was super nice. We had a slight malfunction in the room when we played and they handled it very professionally.  We will definitely be back to play the other rooms.

The theme elements were perfect including torches instead of flashlights.  I am close to twenty escape rooms, and this is one of the best! I would highly recommend this escape room!"

We did the Colosseum experience and it was very well done.  Props and scenery were great.  I thought some of the puzzles were really hard to put together, but this is only the second escape room I have done.  The group had a great time.  Would definitely try another of their rooms."
