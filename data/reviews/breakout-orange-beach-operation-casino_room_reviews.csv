"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Orange - Beach in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/breakout-orange-beach-operation-casino,0,"We pulled off a daring rescue mission at the Casino Royale today. Despite 007 getting himself into a bad spot, we all escaped with our lives, armed with nothing but our wits and cunning (and a few key assists from GM Elijah). A great time was had by all."
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Orange - Beach in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/breakout-orange-beach-operation-casino,1,We loved our experience at Breakout Orange Beach!! Our game master Jessica was simply superb. The game was extremely challenging and so much fun!! Our 8 ages ranged from 13-40 something and all of us had a blast. We did Casino Royale and hope to go back soon for the other games. Definitely worth the money and time! Thanks Jessica for showing us a fantastic night and helping us breakout with thirty seconds to spare!

The staff were fantastic from start to finish. Friendly, helpful and went out of their way to provide excellent customer service. The game was so fun and very challenging! We all had a blast. Our ages ranged from 13 to 42. We did not escape, but came close and now can hardly wait to come back. Mike, our game master was fantastic. Do yourself a favor and go play."

Everyone loved it!!! Everyone was involved and working together. We didn't breakout but in the end we didn't really care. Thanks for the experience!!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Orange - Beach in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/breakout-orange-beach-operation-casino,4,You guys are awesome. Very professional staff. We really enjoyed casino royale. For having only two people we have currently made it the farthest two people have ever made it so far. That was per the game master for that room. We will definitely be back here the next time we are down here.
