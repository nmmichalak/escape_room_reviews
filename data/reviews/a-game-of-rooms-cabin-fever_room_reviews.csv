No countdown clock in room. One of the better waiting rooms we've been visited. Room aesthetics are decent, much better than 'escape detention'. There are a lot of puzzles that can be done in parallel, so probably better for large groups. Has some novel puzzles that one wouldn't expect for a cabin setting. Some of the puzzles are quite challenging. A very fun room."

I've done upwards of 15 rooms in several different states and this is definitely one I will go back to. We did the cabin room and everything from the decor to the puzzles were well above my expectations. Absolutely cannot wait to try and escape the new prision room they are working on."

And although it was challenging, we all loved the experience we had at the Cabin Fever room! Would definitely recommend this for a group with some to lots of experience with escape rooms. I can't wait to try the Prison Break room soon!"
