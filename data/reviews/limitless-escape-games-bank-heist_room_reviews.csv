"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Limitless Escape Games in Livermore",https://worldofescapes.com/livermore/quests/limitless-escape-games-bank-heist,0,Visited this place for a corporate event and loved it. I've been to several of these escape rooms and this was by far the cleanest one. The game was well organized and challenging. Everything about this location was top notch. Highly recommend. We did the bank heist theme and everyone loved it.
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Limitless Escape Games in Livermore",https://worldofescapes.com/livermore/quests/limitless-escape-games-bank-heist,1,This was an awesome experience with family and friends. We escaped! But we did ask for some hints! Nathan was our game master and he gave us good hints that pointed us in the right direction but still allowed us to think and solve the puzzles. We did the Bank Heist which is supposed to be the easiest of the three rooms by Limitless Escape Games. We have to come back and try the others!

Ryan worked with my now-fianc√© to set up one amazing proposal in the Diamond Heist room. Thank you for the wonderful memories!"
