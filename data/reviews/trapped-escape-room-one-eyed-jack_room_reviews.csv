"Escape room ""One Eyed Jack"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/trapped-escape-room-one-eyed-jack,0,"Our team of three thoroughly enjoyed both rooms at Trapped! We have done over 100 Escape Rooms and would put One Eyed Jack and Puzzle Master in our top 10 rooms. The puzzles are clever with very few locks and keys which we prefer. The rooms were challenging yet had a nice flow that made sense once you got going. If you love Escape Rooms, Trapped is a must do while in Vegas!"

We did the room called ""One eyed Jack"" and let me tell you it keeps you on your toes and looking over you shoulder. The room was full of clues and puzzles. Again it was fun but if you do not finish in one hour one eyed Jack will come after you."

Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/trapped-escape-room-one-eyed-jack,2,"This was my first escape room, but it was so much fun! We did the One Eyed Jack Room because the staff recommended it for two people, and it was a good suggestion. They give you hints if you ask so you don't feel like a complete dummy, but even then it was manageable! There isn't live actors, so you aren't randomly spooked, and you get to focus on just getting out... more than anything you just scare yourself. The staff was super friendly and awesome, and we're definitely coming back with more friends!"
