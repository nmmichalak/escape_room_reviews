"Escape room ""Zookeeper"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-zookeeper,0,Had a great time working in the Mad Hatter's Tea Party for my daughter's 14th birthday. We were paired with 4 others that we did not know but worked to have the best time of the week! Returned a week later to testout the Zookeeper for kids which was awesome and my eight-year-old absolutely loved it! Wholesome and engaging fun for every age!

We will definitely go back!"
"Escape room ""Zookeeper"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-zookeeper,2,What a blast. We did the zookeeper room since we had our 8 year old and 3 year old with us and it was perfect. Our 3 year old was busy with all the animal things in the room and the rest of us were busy solving our mission. Nothing like a room for 6-12 year olds to make an adult feel a little less than though haha Hands down recommend this for anyone who wants to be fully engulfed in a game and have fun. We will absolutely return.
