My brother came into town and it was a fun exercise to work through the puzzles with him and my husband. The owners were great and gave some assistance along the way without giving too much feedback. They were very animated and stayed in character, we were very impressed! We will definitely go back sometime in the future!"

Our family of 5 was hooked from our very first room, and have since completed several rooms, we would highly recommend Lokey’s Escape Room! We escaped Trouble in Tinseltown; this room had a unique storyline, realistic props and decor, clever and challenging puzzles, and we LOVED the “in character” assignment intro! Another HUGE advantage of using Lokey’s is having a private room, we love being able to work together as a family."

Trouble in Tinseltown was beyond what we expected- awesome clues, fun and constantly moving AND the room was awesomely staged in all black and white! Our group had so much fun and we cannot WAIT to come back and try Detention and Press Start! Thanks again Richard!!"
