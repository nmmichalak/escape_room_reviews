"Escape room ""Curse of the Undead"" by Epic Escape Game in Cheyenne",https://worldofescapes.com/cheyenne/quests/epic-escape-game-curse-of-the-undead,1,This place is awesome! My wife and I went here for a date night and did the curse of the Zombie room. We were only able to solve half the puzzle in the allotted time. We had a BLAST. The staff is friendly and really works to accommodate scheduling needs. The whole thing is just a great idea! It's about 25 dollars a person and is worth every red cent. The puzzles are varied and include having to find codes and do some math and really observe the environment you're in. I can't wait to go again.
