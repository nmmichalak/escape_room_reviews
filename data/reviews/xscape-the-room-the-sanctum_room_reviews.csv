"Escape room ""The Sanctum"" by Xscape The Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/xscape-the-room-the-sanctum,0,"just did the Artist sanctum room today and omg it was amazing.  So creatively done, this one is a great option for puzzle oriented and creative types.  Although we didn't escape we came sooooo close, another 5 mins and we would of had it.  Oh well just means we have to go back and try another!"

I recommend it for a group of friends, family, or colleagues for team building.  We did the Artist Sanctum and although we didn't finish (we were close) everyone had fun and the room was really well done.  The staff was friendly, Candy was our host and she was great!  We'll be going back to try other rooms soon.  It's addictive!"

Will definitely be back to do the Classroom in the near future!"
