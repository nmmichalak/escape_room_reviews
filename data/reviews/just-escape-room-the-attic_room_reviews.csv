"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-the-attic,0,Went here last night for my brother in laws birthday.  There were six of us.  We did the Attic and finished in 48 minutes (with 4 people who never did an escape room before!)  It was fun.  The staff was absolutely phenomenal!  They couldn't have been nicer and explained everything thoroughly to us novices.  I am going to give this as a gift to my children and their spouses as a Christmas gift.  Thanks for a great time (and a reasonable price!!)

"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-the-attic,2,We did the Attic. Very entertaining and challenging. Great for older kids... my 7 and 9-year-old really enjoyed it! We will be back to try another room for sure!
