"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology San Diego in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapology-sd-the-code,2,"This was my first escape room! I had a great experience and it was totally challenging. Miranda and Kris were really good game hosts, teaching us how to play and pretty much everything we need to know. We finished our game (COD3) in just 40 minutes which was pretty impressive for us haha. This escape place makes me want to try out other escape places. Def coming back here in the near future!"

"Escape room ""Th3 C0d3"" by Escapology San Diego in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapology-sd-the-code,4,We took the family for the C0d3 and had an absolute blast. Game master Augustus was the best. Great personality and made our visit very memorable. The props and decor totally immerse you into the puzzle. Suttle hints were nice touch without giving the solution away. Everyone came away excited we escaped with 2 minutes.... even the 7 and 10 yr olds had a blast and was able to contribute. We will definitely visit again should we make it back to San Diego or another of the franchise locations.
