Our clue master, Pacific, was fun and very helpful. The Conspiracy Theory room was a challenge but we were able to pull it off (with thanks to Pacific)! Thanks again for the great time and you can bet your buns we will be back! "

This was the first escape room for all four of us, so we didn't really know what to expect going in. The scenario, puzzles, and atmosphere were great. We ended up solving the puzzle with about 10 minutes to spare. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We had an absolute blast and next time we're in the Denver area, we'll be back!"
