It was excellent in design, difficulty and variety of challenges! I have done rooms in Denver and Las Vegas. This was just as good, actually better, than these. Uses an iPad to get clues, so more high tech than just a walkie talkie. A+."

We love it and I think we have a new addiction! We escaped Alcatraz tonight, attempted yesterday but got stumped. I love how it makes you use your brain and we are a competitive family so this is so much fun for us!!"
