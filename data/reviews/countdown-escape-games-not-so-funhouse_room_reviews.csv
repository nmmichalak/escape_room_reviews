"Escape room ""Not So Funhouse"" by Count:down Escape Games in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/countdown-escape-games-not-so-funhouse,0,Amazing time here with my family! Super nice and talkative host! Great room! Crazy decor! Difficult tasks but definitely worth the try! Not-So-Fun House was a blast! And all three parts were decorated from top to bottom! Will be back to try the rest of the rooms! Have been to about 5 other Escape room businesses and this is for sure one of my top favorites so far! Thank you for the great experience !
