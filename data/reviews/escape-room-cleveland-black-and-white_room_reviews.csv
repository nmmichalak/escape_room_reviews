"Escape room ""Black & White"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-black-and-white,1,"I'm so happy we only live 4 minutes from this place. Last weekend, we rented an Escape Room with 6 people in our group. We took the option of renting the whole room so we could try to escape without the interruption of ""outsiders"" :)The entire experience was so much fun. The guy who checked us in (I can't remember his name, Joe, maybe) was so enthusiastic and genuinely welcomed us and talked us through the process, as this was all of our first time in an Escape Room. After a quick briefing, we were left in the room. Once the door closes and locks, you have 60 minutes to unlock the door after solving multiple puzzles, deciphering clues and building on each of them. We picked the Black & White room, although there were other options like a Chocolate Factory Room, CSI Room, Superhero Room & Bomb Squad Room. Man, we were stumped. We couldn't even figure out the first step. You have the option to use 5 clues if you want, which we had to use all of them and we still didn't figure it out. It was such a fun experience. I can't wait to take some of my co-workers and boss - it will be a great teambuilder. After you're released from the room, they have a ton of fun little prop signs you can use for pictures with your group. I can't wait to try the next room!!!Definitely worth the money!"
