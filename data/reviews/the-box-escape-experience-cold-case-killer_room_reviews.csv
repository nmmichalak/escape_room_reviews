"Escape room ""Cold Case Killer"" by The Box Escape Experience in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/the-box-escape-experience-cold-case-killer,0,"I’ve done nearly 10 rooms and the two current rooms at The Box are by far in my top three favorites (especially the Cold Case Killer!) The story lines are interesting and keep you highly engaged. What truly sets them apart is Andy, who runs the front and acts as the “room master.” He is in character from the moment you walk in the building; he builds up the excitement and sets the scene to keep you on edge the whole time. Highly recommend checking this place out, you will not regret it!"
