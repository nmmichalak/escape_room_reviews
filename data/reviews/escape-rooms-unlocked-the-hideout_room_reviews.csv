The rooms are addictive for puzzle lovers like myself and a combination of challenging but family friendly (I have done one of them with a 6 year old). Besides the rooms, the staff is a huge reason why we keep coming back- they are friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. So thankful to have a recreational gem like this in Charlotte County/ North Port!"
