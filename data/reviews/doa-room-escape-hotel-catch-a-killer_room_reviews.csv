"Escape room ""Hotel-Catch a Killer"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/doa-room-escape-hotel-catch-a-killer,0,"If you are in the area, you need to get locked in these rooms. The clues are challenging, but solvable. The staff is fantastic. We did both the Hotel and the Basement, and they were very different and both extremely fun. If you've ever wanted to be immersed into a real-life iphone app, this is your place. There are many ""aha"" moments when you combine clues and figure out the next step that are very satisfying. If you are adventurous, creative, and looking for a great evening of fun, check it out. I can't wait for more rooms to do it again."
