"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Escape the Room Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-the-room-minneapolis-agency,0,We did the Agency room. It was fun and definitely made us work to get out of the room. Would recommend if you love puzzles.
"Escape room ""The Agency"" by Escape the Room Minneapolis in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-the-room-minneapolis-agency,1,"Went with two other friends to do ""The Agency"" and ""The Dig"". We had such a blast. I have to say that so far the Agency was my favorite. It was very challenging and there were so many secret trap rooms and doors! It is more oriented towards riddle, logic, and puzzles. Such a blast and so worth the money! We didn't escape but came close."

He chose The Agency. Several of our party had done these type of events before but they said, hands down, this was the most interesting and well-done ""escape room"" fun they had ever had. We definitely want to do one again and soon."
