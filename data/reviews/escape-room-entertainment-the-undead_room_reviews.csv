We did the Undead Room and it was incredibly challenging, which our group thoroughly enjoyed. The staff is friendly, helpful, and you can tell they enjoy their job. I am definitely going to come all the way back from Port St. Lucie to try the other rooms!"

The zombies were just quicker then we were. The guy kept saying that even though we were broken into 2 teams we had to work together and communication was the key. Apparently, we figured out how important that was just a little too late...like an entire room too late lol."

It was a perfect mix of locks and physical puzzles that really added to the story and immersive experience! The size of the rooms were great and very detailed. It was an awesome time, cannot wait to go back!"

My first escape room event was better than I had hoped for. The staff was incredibly friendly and professional. More than worth the price. Great time and great place...sets/rooms were spot on and gave you the feeling you were actually there.
