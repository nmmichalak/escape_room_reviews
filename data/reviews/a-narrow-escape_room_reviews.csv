Our family experienced many challenges in solving, but with help and extensive guess-and-check, in the end it was extremely fun."

We did the story where we tried to break out of an abandoned lab with the help of a Robot named Ada. The story was intriguing, the riddles where clever, and my family had fun over all. Kudos to the guy who put this together."
"Escape room ""The Bionic Dilemma"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape,5,"My wife and I took our precocious grandkids, ages 13 and 8, to our first ""escape room"" adventure while on their Spring Break last week. It was the highlight of the whole week. Working as a team, we solved the room's various puzzles, found keys and codes and brain twisting solutions to riddles, problems and posers of all sorts. Ada the trapped Robot became a friend and ally of invaluable worth as we strove to save us all before the power drained out for the ""subterranean"" lab we had stumbled into. Loads of fun and well worth the modest expense. Triple Wow! "
