"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Great Escape Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/the-great-escape-clovis-the-heist,0,Our family chose to do an escape room as part of our annual birthday celebration. All but one of us were 1st timers and we had a great time. The Heist room was challenging and our guide gave us excellent directions and some helpful hints.It was the only escape venue I could find that was open on a Wednesday and it a great first experience! We'll be back.
