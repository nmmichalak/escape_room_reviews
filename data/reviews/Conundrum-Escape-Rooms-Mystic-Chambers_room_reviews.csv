"Escape room ""Mystic Chamber"" by Conundrum Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/Conundrum-Escape-Rooms-Mystic-Chambers,0,We were visiting family in Denver and decided to do an escape game! After doing some research we all agreed on Conundrum. We had such a great time! The man who greeted us was super friendly and informative. The room itself was really great. We played Mystic Chambers. Without giving away too much about it - I will say I was impressed with the special effects it had. I would definitely go back! Highly recommend.

This was my first escape room experience, and I guess I expected it to be cheesy. But it wasn't, it was so well done and we really enjoyed ourselves. We went with four of us (two couples) and it was exactly the right size group for the mystic chambers room. 6 would be okay but 4 is better. We went for my husbands birthday and it was a really great time. Highly recommend."
