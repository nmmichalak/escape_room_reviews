"Escape room ""The Frozen Grove"" by Last Minute Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/last-minute-escape-frozen-grove,0,"Great place for a fun time with family, friends, or coworkers. The Frozen Grove was really entertaining for little ones, but challenging enough for teens and grown-ups. Definitely worth the trip."

We did a few rooms at the Wayne location including the Duke's Palace, Frozen Grove, and the Speakeasy. All very different but well thought out, great puzzles, and immersive scenery!"
"Escape room ""The Frozen Grove"" by Last Minute Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/last-minute-escape-frozen-grove,2,"We brought a small group of 9 year old boys (and an 11 year old girl) here for our son's birthday party, and they all had a great time!  The puzzles were difficult enough that they needed some clues, but not so hard that they couldn't eventually solve them. We highly recommend the Frozen Grove room for kids!"
