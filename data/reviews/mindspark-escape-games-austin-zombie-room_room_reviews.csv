"Escape room ""Zombie Room"" by Mindspark Escape Games in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/mindspark-escape-games-austin-zombie-room,0,We had my son's 16th birthday here.  The staff was amazing with a group of rowdy teens.  I can't wait to come back with a group of my friends to do it!  The clues were challenging and fun and the sets are goregeous!

Our group finished with a few minutes to spare. I will admit that the live Zombie scared me more than it should have! I definitely recommend this place. The staff was friendly and the characters did a great job.

The acting is exceptional, the puzzles are hard, the room was difficult but fun. We got stuck a couple times and were able to ask for hints. Great date idea or just to have fun with friends or to meet new people! We will definitely be going back and trying other rooms."

It was so exhilarating! We were always on edge when the zombie got close to us! The clues were challenging but not impossible. I definitely want to come back and try the Terminal!"

I came in with good expectations but they were blown out of the water when I entered the Zombie room. The clues were complex, but not impossible by any means. The staff was great and dedicated to their roles which made the whole experience very immersive. Will definitely recommend time and time again to friends and family looking for a great experience."
