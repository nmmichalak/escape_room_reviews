"Escape room ""Plantation Mystery"" by Escape Hilo in Hilo",https://worldofescapes.com/hawaii/quests/escape-hilo-plantation-escape,0,I'm in love with escape rooms! Escape Hilo - thank you for finally bringing this here! You’re given a little history of the old plantation days and then are sent on a mission to retrieve Jiro’s sword (an old family heirloom). This is definitely not the easiest escape room I’ve done BUT the harder they are the more exciting they are! Can’t wait to see what other rooms will be developed!

I was a like worried as we had no previous knowledge of Japanese history, but it was not required. We had two 9-year-olds with us and they had a blast too! Can’t wait for their next challenge."
