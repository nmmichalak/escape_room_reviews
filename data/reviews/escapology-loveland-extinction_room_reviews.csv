We did ""Extinction"" and barely made it out in time to ""save the world!"" It was challenging and fun, great for our group of 2 teens, 1-11 yr old, and a couple of moms. We'll be back!"

All of the theming is really cool, and the puzzles are pretty challenging.  The lobby is really cool looking and they brief you for the room really well. I love how they even had a briefing area before going into the room, unlike where others just kinda put you into the room and say ""you have one hour"" Our group did the extinction room, which was so much fun! There's a bunch of costumes and stuff you can put on and we all just had an absolute blast! I can't wait to try another room!"

We were a group of 4 people and barely made it out the 'Extinction' in time with only 46 seconds left! Great setup, great riddles to solve and codes to find. Nice clean place. Definitely recommend this escape game!"
