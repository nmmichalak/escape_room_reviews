"Escape room ""Hostage in Toyland"" by Race 2 Escape in Albany (GA)",https://worldofescapes.com/albany-ga/quests/race-2-escape-hostage-in-toyland,0,I am an avid lover of escape rooms and all kinds of brain puzzles so it was great to get to bring my 16-year-old niece and 10-year-old nephew into a world that I love. We joined a family of 6 others who also had young kids. We were in the Hostage in Toyland and we ended up beating the room with 6 minutes left. We had a ball!
