"Escape room ""Genie Ransom"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-genie-ransom,0,"I brought my daughter and three of her friends (all smart 14 year olds - only two of which had done an escape room before) to this location, and we had a great time. The man who helped us was fun and kind, and we were able to escape the Genie room with 4 minutes to spare. Whew! Challenging but not impossible, that room was perfect for the girls. Note: since the girls were under 16, I had to purchase a ticket and be in the room as well. This was actually a good thing because they needed a bit of help here and there. Thanks so much for a great memory!"

I, finally, had a chance to take my husband as a surprise for his birthday. The owner was so friendly and understanding when we showed up late! (We called first and he was so nice.) The coded door to get in is very fun. The waiting area is on the roof of the building and was genuinely stunning to walk into. We did the Genie room because it was the easiest room and there was only the two of us. We ended up making the Top 10 wall. He offered us a promo for a second room and ended up doing The Enchanted Forest immediately after. The Enchanted Forest is beautiful/creepy ambience and a total immersion experience. I loved this room so much. Even the scary features that I did not want to go near. We didn't make the Top 10 wall in this room but that's okay. We talked to the owner about creating the rooms and he was so personable. I can only say good things about this experience. We will definitely be back to try the other two rooms!"
