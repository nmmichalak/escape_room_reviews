"Escape room ""Submarine"" by Twisted Room Escapes in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/twisted-room-escapes-submarine,0,"Escaped from the submarine room for a friend's birthday--such a fun way to spend time together! We were able to bring coffee and laugh at each other as we struggled to find clues to solve the puzzle of how to escape this very well planned room. The storyline was a bit silly, but no sillier than us accidentally taking apart things that weren't actually clues... Definitely invite your more observant friends if you decide to do this particular room!The employees were extremely friendly and design all of their rooms. If you're worried about level of difficulty, just ask for a room recommendation when you make your reservation. I look forward to spending quality time with friends at this site again!"

This was a first for 2 of us and kids had been to 4 or 5 escape rooms. It was fun and difficult. We made it out with 2 seconds to spare. Granted we needed quite a few hints. Apparently this is one of their more difficult rooms. Without help, I think we would've needed 3 or 4 hours. I'm excited to try another now that I have a basic understanding of how the puzzles work. The operators were very nice. It's a good thing they have us hints or we would've went down with the ship."
"Escape room ""Submarine"" by Twisted Room Escapes in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/twisted-room-escapes-submarine,2,Me and my wife have been here twice. We have escaped the Submarine Room as well as the Cabin. Both rooms were a lot of fun and very challenging and require team members to work together. The puzzles were challenging and the entire group had a blast working together.
