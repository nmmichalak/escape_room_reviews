"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-the-heist,0,Had a blast with both The Heist and the Gold Rush experiences at The Escape Room. The rooms were challenging and satisfying. (Though the Gold Rush was very dimly lit and I had trouble seeing details with my older eyes!) A good blend of puzzle solving skills and tasks. The staff couldn't have been nicer. So much fun!
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-the-heist,1,"I came here as a part of a group of 7 and we tried the Art Heist challenge. The staff was super eager and friendly and explained to us how Escape Game worked and what our goal was.Art Heist was one of the more difficult games, and it definitely challenged us! But we pushed through and we were able to complete the game with about six minutes to spare! Along the way, there was a ton of laughs, fun, communication, and collaboration amongst the friends. I'd say those are key to completing these escape games - of course you have to use the noggin too! Some clues weren't interpreted simply by using common sense!Anyway, my friends and I had so much fun that when we left, we signed up for another Escape Game - the most difficult one! And if you sign up for another challenge before you leave, you get a discount of 20% off!I highly recommend giving this place a try. It opened only a week prior to us going, so it was super clean, very organized, and really well put. Go with friends, family, or even as a team building event!"

This was the perfect choice. The Heist was challenging and we loved it! Ashleigh was so helpful in explaining the game and assisting us throughout. She made the experience go from amazing to phenomenal. Definitely was a great bonding experience for us. We canâ€™t wait to try the other games when we come back. Thanks for so much fun!!!

We had a blast escaping The Heist room! It was very challenging yet rewarding when we escaped with a few seconds to spare.

The staff was friendly, helpful, and engaging throughout my visit. I also really appreciated that The Escape Game's standard of presentation was also taken seriously, as there are some escape game companies in New York that take its customers for granted.I played ""The Heist,"" which was a challenging but great introductory room for those who are interested in what a good escape room looks and feels like. It had a little bit of everything, in terms of puzzle design, so there's opportunity for everyone in your group to contribute and shine. With the right group of people working with you, this room is definitely worth the NYC price."
