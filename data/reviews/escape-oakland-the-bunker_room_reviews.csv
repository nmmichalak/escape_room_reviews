If you're looking for a fun and unusual experience in the Bay area, this is the place the check out. The room was challenging but very interesting, and got our creative juices flowing as a team! Owners were warm and friendly (and helped us when we needed some clues ). Highly recommend!"

"Escape room ""The Bunker"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-the-bunker,2,"What an adventure! We had a blast, and I can't wait to go back! ""The Bunker"" was full of surprises, and it was perfect for our group of friends. We were able to escape from the room with a few clues. The location is perfect with a lot of street parking and walking distance to the bart station. The host was awesome! She explained all rules to us as for some of us it was first escape room. Thanks a lot!!!"
