"Escape room ""Fair Game"" by Red Door Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-fort-worth-fair-game,2,We had fun playing Fair Game! We have been to the location in Plano and were expecting the same level of game play. I actually think this location is better! The area has lots of restaurants and other shopping around. Our game master was great! Only downside was that I'm not sure that we got entered in the rewards system because the game master couldn't pull up our accounts. We will be back for more fun soon!
