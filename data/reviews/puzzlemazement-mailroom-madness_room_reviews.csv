There were just 2 of us in Mailroom Madness, and even though we needed an extra 8 minutes, we did complete it. Our game master was fun and super helpful and you can tell he really loves his work. The puzzles were so much fun! There weren't any that were over-the-top frustrating, but we did definitely need some help. We will definitely be back for more!"

I brought my 18-year-old son, who doesn't get too excited about things these days. Boy was this place a hit! He led the charge in obtaining the first of many clues. It's a great place to reconnect with family."

I would recommend doing the doll house themed escape room. Ariel, who was working that night was a great storyteller and perfect host."
