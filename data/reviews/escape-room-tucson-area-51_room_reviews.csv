"Escape room ""Area 53: Lunar Lockdown"" by Escape Room Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/escape-room-tucson-area-51,6,"My hubby and I have been 3 times now and have had so much fun... whether we escape or not. It can be a little challenging to find something new and exciting in Tucson, but this is always a blast! The owner is super friendly and personable. The rooms being at different levels allows you to find something fun for your group without being in over your head. We have such an enjoyable time whether we win or lose. So, if you are like me, a sometimes overly bored Tucsonan, get some friends together and try something new!"
