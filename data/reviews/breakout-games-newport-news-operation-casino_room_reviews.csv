"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Newport News in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/breakout-games-newport-news-operation-casino,0,"Just got done with my first escape room ever, so I don’t have anything to compare it to, but that was one of the most fun things I’ve ever done. Darrel was extremely nice and a fun host. We did the Operation Casino. I highly recommend it. Definitely will be back to do every scenario."
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Newport News in Newport News",https://worldofescapes.com/newport-news/quests/breakout-games-newport-news-operation-casino,1,This was mine and my husband's first escape room. Our game master was Tiffany and she was absolutely a sweetheart. I love that the game masters can talk to you and joke and give you hints. She was fun to work with. We didn't make it out in time cuz we got stuck on one puzzle but Tiffany came down to our room and gave us a quick hint on how it worked. The casino room has a fun surprise too!! We absolutely can not wait to do this again!!!

Our game master, (I think that's what his position is called) Jay was great and gave us super helpful hints (as many as we needed). He made it such a fun and exciting experience!! The Casino room needed a lot of math so be prepared, but was a super fun game- we made it out with 22 seconds to spare!"
