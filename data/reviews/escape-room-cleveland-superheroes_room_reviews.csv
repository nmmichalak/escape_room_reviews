"Escape room ""Superheroes"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-superheroes,0,"This place was great. Haven't been to anything like this before so I wasn't sure what to expect. My group did the superhero room and we definitely had to use teamwork to solve the puzzles. I've heard of other spots where people can do problem solving in their own but this definitely wasn't the case here. The problems really got you thinking and I was glad we had the option to get clues from the ""eye in the sky"" when needed. We escaped with 10 minutes to spare and had a great time! I look forward to going back and trying another room!"

Staff was friendly and very very helpful. Our first time trying the Strongsville escape room and we will definitely be back with more people. That's to the staff for taking such great care of us. The superheroes room was fun!
