"Escape room ""The Cursed"" by Immersion in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/immersion-orange-the-cursed,0,"Came here on my birthday with a group of friends and it was such a fun time! It's in a weird area but don't be fooled by the surroundings. There was only one worker there who was a girl and had a nose piercing and I wish I remembered her name but she was very kind. Definitely recommend this place, especially for birthdays or other celebrations. We did the newest room called ""Cursed"" and it was very achievable to solve for a group who has never been to an escape room before (go sister squad!) Totally recommend"
"Escape room ""The Cursed"" by Immersion in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/immersion-orange-the-cursed,1,"One of the best escape rooms in Orange! SO and I tried out ""The Curse,"" and it was very entertaining. They do a wonderful job of making each puzzle unique and fresh, that way you don't go through the motion of just solving through the escape room with just one type of problem. I would definitely recommend! :)"
"Escape room ""The Cursed"" by Immersion in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/immersion-orange-the-cursed,2,"Did the Cursed escape room at Immersion and this room was on a whole  nother level compared to the other rooms that they own. The room is their latest room and they use modern tech for their cursed room. If you are thinking booking a room at Immersion, might I suggest the Cursed room over their other out-dated rooms. But in case you haven't guessed it from the room's name,  Cursed, expect it to be scary.The room is pretty packed but not overly expansive. A group of 4 seems ideal. Couples will likely experience a difficult time at Cursed while large groups will bump into each a lot in the cramped spaces.I did think the theme and story of the room was by far, the most bizarre plot I've experienced. But hey, that doesn't affect the quality of the room."
