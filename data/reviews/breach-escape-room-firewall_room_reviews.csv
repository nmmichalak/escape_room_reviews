"Escape room ""Firewall"" by Breach Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/breach-escape-room-firewall,0,"Went with my husband for a mini date night. We did the Firewall Escape Room, just us two and it was perfect.This escape room is definitely family friendly and was not scary as some other Escape rooms out there & definitely a good challenge.Needless to say, I recommend it and will be coming back with some of our friends to do the other room!"
