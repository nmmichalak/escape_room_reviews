"Escape room ""The Vault"" by Escape Kemah in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-kemah-the-vault,0,Loved Escape Kemah! The owners were involved and were accommodating when we had a late guest. Room was set up very well! Will definitely be back.

I wouldn't say they were experts on focusing or problem solving (what excited 9-yo girls are?), but they enjoyed every moment of it. We appreciate the memories and fun. Looking forward to returning with ADULTS some time!"
"Escape room ""The Vault"" by Escape Kemah in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-kemah-the-vault,2,"Really fun activity to do, and not too much to spend! The rooms are challenging and really make you think, which really makes it interesting and is a great way to kill some time and bond with strangers. The location is discreet but they have signs that make it easier to find"
