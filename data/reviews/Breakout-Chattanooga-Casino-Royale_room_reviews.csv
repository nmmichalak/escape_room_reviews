"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/Breakout-Chattanooga-Casino-Royale,0,Had fun even though there were only 2 of us. We didn’t get out but the game master helped us till the end.
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/Breakout-Chattanooga-Casino-Royale,1,"We had a great time!  And our Game Master was very helpful. The ONLY criticism I would have is that the Casino scenario (which we picked because of the secret agent intrigue) REALLY needs to list gambling experience as a plus.  If you don't know how to gamble or how the games/bets are played, you are sunk."
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/Breakout-Chattanooga-Casino-Royale,2,Six of us started a birthday evening here and had a blast! Our Game Master Patrick was great and explained to us what to expect. Can't wait to go again!Well worth your time and money⛏
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/Breakout-Chattanooga-Casino-Royale,3,I highly recommend you take friends and/or family and accept the challenge of solving the clues to see if you are intelligent enough to breakout in less than 60 mins.
