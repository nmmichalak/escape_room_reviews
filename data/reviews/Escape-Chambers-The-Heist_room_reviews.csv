"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Heist,1,Great time..had a ton of laughs. It was just the right amount of challenge and our team worked really well together.
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Heist,2,Our family of 6 did this. So much fun. I would definitely do this again. The only downfall is after I left there I thought everything I saw was a clue to something else.

It was challenging, fun and scary. I highly recommend this experience for a pair, or large group."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Heist,5,"What a great and unique experience! One of the fastest hours I have ever spent in a team activity. For my competitive family of four, it helped to be grouped with strangers who also were having their first experience. Even though we came one clue short in the CIA plot, we had a blast, so I would highly recommend going back to try their other scenarios."
"Escape room ""The Heist"" by Escape Chambers in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/Escape-Chambers-The-Heist,6,Our group of six enjoyed themselves. We solved the puzzle but it was a nice challenge. We did Stalk Photo room and I feel like any more than 6 people would have been too many for everyone to feel involved. They will put your group with others but we were lucky that the other group paired with ours did not show. Staff were very fun and friendly. Biggest complaint was it was a sweatbox as we were finishing our final task. They can't control it since the mall controls the heat so dress with light clothing. We had a Groupon so it was half the price which I wouldn't pay full price for it.
