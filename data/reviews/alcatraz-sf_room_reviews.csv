"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,0,This place is amazing! All the puzzles/challenges really fit the Alcatraz theme and the environment is very realistic. A group of 4 (old friends in mid 30s) did this at the weekend. We played the Escape from Alcatraz Escape and LOVED every minute. So much that we booked the Antique game right after and already planning to try the 3rd. Highly recommended and great fun...
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,1,Great planning put into the Alcatraz room! I liked that there wasn't a ton of confusing and excess props used for staging because it's hard to find importance in each clue when only 4/25 matter! Also really liked the electronic aspect of it and the puzzle of thing popping open! Will definitely be back for more adventures with our groupon!
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,2,Just Did the Escape from Alcatraz! We had a blast! I highly recommend doing it! The staff are super friendly and they make the adventure fun. This was a very unique and memorable experience and I am so glad a friend told me about Escape SF!
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,3,This was one of the best family excursions that we've had. We broke up into two groups and did Escape Alcatraz and the Antique Room. You really need to follow the clues and work together to get to the second phase. The staff was extremely friendly and readily available to give hints when stuck. What was nice was the offering of a cold drink since San Francisco was actually hot. We loved it and plan on going again . They are in the process of adding another room so we're ready!
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,4,"Came here with my dad, boyfriend and brother after trying an escape room in San Diego. We were unsuccessful at that place so we were determined to try and escape to one in SF. We tried the Alcatraz room and finished with 18 min left on the clock. Not going to spoil this with hints but all I can tell you is everyone needs to work together and also separately so you have adequate time to complete this. Its part physical and the rest mental. Most of the clues are right in front of you so don't sweat it and overthink too much. Think and act like a prisoner ;)"
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,5,"It was my first time playing the escape games so I didn't really know what to expect! I assume it was a Monk/ Sherlock Homes kinda game. The staff  were very nice & give very clear instructions. We did the Alcatraz one. We managed to escape with 3 mins & 26 seconds left to spare. It was challenging but fun at the same time. Literally THINK outside the BOX!! I highly recommend this game! I can't wait to play more of these escape games in the future. BIG TIP; make sure your teammates are smart. Seriously. The place kinda hard to find because it's not hella obvious where the location is at, but it's across the street from the 1 bus stop next to the sushi restaurant on the corner of Kerney & Sacramento Street."
"Escape room ""Escape From Alcatraz"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/alcatraz-sf,6,Something new and exciting to do with friends! We escaped from Alcatraz with our group of 5 and could not have had a better experience. The rules were clear and the game was well-designed and thought-provoking! We came out SOOO excited and talked about it for days! It will animate you! Give it a try!Close to a ton of restaurants and bars to re-hash your escape techniques over cocktails. We can't wait to come back and do the Antique Room!
