"Escape room ""Time Bomb"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-time-bomb,4,I've done quite a few Escape Games and I am visiting Lexington and decided to give this place a try instead of the same chains we have in Florida. We chose Time Bomb for me and my friend who's never been to an escape room before. Ended up with a great couple going in with us and ultimately ended up one of the best escape rooms I've done!Give this a try and you won't regret it and you can't beat their prices!
