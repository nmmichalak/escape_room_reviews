"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-sherlock,0,"Came here with two of my friends for my birthday and did the Sherlock escape room. It was challenging enough, and we made it out with only 2 minutes left. Keep an eye out for those faulty clues! They can drain your time and some of the clues are as obvious as they seem! Overall had a great time and really want to try out the other rooms."

We will be back to finish that room!! The staff was amazing - both guys we interacted with on Saturday were so friendly and great! The clues were somewhat confusing and didn't seem in order, but I guess that's part of the experience! Highly recommend!!"
