If you are looking for a fun escape room, with a great staff, and reasonably priced?!? Look no more, you found it! I love this place, my only complaint is we finished all of their rooms and have no more to do. MAKE MORE ROOMS! :)"
"Escape room ""Split Personality"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-split-personality,1,First time ever trying an escape room and the kids and I had an absolutely amazing time.  The staff was very friendly (Thanks M!) and were very helpful answering all of our questions.  If you have never gone here before you should definitely go.  It was a very fun and enjoyable experience.  We will definitely be back to try the other rooms out soon!
"Escape room ""Split Personality"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-split-personality,2,"We had a great time at the new Split Personality escape room. This room is for a fairly large group. We had a group of 4 and were matched with another group of 9. The group of 13 was split to start. So 6 in one room and 7 in the other. The groups then work together to solve the puzzle. This seems like a good room for team building events or larger teen birthday parties. This room is also ok for a mixed age group. We solved the various puzzles and escaped. On the way out, the group was very busy and un-attentive. Our two groups finally took pictures ourselves and left. This is the first time that we'd gone on a busy Saturday night and we've had a great experience on entrance and exit the other times. I would definitely recommend, but expect to take your own picture."
