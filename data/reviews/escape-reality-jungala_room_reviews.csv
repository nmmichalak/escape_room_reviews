I've been to other escape rooms, and I have to say that this one was the most fun so far! Super clean, staff is awesome, helpful, and nice. They make the experience fun for anyone who comes in from the beginning. We can't wait to go to more!"

Casey was our guide, and she was AMAZING! She gave us just the right amount of information to get us started, and when we needed assistance, she was SO encouraging about our progress and giving us just a 'little' hint to keep us moving along.We did the Jungala Room, and we just barely made it out before the time was up. Escape Reality exceeded our expectations!"
