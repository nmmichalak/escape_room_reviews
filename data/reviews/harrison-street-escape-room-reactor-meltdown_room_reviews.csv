"Escape room ""Reactor Meltdown"" by Harrison Street Escape Room in Bettendorf",https://worldofescapes.com/bettendorf/quests/harrison-street-escape-room-reactor-meltdown,4,"This was our first escape room experience. Harrison Street definitely didn't disappoint! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We came on our 5 yr anniversary to try something new. It showed we could work as a team, do well under pressure and be locked in a room together and survive lol. Seriously though, we look forward to trying other area escape rooms but this one I will be sure to recommend to others!!"
