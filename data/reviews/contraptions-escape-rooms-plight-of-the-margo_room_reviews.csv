"Escape room ""Plight of the Margo"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-plight-of-the-margo,0,We had sooooo much fun! I’ve done escape rooms all over the world and this was at least 100x cooler and more complex than anything I’ve ever played before.It took them 3.5 years to build it. It was worth every penny and really well planned out. No boring locks and keys like most escape rooms.I booked the room for my son’s 15th bday party. All of his friends couldn’t stop talking about it. The game masters were amazing! I can’t wait to do part 2!
"Escape room ""Plight of the Margo"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-plight-of-the-margo,1,"Plight of the Margo was our favorite escape room ever, even beating the Mission to Mars we did in Pigeon Forge, TN. First, the design was awesome; the thematic content, high-tech set, and multitude of puzzles that could simultaneously engage an entire ""crew"" of a rescue spaceship was superb. There is one place in the set that is not designed for easy walking access (you have to crawl through a hatch/tunnel), but the set is spacious. We had 11 team mates (4-10 is recommended), several of whom were engineers --and who never got bored, by the way; there was good diversity of puzzle types (high-tech, across-the-room collaboration, creative thinking, etc.). We were only able to do the first of two 90-minute (scored) sessions due to our brief stay in the Denver area, but 90 minutes is a good duration for one session in this room. Your team has to manage concurrent puzzle content, because it is extremely easy to lose track of who's doing what, what clues have already been used, etc. Communication is key. Our team of 3 didn't know the other team of 8, but we rapidly melded into a good crew. It was a fully enjoyable and memorable experience. Hats-off to the designer of this room. (You did a marvelous job, even if we did ""cheat"" a little with one of your safety devices. ;-) Darned engineers."

The room was incredibly high tech -- it felt like we were on the deck of the Starship Enterprise in Star Trek!  This is definitely good for large groups; there are plenty of clues to keep everyone occupied.
