We had an absolute blast! The staff was great. They explained everything in detail and also added to the fun.There were seven of us and we chose the Dining Room Caper, which was the most difficult. Bring your thinking cap with you but also your creative mind. Although we didn't escape we had so much fun in the hour!If you are looking for something to do in Fort Wayne, a team bonding activity or just fun for a group this is the place! I will definitely be returning soon."
