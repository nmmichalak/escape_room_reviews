"Escape room ""Vampire"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-vampire,0,"My family and friends have done almost all of the Maze rooms and the Vampire Room is now one of our favorites. It is scary, atmospheric, and features some very unique and clever puzzles. There is excellent use of tech that is smooth, surprising, satisfying, and well-integrated. More than any other escape room we have done, there is a definite cause and effect with things you manipulate. There is good audio and visual confirmation when something is done correctly. Our group produced some genuine squeals, eeks, and a bonafide scream or two. It is not gory, freaky, or bloody and those who are not horror fans should be fine in this room.We escaped with quite a few hints, but I was glad we were able to experience the entire room and all its tricks and treats."

The new Vampire Room was very cool. The theme and immersion was impressive and the puzzles were clever! We took a friend who hadn't played before and he was blown away. I really enjoyed the flow of this game and the difficulty was very high, but we escaped! I really liked how much teamwork was designed into this game, there was always something to do and everyone contributed in a significant way. Loved it!!"
