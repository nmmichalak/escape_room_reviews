We did both Merlin’s room and the Doomsday Bomber and both were great. Employees were all nice and really helpful (we had Daniel and he was awesome). Very impressive technology in the rooms. Not easy, but a lot of fun. We thought the experience was worth the price, especially compared to other escape rooms we’ve done in the past."
