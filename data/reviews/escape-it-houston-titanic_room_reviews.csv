"Escape room ""Escape the Titanic"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston-titanic,0,What a great room! Big with great decor to go with the theme. It was challenging and fun. We did it with a group of 3 and got out with 1:09 to spare.  Definitely a group effort for some parts.  We will be back to do their other rooms!

"Escape room ""Escape the Titanic"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston-titanic,2,"This was a lot of fun.  We barely made it out in 60  minutes, and used all 3 of our hints.  The props and decor looked authentic to the early 1900s, and the sounds and music brought everything to life.  It was a lot of fun.  The ending leaves you in a rush to complete it.  Lots of fun and great for date nights."

We were with another very friendly family and the staff was the same!The puzzles are just the right difficulty and you get a lot of adrenaline towards the end.The quality is very good with modern technology but they give it an old 1912 design and it all looks very detailed.The puzzles really make you think in different ways by using the clues around you and cooperating with your team to get out, I definitely recommend doing this "
