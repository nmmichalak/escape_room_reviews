I've played in both rooms (didn't beat Blitzkrieg but we did beat the Cure) and they're so much fun to try and figure out. The staff is lovely, the games are worth the price, and it's a great time. I highly recommend checking it out!"

There are a variety of puzzles for all skill levels, but the most important part was being able to think creatively and work together. It was a blast! Can't wait to do Blitzkrieg!"
