"Escape room ""Duel at Dusk"" by NM Escape Room in Albuquerque",https://worldofescapes.com/albuquerque/quests/nm-escape-room-duel-at-dusk,0,"We experienced Duel at Dusk on a Saturday afternoon with a group of ladies. We had a ball and our ""guide"" was extremely nice and helpful. Unfortunately, we did not complete the tasks but were very close. This is a great event for families, friends, dates and groups. Something different but fun for all involved. Highly recommend it and the staff is terrific."
