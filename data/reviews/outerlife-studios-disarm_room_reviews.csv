Had a group of 5 at varying levels of experience and it was very exciting.  I highly recommend this event for everyone, but mental maturity is needed to successfully escape."

"Escape room ""Disarm"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-disarm,4,"I've been to escape rooms all around the country -- a lot of them -- and this is the undisputed best them all. There's a danger in giving too much away in describing an escape room, so I'll just say that everything about Outerlife Studios is top notch and innovative. My friends and I were talking about it for days after. The owners were very friendly and deservedly proud of their business. After we were done, they generously showed us the behind the scenes and it was also a ton of fun. We can't wait until they open their next room!"

I came here with my family and it was so interesting to see how we all came together to (almost) disarm a bomb. I've done a lot of escape rooms before, and Outerlife Studios definitely was up there in regards to the riddles and excitement and how much fun we had. Would highly recommend."
