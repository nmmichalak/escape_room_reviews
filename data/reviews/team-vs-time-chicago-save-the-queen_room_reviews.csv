"Escape room ""Save the Queen"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-chicago-save-the-queen,1,I played Save the Queen with two friends today and we had a great time! It was really challenging but doable. They're still working out the kinks since it opened recently so they gave us a little extra time and we ended up figuring it out. The game manager is really passionate about the game and talked to us afterwards about our experience and his vision. We had a really good time and I can't wait to go back and do the other rooms!
"Escape room ""Save the Queen"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-chicago-save-the-queen,2,We went last night and experienced 2 rooms. Both were decked out from floor to ceiling with clues and props fitting of the time periods. The puzzles were challenging but not discouraging at all. If anything the harder they were the more fun we had! Save the Queen was excellent! I can't get over the amount of detail and time that has gone into making these rooms. We'll certainly be back with new friends!
