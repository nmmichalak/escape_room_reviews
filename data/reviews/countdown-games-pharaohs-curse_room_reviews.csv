"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Curse"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-pharaohs-curse,0,My son had a fantastic time today in the Pharoh's Curse Room! Really well run and locally owned business. Such a great idea for birthday parties!
"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Curse"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-pharaohs-curse,1,I've played 3 games here in the last 5 months and have loved every one. Pharoh's Curse is by far my favorite since it feels like an Indiana Jones type tomb. I'm really looking forward to The Castle when it comes out!
"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Curse"" by Countdown Games in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/countdown-games-pharaohs-curse,2,My 4 adult children brought me here as a surprise on my 60th b-day. We did the Pharoh's Curse and had the best time escaping with 6 minutes left on the clock! We are definitely coming back again when we are all together. And I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for adventure!
