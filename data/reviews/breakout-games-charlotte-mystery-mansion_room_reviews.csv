The clues make you think, but aren't so difficult that you're left bored and frustrated. We shared many laughs and felt very accomplished to break out. Perfect group date night experience!"

Our host was Devin (sp?) and he was great! The room we had was the mystery mansion. It was very challenging but you could ask for hints at any time. I recommend this place to people of all ages. We had a great time and will definitely return. Would be great for a date or just to kill an hour at the mall. Well done!
