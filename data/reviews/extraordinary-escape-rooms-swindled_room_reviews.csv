"Escape room ""Swindled"" by Extraordinary Escape Rooms in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/extraordinary-escape-rooms-swindled,0,"This was so much fun!!! We did two rooms. The first was the Dog Napped room, it was a very exciting. The clues were great and it really had us thinking. The second room we did was Swindled. It was a bigger room with a lot more clues to find. A bit more of a challenge but it was no problem because we had more players with us. I would highly recommend going. They just had a new room open up. I will review that one too after we get a chance to do it. All in all a wonderful time, and something to talk about for weeks after. You will have a blast."

I've done many rooms before and I had a blast trying to figure out all the clues in the swindled room! The service was impeccable and I was really pleased with how the clues were incorporated. Thanks so much for having us tonight! Will come back for the Jewel Heist room!

I did the Swindled room with 6 other people. It was a lot of fun and the puzzles were pretty challenging but we did manage to finish it in under an hour. They have 2 other rooms which look really fun as well! The owner, Nikki, is really great and has a true passion this.I would definitely recommend checking out Extraordinary Escape Rooms!"
