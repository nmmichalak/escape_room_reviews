"Escape room ""The Fire"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/doa-room-escape-the-fire,0,Our explorers did the Chicago Fire escape room and we thought it was totally awesome. The other group of explorers did the Basement and they really enjoyed it. This is great for team building.
"Escape room ""The Fire"" by D.O.A. Room Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/doa-room-escape-the-fire,1,I booked a party for my 14 year old son’s Birthday. He had 3 other friends and myself in the “Great Chicago Fire” room. We had the best time. The host that stayed in the room was very sweet and helpful without giving away the answers. Time goes by so fast and I wish we had a little longer. I think the time should be lengthened to 1 1/2 hours. I highly recommend having a party here or just going in for the experience.

Our history, Lauren, was terrific, friendly, and very knowledgeable! The room has a lot of lock riddles, but was so much fun! We had a first time players with us and it was a perfect room for him! This was the third room for us at this D.O.A. location and third time was a charm! We escaped!"

We did the Chicago Fire room because we had our 11-year-old with us and it was great. Challenging but not to a point where we got frustrated. From the very start, our guide Brandon was super nice. We will definitely be back."
