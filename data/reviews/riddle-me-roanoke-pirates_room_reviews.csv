"Escape room ""Pirates!"" by Riddle Me Roanoke in Roanoke",https://worldofescapes.com/roanoke/quests/riddle-me-roanoke-pirates,3,I really enjoyed my time here. We did the Lost Will Room and it was challenging but a lot of fun and you didn't want to give up on it. I loved it. My friends did too. We plan on taking on the Pirate Room next time and seeing how well we do with that!
