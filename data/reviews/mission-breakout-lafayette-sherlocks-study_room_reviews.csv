"Escape room ""Sherlock's Study"" by Mission: Breakout Lafayette in Lafayette (IN)",https://worldofescapes.com/lafayette-in/quests/mission-breakout-lafayette-sherlocks-study,0,We loved it. Went with a group of 4 adults and did Sherlock’s Study! It’s definitely tricky but that’s why we enjoyed it so much. Kept us going and on our toes. The staff was great at explaining everything. We already plan to go back.

We had so much fun even though we didn't ""break out"" of Sherlock's Study (another 5 minutes we would've!), we still had a blast being together. I'd recommend this for families, parties, team-building, etc. I highly recommend and we can't wait to head back! Cheaper than Indy locations too!"

The owner - Eric - was so friendly and professional. I will recommend this place for my friends."

Definitely something new and different to do in Lafayette. The Sherlock Study room was a challenge and I will definitely be back to try the other rooms too. Highly recommend it for everyone and definitely is a great way to build team work and problem solving skills.

We successfully made it out of Sherlock's Study, but it was challenging. This is a great activity for a family or a group of friends. We plan to go back again."

We got a sitter for the kids and went for a date in the Sherlock room. Time FLEW by! We were only about 3 clues away! Next time going to try another room with more friends!
