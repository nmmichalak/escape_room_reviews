"Escape room ""Ghostbusters: Dimension VR"" by The Void Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-void-las-vegas-ghostbusters-dimension,2,So so so good!! My husband did the Star Wars one 1st and he came out with his mind blown. It was his first experience with a VR game. We immediately booked the next game with Ghostbusters. OMG. It was incredible. I loved it. You must go. $35 for 20-30 min. Totally worth it.
