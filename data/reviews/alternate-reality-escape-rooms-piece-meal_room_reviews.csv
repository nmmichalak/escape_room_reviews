The thrill is amazing! It was my first time to an escape room but it was great! The owner and his staff are amazing people who genuinely connected with us to get feed back!

Friendly staff and fair pricing. We went through the scary room piece meal and it was so creepy and fun. The clues were tough but not so hard that they frustrated you. Will definitely come back to try the other rooms.

We laughed, screamed and felt so dumb hahaha. It was the most fun I've had in a long time. The staff was amazing, witty and charming. Our group was 4 girls, all very intelligent however we've decided next time we need to bring some smarter people! The props were fun and scary. The set was interactive and challenging. Great job we will be coming back."
