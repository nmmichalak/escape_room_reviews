"Escape room ""The President’s Bunker"" by The Great Escape Room in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/the-great-escape-room-providence-the-presidents-bunker,1,We had a great time! Our group was paired up with 3 teenage ladies who didn’t seem to mind that they got hooked up with us 40-55 year olds... our combined skills got us out of the Bunker in 55:33 minutes... Justin was an excellent “secret service agent in charge”. We will definitely recommend the experience to friends and come again!
