"Escape room ""The Great Pirate Escape"" by Brainy Actz in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/Brainy-Actz-The-Great-Pirate-Escape,0,"We did the Great Pirate Escape in Temecula. It was a unique and interesting experience. I've never done anything like it before. I definitely think it's a fun group activity and would recommend going with at least 6 people total. It would be perfect for throwing your husband or boyfriend a birthday evening out. The location is great! It's right across the street from Ballast Point. Perfect for grabbing a drink after. The Great Pirate Escape was a neat theme, I don't want to give too much away. I can't wait to try out the Jungle theme."

As my first conquered escape room, I have to say this was the best first experience and would definitely recommend it to anyone. It may be a little pricey, but it's so worth it. It was just me and my boyfriend and it was just absolutely perfect. Must go go go!!"
