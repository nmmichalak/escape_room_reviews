"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/The-Cellar-Key-Quest-F,0,"This is a work in progress, but was good for the price.  The ""serial killer"" theme was well done and the puzzles are as expected for an escape room.  Without spoilers, they include looking for things with black lights, organizing clues, and opening lock boxes using various clues given to you.This is in an empty birthday party room devoted for the escape room experience, and had a creepy vibe, especially given the halloween party decorations that are part of the puzzle.  This location seems geared to kids, although this was slightly too scary and too hard for most children. The organization says that they have been visiting other escape rooms in Orange County, and are tinkering with and changing things here to make it better and better.  It may be worth it to wait a few months until a new experience is announced.  But for the much lower price compared to other escape rooms, this is worth it if you are in the area."
"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/The-Cellar-Key-Quest-F,1,We had such a great time at this Escape room.   We were a group of 9 and we were able to finish the quest in under 45 mins. Yes we did use our hints but we still figured it out. We did the room called 'The Cellar'  and it was really fun. We will be doing it again.
