"Escape room ""Sinking Ship"" by Try'n Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/try-n-escape-sinking-ship,0,Great time with 4 adults and 2 kids 12 and 13. Loved it! We have become escape room junkies and are probably going to need some sort of rehab!
"Escape room ""Sinking Ship"" by Try'n Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/try-n-escape-sinking-ship,1,We had such a great time! We didn't get out. I am writing this from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean where our ship sunk!I brought 5 teenagers and we had a great time. We can't wait to do it again.

We were in separate rooms and had to work together to get to one main room. The only reason that i can't give this a 5 star is because the room wasn't reset completely. Some of the puzzles were already solved so it threw us off because we kept trying to use clues that were already done, but we wouldn't have known. There was more than just one clue that wasn't reset. Overall was a great time."
