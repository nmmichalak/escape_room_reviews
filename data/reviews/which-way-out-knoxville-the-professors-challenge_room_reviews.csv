"Escape room ""The Professor's Challenge"" by Which Way Out Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/which-way-out-knoxville-the-professors-challenge,0,"This is very entertaining for a family or group... or a couple who are willing to pair up and play along with some new friends! Deceptively easy, but extremely challenging puzzles will help you to escape the room. Getting all of the activities completed in your allotted hour is tough, so teamwork is crucial. But with everyone pulling together to decipher, untangle, contemplate, and decode as a group, it is possible! I got to play both of the current puzzles, and found them both a lot of fun. Each room has it's own story line and all of the puzzles fall in line with the story. The price is reasonable and occasionally I have seen discounts on their Facebook page."
"Escape room ""The Professor's Challenge"" by Which Way Out Knoxville in Knoxville",https://worldofescapes.com/knoxville/quests/which-way-out-knoxville-the-professors-challenge,1,"Not 5 stars only because of price. Knoxville Escape game ""Which Way Out"" offered 2 different experiences, we done both. The Professor, and Casino Heist. My family of 2 adults and 2 grown children in their 20's really enjoyed it. Since this is something new to us you just about have to do it once just to see how it works. Tickets are $24 per person, per experience(1 hour). I would not consider this at all with small children.Perfect for older kids, several friends or couples looking for something different. You can have up to 8 per room. I was able to watch for half price deals and get 4 adults for $48 plus tax per room or it would have been over $200 for us to have done both of the rooms. Which is extremely high for our entertainment budget."
