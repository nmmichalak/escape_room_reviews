"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by Red Door Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-fort-worth-time-machine,0,"Wow!!! Just Wow! My family has done escape rooms around the world and the theming and experience of Time Machine was magic! The puzzles are multi-linear, so there was always something for everyone to work on, and the multi-room puzzles required top tier communication. There were many types of puzzles and it took our entire group to get through. Bring your A game to this room! We made it out before we were toast!"
