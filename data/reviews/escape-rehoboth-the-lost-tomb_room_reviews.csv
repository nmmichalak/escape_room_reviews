"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Rehoboth in Rehoboth Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/rehoboth-beach/quests/escape-rehoboth-the-lost-tomb,0,This was my first time doing an escape room and I absolutely loved it! I went with my brother and two nieces and we did The Lost Tomb. The staff was amazing and very helpful! It was such an amazing room and it was fun and challenging at the same time!! We visit Rehoboth every year for vacation and I am already looking forward to next year to try their other rooms!! I definitely recommend it.
"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Rehoboth in Rehoboth Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/rehoboth-beach/quests/escape-rehoboth-the-lost-tomb,1,Our all-ages party of five had a blast in the Egyptian tombs. Really makes you think and work together. Our guide Josh was attentive and gave subtle hints when necessary. Doors pop open and it's so fun! We had about 10 minutes to spare when we escaped! Good for all ages. Highly recommended. I live in the area (now) and definitely taking all my guests to Escape Room in Rehoboth Beach!
