"Escape room ""The Warden's Ruse"" by Cluemaster Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/cluemaster-escape-rooms-the-wardens-ruse,2,"This place was awesome. Even though we failed miserably the staff walked us through the steps as if we would have succeeded.. which was much more fun than going home feeling defeated!! The room we did ""the Warden's Ruse"" had a lot more high tech features than the escape rooms I've done in the past. 10/10 would recommend to others!!"
