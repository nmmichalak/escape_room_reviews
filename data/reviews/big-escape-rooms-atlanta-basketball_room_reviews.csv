"Escape room ""Basketball"" by Big Escape Rooms in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/big-escape-rooms-atlanta-basketball,0,FANTASTIC escape room! We did the basketball room and it’s great for beginners! Josh was a fantastic host! He was very kind and funny! When we were in the room he was very respectful of our efforts and didn’t cut in until we really needed it in order to be respectful! I highly recommend visiting!
