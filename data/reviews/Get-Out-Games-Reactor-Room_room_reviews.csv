"Escape room ""Reactor Meltdown"" by GetOut Games in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/Get-Out-Games-Reactor-Room,0,"I did the Reactor Room with a group of 9 others and we managed to escape after 45 minutes using a number of clues. Overall the room is very well done with nice props and pleasant surprises, some of which I have not seen in any other escape room.While the room is not particularly big it did not feel too crowded even at maximum capacity. Puzzles are highly parallel so there is little downtime. Good balance of dexterity and logic puzzles.A few things for the owner to improve: the string puzzle did not work correctly- time to replace the prop with a new one. A bit more light would be nice. Finally, if you have a giant poster with German text on it, please spend the extra few $$ to have someone translate it properly."

A friend and I were in search of an escape room we called but no one answered. 5 minutes later they returned my call and assured us a slot with a group!!We opted for the Nuclear Reactor game and it as a blast! Very interactive, engaging, and will challenge every single team member.At 30.00 a ticket it seems a little steep but it is oh-so-worth it!!"

We did the heist room and had so much fun that we immediately paid for another room, the nuclear reactor room. All of the clues were challenging enough to stump you for a few minutes, but with enough collaboration, they were solvable. Becca was an awesome host, who didn't help us unless we absolutly needed it and only gave enough of a clue to help us along, leaving the joy of the AHA moments to us. She was super friendly, nice, and accommodating, and did a great job setting up both of the rooms for us. We will definitely be going back to try another room."
