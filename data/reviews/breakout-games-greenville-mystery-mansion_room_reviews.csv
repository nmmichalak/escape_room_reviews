"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Greenville in Greenville",https://worldofescapes.com/greenville/quests/breakout-games-greenville-mystery-mansion,0,"We went to Breakout Games as a spur of the moment decision and we had a wonderful time. We did the mystery mansion room, and wow! It was fun, exciting, and we worked up until the last minute. Our game master was amazing and helpful when we had questions. This room was by far one of the most involved rooms I have done for an escape room and totally worth the money. If you are debating, do this one! It was so much fun and we did this with three people so don't feel like you need a large group to do this!"
