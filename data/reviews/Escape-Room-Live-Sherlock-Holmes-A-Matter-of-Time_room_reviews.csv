We did the Sherlock Holmes room and completed it just in time. We had 9 people, I would recommend 8 or more for this room because it is very difficult with numerous puzzles to solve. Overall very good experience and I highly  recommend."

The space was impressively decorated and very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. The event was fun and extremely interactive for my family. It kept my grandmother and my daughter very engaged along with the rest of us. It didn't hurt that we won as well. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to spend a fun filled hour with friends in old town!
