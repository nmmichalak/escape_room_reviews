"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,0,"The Quest is an excellent fantasy escape room with the perfect combination magic and analogue that ultimately creates an immensely satisfying experience that should not be missed. The set is a wonderfully earthy abode filled with magical odds and ends waiting to be uncovered and utilized, each serving a very realistic magical experience. The puzzles are equally brilliant and have multiple tracks running at once, with enough variety and challenge to keep everyone engaged. The workers, one of which functioning as an in-game and in-character gamemaster, are kind, helpful, and obviously very devoted to the wondrous game they have created. This is not a game to miss if you are in the area."
"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,1,"The Quest is our favorite escape room that we've ever done. The beautiful space feels mostly ""The Hobbit"", but the puzzle-solving made us feel more like Hagrid or Newt Scamander from the Harry Potter world. This was the hardest of the three; I'd recommend trying the others first so you can get to know the minds of the puzzle creators. However, we did this one first and still just made it out, asking for a little more help from the game master than we would have preferred."
"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,2,"We came back to play Escape Goat's newest room, The Quest, which replaced their Sherlock-themed 221B game. I loved all of Escape Goat's previous games, and was sad to see 221B go, but The Quest is absolutely phenomenal. While 221B was a very logic puzzle-based escape room, The Quest is less so. There are still plenty of puzzles to solve, but they're a different kind of puzzle.The scenic in this room is incredible and I can't stop thinking about all of the unique and interesting puzzles. There were plenty of ""AHA!"" moments which can be the most satisfying part of an escape room experience. It's no secret that Escape Goat is one of my favorite escape room businesses of all time."

"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,4,Great staff! The room was booked as a surprise for my birthday and my group of 5 had a blast. The room (the quest) was extremely well done and challenging. Will definitely return!
"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,5,"Loved this authentic escape room! Originally chose it because itâ€™s not a chain and we travel often... We did The Quest since we heard really good reactions from others who had played. Even though we did not make it out in time, we still had a blast and will be recommending to others who are in the area!"
