"Escape room ""The Illusionist"" by Amazing Escape Room in Bridgewater",https://worldofescapes.com/bridgewater/quests/amazing-escape-room-green-brook-the-illusionist,0,I’ve been to a few escape rooms but this one was by far the best. Did the Magicians room for my cousins birthday. The actual room was great but the highlight of the day was our game master Brie. She was awesome and really made our escape room fun by interacting with us the whole time. She gave great clues and even made us laugh the entire time. We’ll be going back just for her. Give that girl a raise!

We initially feared we wouldn't finish the Illusionist but it all worked out in the end. Did mid-afternoon and ended up not sharing the room even though there were only four of us. Just wish the hour of fun didn't cost so much per person, even with the Groupon."
