"Escape room ""Utopia"" by Kuma Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/kuma-escape-utopia,0,"This game is technically the hardest level, with only about 5% success rate. I highly recommend a large party to participate in this stage because there are SO MANY PUZZLES. In terms of creativity, the puzzles are more trial and error, instead of methodical reasoning. Just keep trying, move fast, communicate and LISTEN!"

I've done a different escape room with another company and it was too easy, Kuma was more challenging! Joseph and Sunny were really great ""invisible men"" and we enjoyed our experience more because of them."
