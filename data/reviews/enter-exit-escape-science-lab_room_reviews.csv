"Escape room ""Special Ops: Dirty Money "" by Enter Exit Escape in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/enter-exit-escape-science-lab,0,"We have played over 100 escape rooms and we highly recommend Enter Exit Escape. My husband, 11-year-old son, and I completed the Lab Room. It was a great room for families. Although it is a Gen 1 Room (mostly locks, no tech), it was all puzzle-driven and well-thought out. The setting was immersive and the facility was very clean. The owners are fantastic! Nice to have a local place to recommend to others. We look forward to playing their other rooms!"

For all but one of us, thus was our first escape room experience. The room (the science lab) was a good challenge for the 8 of us - we had children as young as 11 through adults. The staff was very pleasant to work with. All in all it was a very fun evening, and I highly recommend it."

With only one success in the group. Our first time here. And our first win. We did the Science Lab. I'm sure we will be back to try the other rooms. I've been talking it up to my friends."
