"Escape room ""Defenders of the Galaxy"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-defenders-of-the-galaxy,1,We attended the Xscape Pods last night and had a blast.  Three of us did the defenders of the galaxy room and it was Perfect as an intro room since neither of us had ever done any escape rooms.  We will defiantly be back with our hubby's and do the government room.
"Escape room ""Defenders of the Galaxy"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-defenders-of-the-galaxy,2,Our group of 4 did the Defenders of the Galaxy room and we had a great time!  I think 4 players is then perfect amount for this room. The decor was really cool and the puzzles were difficult but not too much so. Will definitely be back to try another room.
