"Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape the Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escape-the-room-denver-jurassic-escape,0,"We enjoyed the Jurassic themed room and while we didn't beat the clock and the room was fairly complicated and non linear in terms of clues, I have to give a hugeeeeeeee shoutout to the staff! We did the escape room with a few friends and our 3 MONTH OLD SON!!!! Yeah, we are crazy. The staff was super accommodating with the stroller, they warned us when there would be loud noises and were kind enough to put a chair in the room so I could feed my son and I didn't have to miss out on the fun!! You guys are amazing!! Thank you!"

They were super excited when we beat the Jurassic room at 6 seconds left on the clock! Super hard room for just 2 people to beat! This was our 3rd time and we love this place!!! Best escape room in Denver!!!
