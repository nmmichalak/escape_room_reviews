"Escape room ""Encore"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-encore,0,"My husband and I visited Escape Effect while on vacation to Orlando and played the Encore room. We have played around 20 escape rooms now and this was by far the best lock-and-key style room we have ever played (& probably my 2nd favorite game we've ever played!). We are typically more attracted to rooms with more technology and effects but the puzzles, decor, and INCREDIBLE ATTENTION TO DETAIL made for an incredible experience. The decor and props made for a fantastic, immersive experience! We were bummed that we didn't have time to play the other rooms, but when we're in town again we will be sure to return!"
"Escape room ""Encore"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-encore,1,Great escape experience! We did the Encore room and it was absolutely beautiful. The details were impressive and the clues hard enough to be just the right amount of effort. The owner was there and SUPER nice too. We'll go back.
"Escape room ""Encore"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-encore,2,The Escape Effect was an excellent escape room experience and this is a recommendation coming from my family and I who are enthusiasts that have completed over 30 escape rooms. The theme and decor of the room we did (Encore) was well-designed and the puzzles were a lot of fun. The establishment is clean and the staff are kind. It is a locally owned mom and pop shop and the quality shows.The Escape Effect can adjust the challenge level of your room if so desired and they offer unlimited hints or none at all...basically they'll do whatever you want/need to ensure you have a great time. We will absolutely be back!
