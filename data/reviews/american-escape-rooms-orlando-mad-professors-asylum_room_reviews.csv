I thought the theming was good, the puzzles were a good mix of thought-provoking but not overly difficult. Had I not done a bunch of escape rooms prior it probably would've been more challenging but it didn't take us the whole hour. The super friendly staff and great theming make it a must do anyways."

Mad Professors Asylum is great and tough! Very well set up! The staff was so fun - great sense of humor and got into their roles to hype up the guest. You guys rock! Highly recommend.
