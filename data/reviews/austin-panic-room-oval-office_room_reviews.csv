"Escape room ""Oval Office"" by Austin Panic Room in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/austin-panic-room-oval-office,0,"I've been to a few panic rooms before and this one was pretty fun!We did the Oval Office Room. The room was well run and clues we properly challenging. We didn't find it too hard or too easy. We had a group of 6 and I think that was a very good number of people.The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because other escape rooms I've been to have been a little bit more sophisticated and more elaborate. But, like with most escape rooms, the group you go with really makes it fun or not fun."

We did the Oval Office challenge, which I understand is one of the more difficult ones. It was very challenging, in a good way. Had a blast; would recommend to everyone!"
