If you don’t have a large group, do the public option, fun time meeting new people in a totally 80's atmosphere. Staff is awesome. Highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Escape the 1980's"" by Steel Owl Room Adventures in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/steel-owl-room-adventures-escape-the-1980s,3,"This was a really fun ladies night outing. Different from the norm. The game was challenging, but it was really fun. Made you really put on your thinking cap. It was awesome to walk into a room and see childhood memories. Also you get cool bonus points for doing things. When a say a great time, I mean that!  The staff was great and very helpful. Much thanks to Sue for helping us out with our tickets! The other staff at the location were great, as well. Looking forward to the additional rooms that will be added around the city. Looking for a fun night....no need to look any further!"

If these things remind you of the good old days, don't walk to Escape The 80's on East Passyunk...RUN!! What a blast from the past! A must try for anyone who remembers the era! No, you don't need to be an 80's child to play, but what a hoot if you are!! We all LOVED it!"
"Escape room ""Escape the 1980's"" by Steel Owl Room Adventures in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/steel-owl-room-adventures-escape-the-1980s,5,After having done 4 other escape attractions it was really nice to see how creative they got when building this room. It is definitely unique and not a cookie cutter copy of some of the other ones in the area. Most of our group were 1st timers and they had just as much fun as we did. Give 'em a shot; you'll have a blast!
"Escape room ""Escape the 1980's"" by Steel Owl Room Adventures in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/steel-owl-room-adventures-escape-the-1980s,6,"I've done a few of these room escapes before and this one was really well done. It wasn't overly complex or difficult but it required team communication skills for sure. The goal of the room designers seemed to be to have the participants have a good time and in that regard, they succeeded.Another thing I liked a lot was how well they implemented the theme of the 80's. There were many references but you didn't need to grow up in the 80's like I did.I don't want to give anything away but there were some really nicely done parts of this room that if you're into the tech side of things you will be impressed as well.Overall, the people here were great and the room was super fun. Give it a try!"
