"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-hostage,0,Me and my work crew went there and at first I thought it was going to be stupid but after we started and then broke out I was very amazed of how awesome this place is .. if you ever have a chance to go you will be satisfied...! I'll definitely be back to break out of the other rooms

As always, I had a great time. While the place may seem unassuming from the outside, the rooms inside obviously have a lot of thought and heart put into them. Each room is very unique and throws me into a new and exciting environment. The clues and riddles are clever and I don't feel like any of them were ever too hard or too easy. The GameMasters were also always willing to help if I did feel stuck! Also, I think I was told that Breakout tries to put in new rooms quarterly? I definitely know they've updated a few times already, both at West Chester and Hyde Park, which is good for customers who want to keep coming back but have already played through all existing rooms. It's always going to be a struggle to compete with so many other escape rooms popping up around the city, but I think Breakout does a pretty good job."

It looks great and plays well. Lots of unique puzzle designs here. Ambiance is not as good as their Mystery Mansion room or by other companies in the area, but it is still better than average. I highly recommend this room overall (7.5/10) and it outshines the other options by this company/location (#2 of their 5 rooms). This is not my favorite company for game design or room design in Cincinnati (that goes to The Escape Game), but it is one of the best."
