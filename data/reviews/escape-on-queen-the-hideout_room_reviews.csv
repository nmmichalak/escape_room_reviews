"Escape room ""The Hideout"" by Escape On Queen in Lancaster",https://worldofescapes.com/lancaster/quests/escape-on-queen-the-hideout,0,"This is the third escape room I've done and, by far, the best. My group and I did ""The Hideout."" It was so much fun that we came back next day and did ""September 1777."" Very clean and inviting. Staff was amazing. Can't wait to visit again!"

Very friendly and accommodating ownership team. We had a blast escaping from the Hideout. Well done and clever puzzles made this an enjoyable night out. Can not wait for the pirate ship to open, that one looks amazing! Very good job to your team!"
