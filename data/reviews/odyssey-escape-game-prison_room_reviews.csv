"Escape room ""Prison Break - Walk the Mile"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-prison,0,Our first time with escape rooms and it could not have been a better experience. We did the Prison Break room. Staff is great and we will definitely be back!
"Escape room ""Prison Break - Walk the Mile"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-prison,1,"Booked our Odyssey Escape Game, Prison Break - Walk the Mile, for our first family escape game adventure. We chose Odyssey Escape Game because all ages can attempt the challenge. Our 6yr old was so excited because he could go!! The team at Odyssey Escape Game are super friendly and made our experience perfect even though we didn't escape. We will be booking our next adventure, Titanic - The Final Hour, in the near future."
"Escape room ""Prison Break - Walk the Mile"" by Odyssey Escape Game in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/odyssey-escape-game-prison,2,"BEAUTIFUL, spot-on, roomy, and immersive rooms, right difficulty, and amazing customer service. Honestly, I'm so happy and tired that I can't think of any more positive adjectives to describe how much I enjoyed the Prison Break room and overall experience here. I will be recommending Odyssey to everyone and also be back to try out all rooms eventually. Thank you for putting obvious thought and effort into your rooms. Odyssey really stands out among the competition. Also, Josh and I think Sydney (sweet girl with glasses!), you two were absolutely wonderful to interact with. Thank you for making our experience so much fun!"
