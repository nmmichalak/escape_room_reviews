"Escape room ""Escape Jack The Ripper"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-jack-the-ripper,0,This was by far the best Escape room I have ever done. The setting is great and it was a true challenge while not being impossible. I felt truly immersed in the experience. 
"Escape room ""Escape Jack The Ripper"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-jack-the-ripper,1,"Fantastic experience! Jack the Ripper is a very polished room with a ""traditional"" escape room vibe but in a very eerie environment. We liked it so much we tried their Prison Room after and it was a blast, but a COMPLETELY different experience. Both rooms are in our top 5. We would have tried Alice (new room!) but we ran out of time and had to head back. but we will come back!!!"

Puzzles were creative and thematic and our game master was a blast. They also have areally nice eerie soundtrack we very much enjoyed and put us in a mood. 5/5!
"Escape room ""Escape Jack The Ripper"" by MindEscape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/mindescape-escape-jack-the-ripper,3,We came back!We have done the esacpe Thai Prison back in October and they had promised to have Jack ready. Now it is available and they have done a brilliant job! We had the same game master from last time and he was fantastic. Good Job MindEscape for a second room well done. Not very scary with a good flow. We wait for the third one!

The facility is clean, game masters are smart and timely with their clues and the room itself is really immersive. We really liked the ambiance, from appearance through the beautiful soundtrack. Jack the Ripper has also a really nice buildup and reveal at the end. My group were paired with another couple but that wasn't an issue at all."

The staff was very accommodating, we just walked in and had the Jack the Ripper room to ourselves which was even better. Great experience overall."

I've done both of their rooms now, loved the new Jack the Ripper theme. The decor is elaborate, the rooms are well put together and the puzzles are the right amount of challenging. The staff is great and the game masters are always available for assistance when needed. Great way to spend an hour with friends and really test your problem solving!"
