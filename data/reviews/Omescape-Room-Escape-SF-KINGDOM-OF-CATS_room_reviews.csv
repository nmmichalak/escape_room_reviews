"Escape room ""Kingdom of Cats"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-KINGDOM-OF-CATS,0,Soooo much fun! Small spaces to crawl through and interesting puzzles. My son and I escaped with 5 minutes to spare..phew! I like the theme of the characteristics of cats throughout the room. Highly recommend!!
"Escape room ""Kingdom of Cats"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-KINGDOM-OF-CATS,1," My boyfriend and I came here with our friends and we had a great time! My boyfriend booked the Cat Kingdom in advance which accommodates 6 people and is the least difficult out of all their rooms. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful as well to get us started.The process starts with everyone watching a video and getting a backstory about the room you enter and also the staff provides you guidelines so you can narrow down your search when looking for clues to help stay within the 1 hr time limit. Cat Kingdom is a great starter for anyone new to escape rooms as this one still gave us quite a bit of difficulty. The room is well designed and you really have to look at everything as a whole.Overall, we're definitely planning on coming back again to experience the rest of the rooms as we had lots of fun. We managed to escape just 1 minute before the time limit so hopefully for our next experience we will finish a bit faster."
