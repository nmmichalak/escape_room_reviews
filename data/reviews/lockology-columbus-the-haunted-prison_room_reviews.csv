"Escape room ""The Haunted Prison"" by Lockology Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/lockology-columbus-the-haunted-prison,0,The Haunted Prison was a challenging and fun experience.

"Escape room ""The Haunted Prison"" by Lockology Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/lockology-columbus-the-haunted-prison,1,Was really unimpressed by this room. Only 2 of the puzzles were challenging. The rest were locks. My group finished the room in 32 minutes and we were really disappointed in the ease. Not worth the cost.
