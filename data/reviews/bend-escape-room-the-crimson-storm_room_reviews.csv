Highly recommend for family fun if you're down for some teamwork. We plan to come back and try another one.

"Escape room ""Grim Stacks"" by Puzzle Effect Bend in Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/bend/quests/bend-escape-room-the-crimson-storm,3,Tons of fun! We did the Crimson Storm room. I think it is more fun playing with a bigger group. Good option for a night out! Definitely makes you use your brain! Staff was excellent as well. They get you hyped up for the game. They are as excited as you are if you win. Had a great time.
