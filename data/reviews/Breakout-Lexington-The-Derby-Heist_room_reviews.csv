"Escape room ""Derby Heist"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/Breakout-Lexington-The-Derby-Heist,0,"This was fun! This was our first adventure, we chose the derby heist. This seemed fitting since the Belmont races were going on. We didn't break out in time but were pretty close. We had 2 out of the 3 items needed. Staff was very friendly and the place was clean. Highly recommended for a small group outing."

No spoilers here, but the room contains multiple surprises and gave us all a challenge. Using local references in the game made it even more fun. Breakout games employee Thomas, helped us a couple of times when we got stuck. What a great staff and a good place to test your wits. You need to give them a try."

My wife and I tried their newest room Mystery Mansion and and Derby Heist. The puzzles were challenging while the game masters still made it fun. Will be back again.

Every time I do one of the puzzle games, I get even more excited to do more of them! My only complaint is that they don't have 10 more already!"
