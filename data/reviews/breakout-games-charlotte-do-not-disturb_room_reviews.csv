"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Charlotte in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/breakout-games-charlotte-do-not-disturb,0,"Just escaped the room, ""Do Not Disturb"" with assistance from the amazing Alex, our Game Master. Despite the fact that we have completed all of their rooms, we WILL be back with more allies, in anticipation of their new room being opened in July. Thank you Alex for all your help, and most importantly, your patience."

My group was able to get out of both rooms, but only with a few mins to spare. I will definitely be back to try out the other rooms!"

We have been to a few so I know that they all are similar concepts but have different styles. The room we tried here was ""Do not Disturb"" modeled after a motel room. I really enjoyed how interactive it was and all the theatrical elements. Also I like the fact that you can have unlimited clues. I would definitely come back here again next time in town and try a different room!"

Our helper guy was super helpful, and there are unlimited clues without penalty, but we tried to limit ourselves to three. We did the hotel-themed escape room, and it was fun and not too hard. We escaped! Lots of different types of puzzles. Definitely would come back!"

My escape room buddies and I have done probably over 15+ escape rooms in the area, and Alex was probably the best game host we've ever had. He really made it fun for us, and of course, the rooms were great as well. We did one then ended up doing another one right after. We can't wait to come back! Thanks!"
