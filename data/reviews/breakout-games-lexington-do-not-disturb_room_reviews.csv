"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/breakout-games-lexington-do-not-disturb,0,In our group of 6 only 1 person had done a escape game before...we decided to do DO NOT DISTURB randomly...just so you know our game master told us when we were done only like 20% win on this on so it's a challenge! But we loved it...we worked as a team and our game master Zach gave us hints when we ask! I don't want to give any details away just know that if your looking for something to do with friends this is a great afternoon trip!

They have a variety of escape rooms to challenge and entertain. My friends and I completed the ""Do Not Disturb"" Room last night and were assisted by Sarah and Sasha as our gamemasters. They walk you through all of the rules and provide hints if your group is especially stuck on a puzzle.You have an hour to complete the challenge, so if you are looking for a team building exercise for your company, a date night out, or a fun time for a group of friends, this makes for a great time. Pair it with one of the restaurants in the immediate vicinity for a fun local evening."

It was just my friend and I, we really worked together. Our game master, Chris was super helpful in guiding us back when we were overthinking a puzzle. I have an itch to do another game now!!"
