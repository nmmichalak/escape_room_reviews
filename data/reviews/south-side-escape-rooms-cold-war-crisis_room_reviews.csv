"Escape room ""Cold War Crisis"" by South Side Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/south-side-escape-rooms-cold-war-crisis,0,"This is the second escape room in which I’ve participated.  The first was lame and formed my initial impression of escape rooms, so it had been years since I chanced a return to another.  And WOW, I am glad I did.  My expectations were exceeded. It’s apparent that a lot of thought and planning were invested to create the scenarios, and unique props and furnishings were used to effectively produce specific experiences.  The sum of all this planning is that THESE ROOMS ARE FUN.The first room we played, Cold War Crisis, was so enjoyable that my party decided to undertake the second and more challenging mission of the Cabin of Dr. Bishop.   What a blast!  And now I learned that a third room will be opening soon; I am eager to solve the next mystery.It’s a refreshing change of pace for having fun.  Highly recommended."

The right combination of challenges and fun to keep all engaged and playing. They offer two rooms to challenge so we will have to try the other one also. We solved the Cold War in 57:23 and made it on the leaderboard.
"Escape room ""Cold War Crisis"" by South Side Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/south-side-escape-rooms-cold-war-crisis,2,Big fan of the Cold War Crisis. Will definitely be back for other rooms. Staff running this place does a great job of helping you just enough to make you earn it but also not make it impossible if you're stuck for too long.
