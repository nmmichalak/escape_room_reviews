"Escape room ""Lost City"" by Escapology Myrtle Beach in Myrtle Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/myrtle-beach/quests/escapology-myrtle-beach-antidote,0,I had an amazing 21st birthday here tonight. Traveled from Cleveland Ohio and by fair best escape room I have been too. Went to Tennessee and Ohio rooms and they all fall short from this one ! We did the antidote we failed but still had a blast. If I ever come back to visit will be good back to check out the other rooms

My husband and I and our three teenage kids really enjoyed ourself. It was clean, a good story line (we did antidote) and we had fun figuring out the clues together. Our game master, Desi, was very helpful and encouraging.  I would definite recommend. A great family night activity!"

The whole building is very clean and the staff is super friendly! We were in the antidote room and the clues were a lot of fun to figure out. We will definitely return when we're back in the area.
