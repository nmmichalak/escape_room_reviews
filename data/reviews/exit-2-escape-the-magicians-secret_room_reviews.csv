The room offered lots of twists and turns and you def need more than two people to play ( or you just need help from the owner)! Can't wait to check out their other rooms.

They were very accommodating and made the event very enjoyable.  The Magician's Secret and Wild West Jail Escape rooms were very unique.  Be prepared for a lot of fun!"
