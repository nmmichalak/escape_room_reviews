"Escape room ""Escape from Alcatraz"" by Locked Up - Mishawaka in South Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/south-bend/quests/locked-up-mishawaka-escape-from-alcatraz,0,The owner was very flexible and helpful with our group. Very clean and professional atmosphere. The Escape from Alcatraz game was challenging but very possible with critical thinking. We escaped with 3 minutes left. Highly recommended for a fun time!
