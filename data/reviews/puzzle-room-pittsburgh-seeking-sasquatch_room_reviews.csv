"Escape room ""Seeking Sasquatch"" by Puzzle Room Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/puzzle-room-pittsburgh-seeking-sasquatch,2,We are escape room operators and huge enthusiasts. We visited Puzzle Room Pittsburgh this past weekend while in town for another event. Of the 60 rooms we have experienced SEEKING SASQUATCH was one of our favorites.  Great story line with a well designed room and props fitting perfectly within it. Excellent puzzles with answers ending in unique results.  In addition it was a clean facility with welcoming staff.  We will be making a trip back soon to try both their 2nd room (The Study) as well as their rumored 3rd which should be opening in the fall.
