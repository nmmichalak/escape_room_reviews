"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Tomb"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-pharaohs-tomb,0,This was one of the best experiences ever! My first time going here. The Pharaoh's Tomb was epic. I honestly didn't know what to expect. Time flew by and it was so much fun. We did escape with just a few minutes left. I definitely will be back to experience the other rooms. It is definitely a team effort to get through. Everyone brought their 'A' game.
"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Tomb"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-pharaohs-tomb,1,I went in last Thursday and played the Pharaoh's Tomb and One Way Ticket. Loved my experience with both rooms. Both rooms had great themes and fun puzzles. Natasha and Natalie were both great as well. Definitely check them out! The location has its own parking lot as well so it's super convenient. Highly recommend.

The room was so well decorated, the game was challenging, but still fun, and the operator was very helpful with clues. We had a great time, and finished with 4 minutes left. It was so much fun! I plan to come back and do other rooms, and would definitely recommend this as a group activity. Very cool!"
