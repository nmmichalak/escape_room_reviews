"Escape room ""Airship Legacy"" by Conundrum Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/conundrum-escapes-airship-legacy,0,We had so much fun at Conundrum. Our group of 8 booked the Airship Legacy and we were pleasantly surprised. The decor of the room was befitting to the Steampunk theme and the puzzles were challenging but our group was successful in escaping the room. We are already planning our next escape room adventure.

This room's theme was unique (steampunk). The puzzles were fun and challenging. The ending was great. The game master was a lot of fun and professional. Loved the debriefing after the room was completed!

They've engineered their rooms with surprises like electronically triggered drawers and interactive games that lead to codes. Worth the price!
