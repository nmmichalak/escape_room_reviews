"Escape room ""The Pearled Pachyderm"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/Phoenix-Puzzle-Room-The-Pearled-Pachyderm,1,"I have been to 3 escape the room-type establishments, and while the other 2 have been good, this one is leagues above the rest. My partner and I did The Pearled Pachyderm. It was just the two of us. The room was set up in such a way that flowed and felt like it made sense, rather than just collecting random letters, numbers and keys. The story, while minimal, made all the puzzle solving feel a little cooler. I liked the hint system as well. We only used one but they gave us a perfect hint that didn't tell us too much but got us out of our mental block. I can't wait to come back and do another!"
"Escape room ""The Pearled Pachyderm"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/Phoenix-Puzzle-Room-The-Pearled-Pachyderm,2,This was amazingly fun! I went with a group of 8 friends and we conquered the Pearled Pachyderm with 11 minutes to spare! I'm happy to say that it was challenging mentally even with 8 adults working on the clues together. If you like problem-solving then this is definitely a must try. Can't wait to go back and do the second room!
