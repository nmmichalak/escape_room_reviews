"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Escape Room Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/escape-room-virginia-beach-detention-hall,0,It was really awesome but harder than expected. I have a whole lot of fun and highly recommend it even though we didn't solve the escape room
"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Escape Room Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/escape-room-virginia-beach-detention-hall,1,Went with my husband and a group of friends last night. So much fun. We solved the room!!! Would definitely go back and try the other rooms.

I was thinking that we were going to be able to escape in 15mins max, as ""most"" of us think quite logically... Well, an hour later the clock stopped, and we were still locked in. I was disappointed with my sleuthing ability this time and will certainly be back to try again. Very cool spot. Joe was very helpful in explaining every detail for us."

We had a great time and got out with 8+ minutes to spare. The clues were challenging enough for our group of puzzle-solvers, but not so challenging as to be unmanageable. One thing I would note: they do allow add-ons if your party is bigger than the recommended number of people, but I would advise against it. We had 12 people in our room meant for 10, and it was too much. We were all tripping over and trying to squeeze around one another. I definitely will be going back."

Super friendly staff and frustratingly fun rooms. Our group did the 2 hardest rooms in one evening and had a blast. Can't wait to get back and do the other rooms!

It was VERY challenging, but we figured it out. I think it would be hard with folks you didn't know. I was glad we were all friends who could work together. Almost all of us contributed in one way or another. We'll definitely be going back to do another room."
