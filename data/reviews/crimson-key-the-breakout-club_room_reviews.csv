"Escape room ""The Breakout Club"" by Crimson Key in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/crimson-key-the-breakout-club,1,"We book The Breakout Club for our work team - two newbies and one person who had only done 3 rooms before. We had a blast!! You could feel the tension at certain points, but it was really fun to see how everything in the room came together in order to escape. It was challenging, fun and Will was great to talk to. We will be back to do the 408 challenge!"
