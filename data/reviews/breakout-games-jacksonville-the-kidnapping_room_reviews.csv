"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-the-kidnapping,3,"This was the second Escape Room I have been in. We did the Kidnapping. I was very impressed. We had so much fun. We went as a group of 5 which seemed like the perfect amount of people for the small room. We felt like we were in a room that was a dungeon with it being dark and handcuffed. the room was fully decorated in the theme, even the floors and ceiling matched the theme. They even made the sounds in the room match the theme. It was scary and exciting. the clues forced us to work together as a team. everyone in my group had something to do, so no one got left out. I personally feel like an escape room should be more than just shoving people in a room with puzzles, they did a great job of making you immersed int he experience."
