"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-hostage,0,This was our first experience at Breakout Games in Jacksonville. Our group of 4 did The Hostage room as part of a Christmas gift.  It was nice that the rooms are private and we could experience it on our own. The whole experience was much more immersive than I would have thought.  We will definitely be returning to try out other rooms. A shout out to Isabelle for her help from start to finish with our escape room experience.

Half of our group did the hostage room where you go in blind folded and are handcuffed to a bench. I won't ruin the rest but that's the one I did and LOVED. Catilyn was our behind the scenes angel that watched us from another room and would would give us a clue if we were stuck but let us use our own brains and didn't give it away. SHE WAS GREAT! The other team did the island something. Sorry I forgot the name but they really enjoyed themselves as well and Daid Josh, their behind the scenes guy was really awesome. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it and can't wait to do it again!"
