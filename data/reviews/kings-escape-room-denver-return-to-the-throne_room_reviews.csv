"Escape room ""Return to the Throne"" by King's Escape Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/kings-escape-room-denver-return-to-the-throne,0,My husband and I attempted to escape from the medieval-themed room. We were unsuccessful but that did not ruin our fun. This room was very well put together and kept us on our toes the entire hour. It gives your brain a good hour of thinking without becoming overwhelmed or frustrated. We can't wait for the other rooms to open!

We did the ""return to the throne"" and ""rock n roll"" rooms. Each room was professionally designed and well thought out. I will go back."
"Escape room ""Return to the Throne"" by King's Escape Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/kings-escape-room-denver-return-to-the-throne,2,"I did my very first escape room at King's. We did Return to the Throne and we actually beat the room with 3 minutes left. It was such a rush! The difficulty level was just right for our group. The hint system worked really well for us (we rang a bell when we needed a hint). The puzzles were varied (some math, some word, some physical). The theme was really cool. I really want to do the Rock n Roll room next!"
"Escape room ""Return to the Throne"" by King's Escape Room Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/kings-escape-room-denver-return-to-the-throne,3,This escape room was awesome! We had so much fun. We loved the Game of Thrones theme. Looked great. Had a really good variety of puzzles with a good level of difficulty. We were able to solve it but did need a few hints. Fabulous!!!!

Going into it, I was so nervous I would get claustrophobic or that it would be way too difficult to solve but I was having so much fun trying to figure everything out that I never even thought about it! My co-workers and I did the Return to the Throne room for a holiday party and I would definitely go back to try their other rooms!"
