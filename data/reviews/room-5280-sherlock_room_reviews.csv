My family does escape rooms in every new state we go to and this one was by far our favorite! It was so great that we went back for the second day in a row!. The guys, In the picture and who run the place, are super friendly and want you to escape. They are helpful and give you help. We would definitely go back when and if In Denver. Thank you both for a great two day!!!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by ROOM 5280 in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/room-5280-sherlock,1,"Very professionally done escape room. Clear instructions and when we got stuck on a particularly obscure clue, a note with a clue was slipped under the door. Lots and lots of locks to figure out how to unlock! You will not leave disappointed."
"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by ROOM 5280 in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/room-5280-sherlock,2,"Awesome atmosphere. The rooms are in a late 19th century building with a lot of original finishes. We did the Sherlock room, which had some unexpected and tricky clues, but was manageable for our group of four. Definitely the best room I've done in the Denver metro area."
