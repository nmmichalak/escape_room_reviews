"Escape room ""The Invitation"" by Conquer the Chamber in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/conquer-the-chamber-cuffs-and-corruption,0,"This is my third time doing an escape room (first time this location). It is interesting how different they all are.I went with a group of 9 and we did the Cuffs & Corruption game. The premise is that one of our group has been framed for an art theft and arrested, so we need to sneak into the FBI and find evidence of corruption to prove our friend's innocence. One person does start out handcuffed until you find the key to free them.The space was a little bit cramped for 9 people. It probably would have been much more comfortable with 7 or fewer.We did escape with a few minutes to spare and only a few hints (they show up on the TV on intervals depending on your progress). I thought the story was a little bit incomplete (since they made such a big deal about the story, it seemed like it should have had more closure to it). We enjoyed the variety of puzzles and how many could be worked on simultaneously, so we could split into groups to tackle things.I would go back to this place again for a different game!"

Perfect level of difficulty. We had to think outside the box and communicate with each other, and we made it out with 25 seconds to spare!"

The FBI room is challenging but so fun! We had the best time and the staff was so nice and accommodating. We'll definitely go back to try the other room!
