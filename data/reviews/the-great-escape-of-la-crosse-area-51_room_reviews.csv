"Escape room ""Area 51"" by The Great Escape of La Crosse in La Crosse",https://worldofescapes.com/la-crosse/quests/the-great-escape-of-la-crosse-area-51,0,A group of 8 of us went here from work for a team building event. Did the Area 51 room. We all had a great time! It was challenging and we certainly needed all 8 of us to get out. The clues they gave us obviously helped tremendously. We got out with only 29 seconds to spare! Great time!
"Escape room ""Area 51"" by The Great Escape of La Crosse in La Crosse",https://worldofescapes.com/la-crosse/quests/the-great-escape-of-la-crosse-area-51,1,A group of eight of us did the Area 51 room as a team-building exercise for work. It was honestly the coolest thing I have done in years. We needed all eight brains to make it out and we escaped!! Staff was so awesome and hints saved us!! I plan on going back!!
