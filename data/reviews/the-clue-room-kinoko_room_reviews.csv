"Escape room ""Kinoko"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-kinoko,1,We had a surprise party for our daughter's 18th birthday and sent her to the Clue Room with all of her friends. They had a fantastic time. Working with the owners to set up the surprise was easy and they were very professional. We have family coming in this summer and can't wait to take them here!
