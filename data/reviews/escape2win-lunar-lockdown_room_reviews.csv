"Escape room ""Lunar Lockdown"" by Escape2Win in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/escape2win-lunar-lockdown,0,I have done quite a few different escape rooms but this one is the most immersive I have ever been in. If you are looking for a room that doesn't have a bunch of padlocks and does not look like your typical escape room full of furniture you will find it here. They literally make you feel as though you are inside a scifi movie on a spaceship with all the electronic bells and whistles. I feel Escape2Win is most certainly hit the mark with room. All of their other rooms are well done and fantastic as well.
