Mission Critical was a good time for both veterans and newbies. The puzzles were interesting and the props were great! Would definitely come back for other rooms!

The theme, story line, and room d√©cor were well done and clues were challenging but not unsolvable. My team escaped with 2 minutes to spare. Bravo on a fun experience!"
