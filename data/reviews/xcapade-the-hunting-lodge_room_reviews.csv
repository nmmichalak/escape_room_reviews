"Escape room ""Hunting Lodge: Wolf Moon Night"" by Xcapade in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/xcapade-the-hunting-lodge,0,"Was very disappointed with this escape room. Despite the wonderful hosts, polite and friendly attitude, the story telling before the room felt rushed and mostly pointless. The room was poorly constructed, offering no immersion into the scenario, the props were lack luster, with many of them being broken or poorly functioning. The puzzles were a madening combination of way to easy, and way to convaluted. The puzzles were often solved out of order, leading to confusion when pointless clues were discovered later. While challenge is to be expected, many aspects were more dumb than challenging, such as a 5 letter combo lock utilizing only 4 letters in the solution, broken props that seem like puzzles, and visual problems that are very counter intuitive. My biggest regret is that I introduced 2 friends to escape rooms here and I can only hope that the poor taste left in their mout from this doesn't stop them from trying others with me in the future."
"Escape room ""Hunting Lodge: Wolf Moon Night"" by Xcapade in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/xcapade-the-hunting-lodge,1,The quality of the room and the props were poorly constructed. The puzzles were convoluted and not satisfying when solved. One lock with 5 digits had to be opened using a 4 digit code. Puzzles could be solved out of order. Our host was patient and pleasant to have.

Really makes you work as a team and think outside the box. The hosts are so friendly and encouraging. We had such a great time, we've already booked to come back and do the second room."

Host were really nice to honour the scoopon price even though we just came there with one extra person.Highly recommended for everyone, I am coming back next week with the kids and I know they will love it"

Maybe a little bit overloaded with information, but it was all very fun and challenging at the same time. I was quite happy with my mathatical skills for the colour box but the rest was tricky and mindbogglingly fun! It was good having 5 people trying to figure it out together. Can't wait to come back and do the second room"

Wonderful friendly staff were very inviting and set the scene well. Our group consisted of 2 adults and 4 children aged 13-17. Everyone got involved and can't wait to come back and do the next room. The puzzles were great and made us think, unfortunately we couldn't beat the fasten time for the room. Thanks so very much for such a great experience."
