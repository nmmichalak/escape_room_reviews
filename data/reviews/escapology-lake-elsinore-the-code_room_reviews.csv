"Escape room ""TH3 C0D3"" by Escapology Lake Elsinore in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/escapology-lake-elsinore-the-code,0,This was so much fun. We had a party of 7 (3 of them were kids 10 and under) and we all enjoyed escaping the CODE room. Some may say it's more for adults but even the little ones had a great time and even solved some of the puzzles. Definitely wanna go back and try all the rooms.

ANTIDOTE AND THE CODE. . I truly enjoyed myself each time. Can't wait to continue playing the games! Beautiful decor, excellent staff, and great overall experience. This is what Elsinore needs! It's new, exciting and challenging! Date night, girls day, corporate team building. . It's perfect for all!"
"Escape room ""TH3 C0D3"" by Escapology Lake Elsinore in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/escapology-lake-elsinore-the-code,2,Just left the code room! It was a lot fun! We are a family of four and had an amazing time. Such friendly and great staff! My kids absolutely loved it as well as my husband and I. It's truly a place for the whole family to enjoy! Everything inside the room was clean which as a mom I always appreciate and look for... nothing sticky or gooey with other people's germs. Thank you escapeology for a great family experience!!!
