This is a MUST play! I've done about 5 escape rooms now, both in Michigan and in Dallas and this was by far the most challenging room I've ever played. It was so much fun and so difficult.The theme of this room takes you back to your childhood. The puzzles were well thought out, constructed beautifully and A BLAST to play.If you only have time to play one of their rooms I would definitely recommend the Treehouse!"

Even I would like to spend time in a room like this. Everything worked and was well designed. Our difficulties (especially with one of the puzzles) were our own skill levels.This room is just fun - the theme sets that up from the start. We had a good time and enjoyed the theme, the puzzles, and the couple that joined us in the challenge."

After being with your whole family in a room for one hour having fun and laughing, I found myself watching the countdown clock to get out :)). Will definitely recommend and go again!!!"
