"Escape room ""The Collector"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-the-collector,0,"My friends wanted to do a girls night here. When you book the room, you have the option of booking it individually for that room. When we arrived, I guess someone else also booked the room, so he joined our girls night. lol. So there was a total of 5 of us. We ended up doing the Collector room. We were definitely advised that it was a very difficult room, which they were definitely right about that. You have to figure out a lot of combinations to open some locks. There is also some math involved, so bring someone who is good at math. I think it was a fun experience, the only thing I didn't like is if you ask for a clue then they take some time off of your clock. I've been to two other Escape rooms and I've never heard of that. They give you pretty good hints, so I don't think you'll need the clues, however we still did. lol. We were able to make it out with 4 minutes to spare!"

It was definitely a challenging one, but it was worth trying to do. I've been to other escape rooms, and this one is a little different when it comes to hints. The first hint will cost you 1 minute, the 2nd one 3 minutes, and the third one 5 minutes. They had a television in the room with the timer, and this particular room had some higher-tech type puzzles. We had a good time there and would definitely go back to try the other rooms. Thanks to the staff for your enthusiasm and professionalism."

We went to other escape rooms as well but this one was our favorite. We tried The Collector. I would definitely recommend going with a bigger group because this was the hardest room! We were the first group to try this room(literally finished the room two minutes before we showed up) and although we did not make it, the two guys running the room were very helpful with guiding us. I would 10/10 recommend this place. They are very accommodating and the staff was super friendly!"
