"Escape room ""Stuck in the 70’s"" by Lost in Lutz Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/lost-in-lutz-stuck-in-the-70s,2,"In our group of four, two of us had done several escape rooms, and for two of us it was our first escape room experience. We all agreed that the 70's was clever with some fun twists; a good balance between challenging yet not overwhelmingly difficult, nor overly easy to figure out. On our way out, we were already discussing when to go back to do the 2nd (more difficult) room. Great fun all around!"
