"Escape room ""The Wizard's Secret"" by Project Escape in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/project-escape-the-wizards-secret,0,Our first time doing one! Boy have they set the bar high for all other ones! We loved the Harry potter theme and all of the special effects! We felt like we were in the movie. We had a blast and look forward to trying the other room out soon! The kids 12 and 8 years old were still talking about the experience way after we completed the room. The owner was great too! Highly recommend to everyone who love puzzles and a fun time to try it out!

This one was the best. I drove 6 hours to try their Harry Potter room and was not disappointed. You don't need to be a HP fan to be able to solve it, but it would add to the enjoyment for sure. Would definitely visit again if I'm Philly. The waiting lounge is the most comfortable too - which I hadn't considered as a value until I visited theirs. Board room table style with board games. Good way to bond with your group before your hour starts."
"Escape room ""The Wizard's Secret"" by Project Escape in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/project-escape-the-wizards-secret,2,So much fun! This was my first time doing any type of escape room. Our group was made up of 3 moms and 4 kids between the ages of 10-12. The staff members who greeted us were welcoming and friendly. They explained all the rules and what to expect up front. We chose the Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban themed room. The room was challenging (I'm pretty sure the kids are smarter than me lol) and engaging for the adults and kids alike. The props and clues are so much fun to discover and you don't necessarily have to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy this activity. I would recommend Project Escape for anyone of any age looking for a unique and interactive group experience. Definitely something I would do again. I'm looking forward to trying another one soon!
