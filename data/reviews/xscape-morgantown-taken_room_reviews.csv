This is a great group outing. The facility is clean, comfortable and trendy. The escape room (Taken) was so cleverly designed and incorporated challenging puzzles. Lots of humor and appropriately placed music made the experience even more entertaining! Our group loved it! Lots of laughs and even some dancing!"
