"Escape room ""Escape the Mad Hatter"" by Ryptic Room Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/ryptic-room-escape-escape-the-mad-hatter,0,"I came here last weekend to do the mad hatter room with some friends I had visiting. A few of us had been to escape rooms before, so we kinda knew the drill! I felt like the puzzles here were hard (but not too hard) and our host was always making sure we were having a good time. I'll be back to try another room soon!"

Our group of 7 loved solving the puzzles in the Mad Hatter escape room- they were all really clever and challenging. Our game master, Ethan was super fun and enhanced the experience. Highly recommend."
