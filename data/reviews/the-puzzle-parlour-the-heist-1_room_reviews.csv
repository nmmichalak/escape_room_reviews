This was such a great room escape - very immersive, challenging but not impossible, and so cool! This was seriously a high-quality adventure. Highly recommend this if you are looking for an amazing room escape experience. Can’t wait until they have more experiences to try!"
"Escape room ""The Heist Part 1"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-the-heist-1,2,It was our first time doing an escape room and we chose the Heist. We went for my 40th birthday and decided to dress in all black to go with the theme of the escape room. It made us use our brain lol but must of all we worked together as a team. The staff was excellent! The location was easy to find. I definitely recommend EVERYONE to go and enjoy the experience!

We did the Heist and the puzzles were just hard enough to make it fun but not impossible feeling. Our was very attentive. Their clue detail and guidance really made it a great experience. I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as we did. My wife has been to an escape room in NJ and wasn't impressed but loved this. Luckily we're local and we're going to go back for their other rooms."
