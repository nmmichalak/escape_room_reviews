"Escape room ""Superhero Training Facility"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-superhero,3,Our family went for my adult son's birthday. We did the Super Hero room. It was a whole lot of fun and very challenging. It took me back to the days when my sons were little super heroes. We really worked together as a team trying to escape. Teamwork t makes for a very happy family. We were so close to escaping. Everyone had a great time and are already talking about doing it again soon.
