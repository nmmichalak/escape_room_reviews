"Escape room ""Pirate Bay"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-pirate-bay,1,I went to the pirate room on Thursday night with my boyfriend and some of our friends. Absolutely loved it! The theme was fantastic and well done. We love going to these rooms and this was my favorite theme by far. Great puzzles too! Really fun technology. It's a must go if you're ready to escape a (fictional) pirate gang who's going to murder you if you cannot escape their lair within the hour!
