There were enough clues to keep us going and we never felt stuck, plus the theme was great. This was a fun birthday party for my geeky 11-year-old."

I would definitely recommend going. I think a smaller group is better. We had 6 people and that was perfect."

Of 3 escape room experiences (2 in other places), this one was the best. Tippecanoe place and its history were a fantastic setting. The clues were challenging but not impossible. The staff offered great hospitality. We'll definitely return for another adventure!!!"
