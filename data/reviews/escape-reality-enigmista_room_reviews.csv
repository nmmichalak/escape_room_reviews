"Escape room ""Enigmista"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-enigmista,0,"I've been to another escape place, but this one is coming in first. We did the Enigmista room and it wasn't easy. It's crazy how the mind works. You can look at the same thing over and over and see one thing, then someone else in the room looks and sees something completely different. I like the challenge though! I loved that this went room to room with changing scenarios and challenges. The other escape place had one room, so this was exciting. I will for sure come back here!"

Went to do Enigmista the first time and Nadine was a great host. Went 2 days later and did Down the Rabbit Hole which was challenging, but fun! Finished both with good times and had blast. Would definitely recommend!"

We were running late due to traffic but the staff was so friendly and understanding. We picked the Enigmista Escape room because we love horror.I won't give anything away, but the clues were just difficult enough to be challenging but fun. We only had to break down and ask for a clue once in the last part of the game. It was just the two of us so perhaps bring a total of 3/4 people to help out, but only if you work well together.We were exactly one minute over the 60 minute, but we made it out! I like that Cheyenne allowed us to finish because she could hear us getting the last clue when time ran out.We will definitely be returning next year!"
