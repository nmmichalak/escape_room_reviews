The room we did was Enchanted Kingdom. We found all of the jewels but ran out of time before we got the code to get out.

We had a great time! We've been to several different escape rooms in the past, and even one in Durham but feel that Bull City was by far superior. We completed Enchanted Kingdom, and had 5 folks in our group. There was rarely a moment that felt boring, and there was enough variety that everyone in our group was busy at all times. Will was our Gamemaster and did a great job being available for hints if we wanted (we only used one) and offered a few guiding tidbits as we played. Highly recommend!"

Yesterday was my husband and my 12 wedding anniversary and we did the Enchanted Kingdom. It was so beautiful and creative! There were so many moments when I was just in awe of the intricacies of the puzzles! We also had the room to ourselves which made it extra special AND, when we walked in, there was a sign right at the Entrance wishing us a Happy Anniversary! So kind! We will absolutely be back!!!"
