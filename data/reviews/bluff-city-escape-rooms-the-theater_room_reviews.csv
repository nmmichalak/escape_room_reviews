"Escape room ""Theater"" by Bluff City Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/bluff-city-escape-rooms-the-theater,0,I went here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and had an absolute blast! We did the Theatre room and loved it. The staff was very polite and accommodating to us sneaking in close to closing time on a Sunday afternoon. This would be a fun and entertaining thing to do for just about anyone and I can't recommend it enough. Looking forward to returning to do more rooms!

Very creative and the best ""decorated"" room we've seen in escape rooms! The owners are very friendly and helpful. Many thanks for a great experience! We wish you much success, and we will be back!"
