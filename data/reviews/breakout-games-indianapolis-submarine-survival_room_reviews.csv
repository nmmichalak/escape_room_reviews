"Escape room ""Submarine Survival"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-submarine-survival,1,"We have now completed all of the rooms at the casselton location, including the newest, submarine survival. Teddy, the manager, was our game master for 2 of our games. Not only is he a top notch game master, he is a great guy. Very personable, awesome at what he does. He reads the customer, knows how much to help, spends time chatting after the game, and is genuinely excited for you. Breakout is the only place that promises private rooms. We absolutley loved every room. I give breakout games the absolutely highest recommended I can give."
