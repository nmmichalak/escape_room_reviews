"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,0,"This review comes from a group that has completed about 20 escape rooms across the nation, including in cities such as Orlando, St. Louis, Las Vegas. We have encountered some so-so rooms, some decent rooms, and some amazing rooms. What we LOVE - They don’t mix you with strangers in the rooms! That is awesome! This room, the Zombie Lab, was a little bit of a disappointment for us. We had previously done, over several years, both the Bank Heist and the Western room at this venue. The western themed room has the best theming of them all, as it is the most immersive, though even there you’ll see odds and ends that appear to be incomplete, like a certain ceiling tile installation/work-around that looks sloppy.  First off - TONS of locks. Locks, locks, locks! That is typical of many entry-level rooms. The puzzles ARE fun, but not many of the puzzles relate to the stories! It seems like the rooms are decorated, and then filled with a hodgepodge of random puzzles that don’t actually contribute to the theme or the story. You’re walking around thinking, “How is this puzzle related to the story at all?”  Another aspect that is a bit of a letdown: Having to watch an intro video in the lobby in front of other groups. It’s just awkward standing around a television next to the counter to watch a poorly written (and full of grammatical errors and misspellings!) video before entering the room. Lastly, it would be nice if the employees conveyed some enthusiasm for the job at hand. The instruction segment given to each group by the employee is too long and rushed. It’s a LOT of talking for them, and they talk fast to get through it, which is just annoying for everybody. The instructions should be more concise. Our favorite to least favorite room at his ensue: #1 Wild West (We were told the owners built this one themselves - They’ve obviously learned a lot from running the other two rooms) #2 The Bank Robbery #3 Zombie Lab "

"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,2,Thank you so much. We had such a good time. The owners really set us up to have the best experience possible. It made my weekend to save the world from Zombies with my smart friends. Your welcome world! I called my buddy who has an events group on my way back to town from Phoenix to tell them have your groups drive 2 hours to this one. Its worth it. Awesome!

We did the zombie lab and it was everything we wanted it to be! My favorite part was all of the special effects... it was really immersive! We can't wait to go back to do the Bank Robbery room! Thanks for an epic experience!
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,4,"The most immersive and thrilling experience in town! I have competed in both the rooms (escaped successfully once) and in both cases had an amazing time that I am still talking about with my friends. Cannot recommend enough, whether it be with friends, family, or co-workers, you will love it!"
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,5,"As someone who has done multiple ""Escape the rooms"" before, this was the most dynamic and exciting one I've done so far! We did the ""find the zombie cure"" one and it had so many exciting and interesting aspects that it kept us all on our feet. I can't recommend this place highly enough! It's the most fun when you go with everyone you know so make sure you bring five other people!"
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,6,"I've never done an escape room before so when my sister and I saw it pop up on Facebook we immediately wanted to do it. We booked 6 people for the Zombie Lab and completed it today at noon and finished the room with 14:15 left! It was very fun, had us working together and the puzzles were great. Definitely want to go back already and try the bank heist room, this place was great! It's even cuter because it's ran by a Husband and his Wife, they were extremely nice."
