"Escape room ""Clue Me In!"" by NWA Escape Room in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/nwa-escape-room-clue-me-in,0,"Honest to goodness this was so fun! We did the Clue one as a family and it was perfect! Just tough enough to make us think, but we were still able to solve it! (We are a detective type family though). I would seriously recommend this place to anyone!!! It's perfect for all occasions. Thank you so much NWA Escape Rooms!"

But not so hard that it's frustrating. Staff was great. We did the Clue room and loved it. The room was made for 8 people, but just 4 in our group were getting in each others way, so I'm glad it was just us. Would have been a little claustrophobic with 8! Will definitely be going back."

He picked the characters for us and from what we heard from our other group members, pinned all of our personalities down! We had a great time and will definitely be back for more adventures!"
