"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,0,"This was a great experience! We did this as a couples date and had a blast. It got pretty intense at the end. The staff were very friendly and shared information on the facility. The room we escaped from is not for the faint of heart. If anyone suffers from anxiety, you may want to reconsider the room we did ""Escape your nightmare"". Still wondering how my picture ended up on the wall..."
"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,1,"Very fun, well put together with great theming. We did the serial killer room with 3 people and it was a blast. With the looming threat of a serial killer barging into the room made for a very tense and exciting situation. I might not take people who are easily scared as the theme of the room is quite ""obvious"" (fake body parts etc.). Very much would recommend however. And looking forward to trying their other rooms."
"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,2,"First time going to an escape room. We tried the ""Escape your nightmares"" room. This was a multiple room challenge with an hour timer before the serial killer comes home and adds you to his collection. We had a great time looking for clues, finding the keys to unlock boxes and doors before time ran out.The staff was very friendly and helpful. We have to try their other rooms! We will be back."
"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,3,Our group of 6 had so much fun tonight! The room was really well made and thought out. Definitely Challenging but we had an awesome time! Would totally go back to try another room.
"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,4,"Did the ""Nightmare"" room as my first one. Me and 3 friends. Very cool setup - subtle enough that 4 30 year old+ people probably overthought the clues but straightforward enough that anyone could figure them out. That's to say it was nicely done. Easy to use the website, check in was easy, and the props were simple, if subtle for a ""Nightmare"" scenario.Will try a couple more escape rooms, but also want to come back here and try another room at least. ""Nightmare"" is their easy one and we still needed a lot of hints (hence my comment about my group likely overthinking it a bit)."
