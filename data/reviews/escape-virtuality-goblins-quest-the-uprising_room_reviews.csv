"Escape room ""Goblins Quest: The Uprising VR"" by Escape Virtuality in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-virtuality-goblins-quest-the-uprising,0,"Escape Virtuality is the most fun I have had all year! The games absolutely feel real; you feel the movement, the adrenaline rush, and even the air (in some of them). Michael, Neil & Igor were all extremely helpful in explaining each game and guiding us to experiences we would enjoy. The highlights for me were:1) Nearly all the games can be played individually or in multiples (up to 16 people for one of the games) so you can go alone or in a group of as few or as many people as you want! 2) Everyone there knows A TON about each of the games, and can help you find something that will be fun based on your interests and skill level3) They do their best to adapt the games to each person's skill level and will stick around to help you if you get stuck 4) It feels so real! I had never done anything like this before and I'm blown away by how real it looks and feels5) They have something for all age groups so you really can go with kids, friends, coworkers, everyone6) The escape rooms are UNBELIEVABLE!!!! I won't spoil it but you will definitely want to book them for your next team building event All in all this is a great new experience in the city, great prices and a ton of fun!"
