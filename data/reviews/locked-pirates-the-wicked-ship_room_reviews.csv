"Escape room ""Pirates - The Wicked Ship"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-pirates-the-wicked-ship,0,Good for people new to room escape but a little easy for people who are more experienced. Rooms have a ok mix of standard locks and more innovative puzzle mechanics. We did pirates room and spooky room. We finished both with 25-15 minutes to spare. There didn't seem like enough space for the group in pirate room.
"Escape room ""Pirates - The Wicked Ship"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-pirates-the-wicked-ship,1,"This was such an amazing room, with a lot of cool props and a lot of exercises where you needed to work as a team, in ways we've never experienced in a escape room before. The good thing about these rooms, they get you thinking even after you're done. You kind of get an ""AHA!""-feeling, realizing why it's arranged as such. "
"Escape room ""Pirates - The Wicked Ship"" by LOCKED in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/locked-pirates-the-wicked-ship,2,Some friends of ours had told us that this is a great Escape the Room so we decided to check it out! Itâ€™s a tad bit pricey but well worth it! We did the pirate room and it was well thought out and exciting but we were able to get through! Would definitely recommend for a night out with friends!
