"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/prison-la,6,RoomEscape is the industry standard of what escape rooms should aspire to be. Very clean cut puzzles with great implementations of technology. I have done all 4 of their rooms and each has a well thought out combination of puzzles to make their games interesting for a variety of group sizes. Their themes are excellent choices and provide a new experience with each room. Would highly recommend.
