"Escape room ""Y2K"" by Breakout KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/breakout-kc-y2k,0,"We've done rooms at both Breakout KC locations, and they are such great escape rooms! My favorite so far has been the Y2K room at the new Park Place location in Leawood. It is a super fun room with lots of cool puzzles to figure out. The staff at both locations are really friendly, attentive and helpful with clues if you want them. I can't wait to try their additional rooms!"
