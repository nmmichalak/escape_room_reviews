"Escape room ""Caskwerks & Capone"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-caskwerks-and-capone,2,"I did Caskworks and Capone with a friend. It was my first time only having two people solving the clues. It was fun and I really enjoyed the set up of the room. It looked like a speakeasy. I think we would have solved faster with one more person but we made it out with 19 seconds to spare! The hints are good and we didn't need to use any clues, which cost time. This one was also cool because you start in a dark room and have to figure out how to turn on the lights! Not totally dark, but you definitely need to get the lights figured out first."
