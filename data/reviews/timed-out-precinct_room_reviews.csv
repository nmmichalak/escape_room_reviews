"Escape room ""Precinct"" by Timed Out in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/timed-out-precinct,1,We LOVED Timed Out Escape! The Illusionist room (not listed on this website) was mysterious and had plenty of clues to solve to keep our large group busy. Shoutout to CHRIS who had a clever way of giving clues and extended our time by a few minutes to ensure we could have the best time possible. Would definitely come back again.

The room we did (Precinct) was challenging, fun and great for our group. It was all very creative and interesting and I'd definitely recommend Timed Out for groups of friends and families. Timed Out is the best escape room experience in Charlotte!! We'll be back to take on another room soon!"
