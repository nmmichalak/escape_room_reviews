"Escape room ""Deuces Wild"" by Frisco Escape Room in Breckenridge",https://worldofescapes.com/breckenridge/quests/frisco-escape-room-deuces-wild,0,My husband and I did the Deuces Wild room by ourselves and finished with 2:20 to spare. This was so engaging and so much fun. We both got things the other didn't and worked together on nearly everything. Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzles and is looking for something different!

Great immersive room design for the theme. Enjoyed that the puzzles were challenging, but not illogical. Plus some clever mechanisms and executions that were fun reveals when you discovered them. Glad we chose to do this on our rainy day!"
"Escape room ""Deuces Wild"" by Frisco Escape Room in Breckenridge",https://worldofescapes.com/breckenridge/quests/frisco-escape-room-deuces-wild,2,A couple of my co-workers and I have never done an escape room before so this was our first experience. We had so much fun it should have been illegal! I cannot recommend this place higher. We played Deuces Wild and cannot wait to try more of the rooms Frisco Escape Room has to offer.
