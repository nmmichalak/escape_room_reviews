Great storyline, fun puzzles. We were especially impressed by the service. Frank, the manager, helped us change our room when another group booked with us. He made sure we had a personalized experience (we’re very particular about not having another group join our team!). Frank also showed us previews of some of the other rooms and told us some of the location’s history. He went above and beyond to give us a fun visit, from start of booking to escaping the room! Thanks to the whole team. I would definitely drive the hour again to escape another room here!"
"Escape room ""7 Deadly Sins"" by Escapology Orland Park in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapology-orland-park-7-deadly-sins,2,We had a great time. The attention to detail is amazing and our game master Thomas was fantastic! We can't wait to go back and try another room. We have gone to other escape rooms and Escapology is by far the best.
