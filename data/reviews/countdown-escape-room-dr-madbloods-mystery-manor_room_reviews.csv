I was sure the room would be great as all there rooms are great for decor and puzzles, but the bar was raised with this room. We have done over 40 rooms and this was my favorite!"

We've done over 60 rooms now and thoroughly enjoyed the ones here. The Titanic Room and Dr. Madblood's Mystery Manor were challenging but a lot of fun! The quality of the room design was high and had good flow, and there were unique challenges, puzzles and technology in the rooms. One of the owners ran our game and he was great - he knew just the right moments to help our team out. We escaped both rooms and will definitely be back to try the other rooms!"

The decor, the clues, and the staff are all top notch. I've been with family and with co-workers - this is a great activity for any group! We did the Dr. Madblood room today and loved it!"
