"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-operation-casino,0,"I have completed 8 escape rooms to-date and Casino is probably my favorite one. My wife and I barely escaped with under a minute left. This room represents the perfect blend of theme, puzzles, and other challenges. Truly a great room!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-operation-casino,1,Yay! I'm a fan. The Casino escape was really fun and challenging. Everyone had a fantastic time and used brain cells we hadn't used in a while AND we were able to break out with a little over 2 minutes to spare. Dexter was a wonderful game master.

The room had legit props and a cool story line. It was pretty tough and we did ask for clues, but we got out with 6 seconds to spare! It was warm in there so I recommend light clothes. I would definitely try another one of their rooms. Worth the money for an hour of fun!"

We booked 6 of the 8 spots avail for the Casino room as a birthday celebration activity. The other 2 spots quickly filled up and we made some new friends. We were concerned that the decorations would be too cheesy, but this was legit with gaming tables, rules, poker chips, etc.  The staff was great. We are excited to go back and try another room!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-operation-casino,4,Came as part of a team building event for work. We did the Casino game and I thought it was pretty challenging.  We did make it out with 13 seconds to spare.  I really didn't think we would get out with about 4 minutes to go and seeing how many clues we still had to go.  The game master was a big help but didn't really give away any of the clues.  Just enough to get us looking in the right spots.  Would certainly like to come back and try one of the other games sometime.
