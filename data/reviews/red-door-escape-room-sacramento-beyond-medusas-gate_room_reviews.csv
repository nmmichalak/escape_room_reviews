"Escape room ""Beyond Medusa's Gate VR"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-beyond-medusas-gate,0,"Red Door was a ton of fun! We went for our second escape room there and ended up doing a VR experience this time around. Medusa's gate was one of the COOLEST experiences I've ever been in. Mary was the one that helped us get started and she was the sweetest person ever. So helpful during the game as well. After the fact, Kevin was able to help us wrap up and was super enthusiastic as well. Glad I'm a part of their loyalty program. :)"
