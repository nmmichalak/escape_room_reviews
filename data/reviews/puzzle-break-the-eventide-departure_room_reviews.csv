"Escape room ""The Eventide Departure"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-the-eventide-departure,0,"I was in a team of 8 people who split into two teams and did Eventide Departure in competition mode. There are indicators in each room that show your team's progress and the progress of the team in the other room. This extra level of competition made the game even more fun.I've done over 40 escape rooms and Eventide Departure is amongst my favourites. It's a bit ""out of the box"" -- they'll ask you to ""just go with it"", which is good advice. The room design is excellent (which might not be obvious at first), with lots of mechanisms the control the room. As an experienced team, we just got out in time, so less-experienced players will require some hints."

This was our first time doing an escape room, and it was a ton of fun, with great puzzles and awesome ambiance. I also really loved the hint system, which helped us from getting stuck going down a dead end path. Highly recommended!"

We all had an amazing time, and we're actually able to solve the game with a few gentle nudges from the staff!The staff were all super friendly, the setup and effects were really cool, and the atmosphere was creepy without being scary. Erica, the general manager, was super sweet and described some of the tricks they used at the very end and took our photo in the room to commemorate the night. Definitely going back with friends and family!"
