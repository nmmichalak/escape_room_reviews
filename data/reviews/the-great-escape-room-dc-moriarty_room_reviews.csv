"Escape room ""Professor Moriarty’s Gameroom"" by The Great Escape Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/the-great-escape-room-dc-moriarty,1, I came here for a friend's birthday and I loved the experience. We did the Gameroom and had someone who worked at the facility in the room with us as we solved the clues. There were 5-6  games we had to solve in order to escape the room. It was laid out pretty clearly but felt on the of clues were not really a clue that helped - it confused us even more. All in all we were able to escape with 6 mins left - so a success nonetheless.
