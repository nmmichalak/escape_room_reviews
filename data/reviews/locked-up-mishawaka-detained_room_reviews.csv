"Escape room ""Detained (PsyOps)"" by Locked Up - Mishawaka in South Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/south-bend/quests/locked-up-mishawaka-detained,1,"Came here last night to escape finals at school. We called not expecting to get in, but they were more than accommodating for us. We got there and we're treated like friends. We did Detained. It was very difficult, but we almost finished it, getting to the last clue. You have to hurry but you have to slow down and think or you will miss clues. We will definitely be back!!"
