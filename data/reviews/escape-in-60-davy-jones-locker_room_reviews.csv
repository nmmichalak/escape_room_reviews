Our first escape room ever and it was fun for the whole family. We are all very competitive so we pretty much had to get it together to finally escape in 48 minutes!Our ages ranged from adult to teens to a 6-year-old (which by the way helped around a clue).

It was simple to just walk-in, book the next available room and start. We did the Pirate room with us 2.5 and another 2 strangers, which we finished with 10+ minutes to spare! It was loads of fun. The question/answer system was easy, and the people working there were really nice!"
