The room we did - Ex Machina - was pretty dense with them. Definitely a fun challenge and I'll definitely be back!If you're on the fence about going, I say take the plunge "

We've played over 70 escape rooms and we really like this one! We think this is currently the best one in Baltimore. There were some great custom puzzles that were fun and interesting, but the decor was a little uneven. We definitely recommend this room! Great, friendly staff too! Thanks!"
"Escape room ""Ex Machina"" by Baltimaze Escape Rooms in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/baltimaze-escape-rooms-ex-machina,2,This was my first escape room experience and thanks to the wonderful staff at Baltimaze I'm hooked. We escaped Ex Machina which was well themed and challenging for everyone involved. This was not a game that only required one skill set and I found myself really involved in the challenges and how they fit together rather then focused on how much time we had left. Everyone had tons of fun and we were already discussing a return trip before we left the building.
