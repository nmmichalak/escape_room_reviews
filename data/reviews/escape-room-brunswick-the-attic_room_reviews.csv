"Escape room ""The Attic"" by Escape Room Brunswick in Brunswick",https://worldofescapes.com/brunswick/quests/escape-room-brunswick-the-attic,0,We did all three rooms in one go. All the rooms were very different and fun. I’d recommend smaller groups of 5-6 for the rooms but there is something for everyone. Each room had its own story and unique puzzles. The Cabin was definitely my favorite. If you’re in the area or an escape room junkie you should check this place out.
