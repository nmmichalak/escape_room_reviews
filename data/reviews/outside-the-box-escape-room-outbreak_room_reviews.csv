A perfect pre-dinner activity. The design was well-done and I'd definitely go back and try some of the other rooms. Great staff!

We had two young ladies join us for the hour. Although, we didn't make it out, it was so much fun. So many clues to follow, and the best part is not knowing where to start!!! Can't wait to try the other games."
