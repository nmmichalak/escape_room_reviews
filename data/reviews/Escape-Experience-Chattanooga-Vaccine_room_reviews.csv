"Escape room ""Vaccine"" by Escape Experience Chattanooga in Chattanooga",https://worldofescapes.com/chattanooga/quests/Escape-Experience-Chattanooga-Vaccine,0,My husband and I did the Vaccine room on a recent trip to Chattanooga. It was so much fun! There were many clever puzzles that we hadn't encountered in escape rooms elsewhere. We had a great time and were definitely challenged. I'm so glad we did it.
