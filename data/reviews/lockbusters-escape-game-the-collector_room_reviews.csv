"Escape room ""The Collector"" by Lockbusters Escape Game in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/lockbusters-escape-game-the-collector,0,A great night with the Collector! It was definitely challenging but also so much fun! We will definitely be coming back soon!
"Escape room ""The Collector"" by Lockbusters Escape Game in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/lockbusters-escape-game-the-collector,1,"Loved it! Went here with my mom, her friend, and my boyfriend. Itâ€™s very clean inside, the decor was cool and steampunk-looking to me. The rooms were set up down a hall and you choose which room setup to go into. We went into the Collector's room and once you start your hour time, your blood just starts pumping! The items were in very good hiding spots and I loved our host who can give you clues whenever you ask. They were very nice and polite and it was a lot of family fun!"

The Collector was creepy and entertaining. The staff is engaging and our Game Master Cipriano was the best part of the whole experience! Can't wait for our next room.

Our group of five conquered both ""The Collector"" and ""Pirate Adventure"" and all I can say is ""WOW!"" The rooms are spectacular and so beautifully detailed. We cannot wait to come back and tackle the new rooms!"

From the moment we walked in, it was amazing. The staff is extremely helpful and absolutely passionate about their work. We did the Collector room, and the set design makes you feel like you are really in a serial killer's basement. I am officially hooked."
