We just did The Legend of Atlantis! You have to do it! My husband and I decided it would be a fun family Easter event. The staff was wonderful and assisted us with putting our kids Easter baskets at the end for them to find! The 4 of us finished with 34 seconds left! They were completely surprised! We had so much fun! We can't wait to do the Christmas one!

And we got just the right amount of help when we used our clues. Pleased to say we made it out, but just barely in time! Can't wait to try another one!"

This escape room is different because there are no wasted details. Everything is meant to be used. The technical aspect is wonderful as well. Most escape rooms are all combination locks and keys. Backstage escape has puzzles that do more than tell you the number order, actually unlocking hidden doors upon completion. Overall a great experience."
