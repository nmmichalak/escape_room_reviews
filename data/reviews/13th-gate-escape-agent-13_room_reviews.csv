"Escape room ""Agent 13"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-gate-escape-agent-13,0,"13th Gate still has the highest production value of any escape room establishment I've been to. We've done a total of three 13th Gate rooms, the latest being Agent 13. Like the others, the Agent 13 room is fantastic in terms of scale and scope. The equipment tends to be top-notch, save for one moment in the narrative where the equipment malfunctioned and cost us valuable time.My group currently holds an unimpressive 0-3 record at 13th Gate. We've done escape rooms all over the country, and we tend to succeed, but the 13th Gate people seem to pride themselves on narrative difficulty. Many of the puzzles are fresh and engaging, but we have found that some of them risk becoming just a little bit too obscure. The line between ""clever"" and ""arbitrary"" starts to blur from time to time. At any rate, the staff are very professional, the rooms are very ambitious, and these are still the most exciting escape rooms we've experienced. Definitely give them a try."

Absolutely loved all 3 games I've done here. Agent 13 was the last one I completed and it was absolutely mind blowing. All my childhood dreams of becoming a secret agent like the movies came through. Not only do the puzzles just blow your mind there is an AMAZING storyline that keeps you immersed throughout the game. Highly recommend."

We played Tomb of Anubis, Agent 13 and The Collector! These guys are amazing. From design, gameplay, hosts! Sensational experience. If you are an escape room enthusiast you have got to check this place out."
