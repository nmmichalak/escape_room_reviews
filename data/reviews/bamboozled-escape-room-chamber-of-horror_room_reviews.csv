"Escape room ""Obsidian Sword's Chamber of Horror"" by Bamboozled Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/bamboozled-escape-room-chamber-of-horror,1,It was my first time to go to an escape room. Had a group of 10 of us for a birthday party. It was quite challenging but we worked together and managed to escape with over 10 minutes left! It was a lot of fun and want to go back and try some other rooms!
