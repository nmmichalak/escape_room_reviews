"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by Edge Of Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/edge-of-escape-time-machine,0,This was our first time visiting an Escape room and it did not disappoint! We did the Time Machine and really had a great time!  We were  impressed with the story line and the detail of the room. It was challenging and you really had to be on your toes. It was a lot of fun and I highly recommend it!

This was my first escape room experience and I would recommend this place to anyone! Everything was so well put together and the rooms and props were really cool and felt so real.

Super creative and mind-blowing. Their main goal is to make people happy and make sure they have a great time. I know they are working on 2 more rooms. Can’t wait until those are done. Highly recommended!
