"Escape room ""Six Shooter Bunk House"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-six-shooter-bunk-house,0,"Went with a group of 5, and we are all old hats at escape rooms. We've probably done about 20 so far in Vegas, St. Louis, Orlando, Phoenix, etc. This room was okay for a Tucson escape room. It was better than two other Tucson rooms we tried last weekend. The decor was very good - It did get you feeling like you were in the old west and there were some fun trinkets to look at. The downside for my group was that the puzzles/clues did not seem realistic - they were quite random and left us wondering things like, ""Why on earth would a person write that bit of info on that item??"" ""Why would a person ever hide that thing in this way?"" The puzzles and clues just weren't realistic at all. So if you are particular about authentic scenarios, you may be a bit underwhelmed here.If you don't care about practical story-lines and game play, then you will probably really enjoy this room!"

The 6 shooter room was great! We were a group of four which was perfect for the difficulty level and size of the room. We made it out of this one with seconds to spare!"
