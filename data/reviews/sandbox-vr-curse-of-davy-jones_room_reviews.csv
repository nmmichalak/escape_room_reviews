"Escape room ""Curse of Davy Jones VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-curse-of-davy-jones,0,Wow. Brought kids here for a 12year old birthday party. The staff was super helpful and friendly. The kids were suited up and enjoyed every second of the Curse of Davy Jones experience. Special bonus was we were given videos of the experience to watch back the fun later. Great addition to the mall - we will be back.
