"Escape room ""Treasure Island"" by TrappedKC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/trappedkc-treasure-island,0,"I went with a group of 8 and we did the Treasure Room. I won't delve into any details of the actual room but there were a few discrepancies which hopefully will be fixed for future customers. First, we were not told that some of the locks had to be jiggled or unlocked in just the right way to unlock. Wasted a lot of time because of this. Second, a couple of the locks were not on the right objects. Luckily we figured it out but a little more attention to set up before groups go would have been nice. The apology we got for both incidences seemed to be glazed over but hey, maybe the worker was having a bad day so I will give her the benefit of the doubt. Overall, we did have a good time. Look out for the Groupon if you want to save quite a bit!"

The staff was fabulous, the place was very clean, and it was a very creative set up in the Treasure Island Room. I will definitely be back to try Bomb Squad and bring more friends to experience Trapped KC!"
"Escape room ""Treasure Island"" by TrappedKC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/trappedkc-treasure-island,2,My family (2 adults and 2 kids ages 10 and 6) had a great time doing the Treasure Island room! The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we asked for clues they didn't actually tell us the answer. They pointed us in a different direction so we could still figure it out on our own. We've done 2 other escape rooms and Trapped KC is by far our favorite.
