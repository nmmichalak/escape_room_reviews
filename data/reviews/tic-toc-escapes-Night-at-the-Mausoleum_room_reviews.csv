"Escape room ""The Locker Room"" by Tic Toc Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/tic-toc-escapes-Night-at-the-Mausoleum,0,"This is a late review, I wanted to do this before but forgot. We had a really fun time getting out of the room there were 6 of us in the ""sports room"" and it was a great time. If you need something to do one afternoon or evening this is a great activity to try. Oh and by the way, we escaped!"

Marley was amazing, and she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. The Locker Room was a lot of fun, with some really clever puzzles. I can't recommend this place enough for a night out with friends. Did I mention Marley is awesome?"

It's very challenging and requires absolute communication and the ability to think outside of the box. It blows me away, the amount of thought of detail it takes to put together these rooms. I have done The Locker Room and look forward to the other rooms!"
