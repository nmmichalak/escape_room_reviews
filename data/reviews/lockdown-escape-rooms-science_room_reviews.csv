"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,0,We’ve done a couple escape rooms before but REALLY had a different experience here. They totally take the escape room experience to the extreme. The staff was also very helpful in assisting us while trying to get a last minute booking in! We’ll certainly be back!

This room was really cool. It is challenging and I would say that you need at least 4-8 people in order to be successful. I liked the puzzles and the suspense. I would definitely come back here. "

We thought we had this one in the bag, but we were quickly reminded that we weren't as good as we thought. This room was challenging, but perfect for 6 people. We made it out with a few seconds to spare! This escape room was one of the nicer I've seen. The store location is in the middle of Hillcrest, the lobby is decorated so nicely and everything was in good quality. The staff was fun as well. We liked it so much that we stayed and played another room! Thank you, Lockdown!"

The Science room was definitely challenging. There is a lot of math involved and a LOT more 3-5 number combo locks and some red herrings. The answers to those also involve more math. Thankfully, you get white boards to help keep them straight. The puzzles felt more there to provide a challenge than fitting well in the narrative. Some of the puzzles were clever and unique though and not all are math ones. Overall we liked and had a lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,4,"This is the first room we failed (out of ~13)... We were just one puzzle away. I would recommend doing this room with 3-4 people. Before we even started, they warned us that this room is their most difficult one and they recommend 4 people and that we start off with 6 hints (as opposed to 3 and 4).The moment we stepped into the room, we were overwhelmed by the sight of a surplus of puzzles. We messed up on one of the first puzzles and were stuck on it for very long and the hints we were initially given did not help us solve the actual issue we had until way later. Near the end, we blasted through the remaining puzzles but it wasn't enough to make up for the time we wasted with the initial puzzle. They do provide white boards with working board pens but it's still difficult to remember different qualities, move to a different location, solve the puzzle, then move to a different location to actually open a lock. The room just felt like a room filled with a bunch of harder puzzles with no real story that connects the puzzles."

This was our first time ever escaping a room, and Steven made it that much more fun! He explained the concept and helped us whenever we got stuck. Excellent room design and well thought out puzzles. Glad we stopped by!"

Did the Science room first, was challenging and we barely escaped. We'll be back for the Voodoo room! The staff was welcoming and great. Would recommend!"
