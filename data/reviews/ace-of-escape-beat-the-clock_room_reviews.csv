"Escape room ""Beat the Clock"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-beat-the-clock,0,"Our family was looking for something fun to do out of the heat that we hadn't done before. This fit the bill. We got to work as a team to solve puzzles and escape the room. The 15 year-old had as much fun as the 9 year-old, and everyone begged to go solve another room as soon as we'd finished. Highly recommended. They even opened just so we could fit them in our trip!"
