"Escape room ""CDC Laboratories - Viral Containment"" by Michigan Escape Games in Davison",https://worldofescapes.com/davison/quests/michigan-escape-games-viral-containment-cdc-labs,4,"We took our daughter for her 15th birthday and we had an great time in the CDC room. It was challenging and fun. We did have one little mix up with a lock being on the wrong door but the staff recognized right away and was in our room, explained the issue, fixed the problem and then fixed our time. We managed to escape and save the world from the virus. My daughter couldn't stop talking about it. Had an awesome time and we be planning an friends night out and do another room."

We had a team of 4 and escaped the CDC room in 46:27! It was crazy and fun, completely worth it! Can't wait to hit up all the other rooms and try our hand at getting out. A perfect couples night out or team building event. We will be back! Sooner than later!"
"Escape room ""CDC Laboratories - Viral Containment"" by Michigan Escape Games in Davison",https://worldofescapes.com/davison/quests/michigan-escape-games-viral-containment-cdc-labs,6,What an amazing experience! We went in expecting it to be more of a chore and less of a challenge. But the heist kept us working for the whole hour and kept us very entertained. We worked together as a team and had alot of fun. We were about 30 seconds short from completing the heist but we will definitely be back again!!! To anyone thinking this is going to be no fun. Or just solving puzzles and problems....I can honestly tell you that it is much more then that. The amount of thought and planning that went into these rooms is amazing. Take my word and every other review on here to heart. Take the time and take the challenge you won't regret it!
