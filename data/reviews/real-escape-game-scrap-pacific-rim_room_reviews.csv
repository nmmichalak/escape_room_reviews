"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,0,"We were able to find an open game slot the day of for a group of 6, awesome.  We did Pacific Rim, very cool!!  I personally think it helps to have seen the movie so you get the objective and some of the team requirements (like drifting).  Our group was 6 adults, 4 kids (10-13).  This was my second escape room, and I thought it was a really hard one.  There are a lot of mental puzzles, my kids had a hard time deciphering those.  They did have some physical challenges they could do, but they were out matched with this game, in my opinion.  They advised no less than 13 and I believe that is good advice.  Our MC was perfect, he helped just enough to keep it fun (versus really frustrating) but didn't give anything away, it was still a lot of hard work!  We didn't save the world, but our group still had a really great time!"
"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,1,Awesome first escape room experience! We did the Pacific Rim themed one and you definitely don't need to have seen the movie to participate. We didn't escape but we got really close. If we had about 15 more minutes we would've been okay but I'd say that's a win for the majority of our group being inexperienced with escape rooms. I don't want to spoil any of the layout or specifics but staff was super accommodating and helpful. Definitely recommend!

We chose the Pacific Rim game as it had an element of technology for our digital natives. It was lots of fun and time flew by. Our game host let us sweat just the right amount, but helped us along the way with a few clues when needed. Not only was it lots of fun and kept us on our toes the whole time, but it was really nice to see the family come together, each one taking on different roles naturally. It gave for a fun conversation afterward too on what we learned and how we can do things differently when we try another one, because we definitely will."
