"Escape room ""Helter Skelter"" by Make a Break Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/make-a-break-escape-helter-skelter,0,We did Helter Skelter and were able to escape... Very challenging and super fun... Can't wait to come back to try another room!!
"Escape room ""Helter Skelter"" by Make a Break Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/make-a-break-escape-helter-skelter,1,"Fun escape room!  We did Helter Skelter with 8 people ranging in age from 17 to 48. The theme was done well, the puzzles were clever and the game flowed well from clue to clue.  I think 6-8 people is good for this room, and I would say it is about Medium in difficulty. The host Ashley was extremely accommodating, I cannot say enough how pleased I am that she moved us to a different room that would work better for our group.  Nick was the game master, his clues were good maybe a bit too easy even, but he was extremely attentive, he could tell we were lost down a wild goose chase and nudged us along. Which keeps it fun. I will definitely be booking again for one of their many other rooms! Note: if you book Black Site, there are only 4 of you in the room together, if you have more than 4 you will not get to play together, which was why we moved our group of 8 to Helter Skelter."
