The puzzles are clever and challenging, but not frustrating. The design of the room, and all of the props and clues fit very well with the gangster theme. It is very immersive and thrusts you into the past to take down a crime boss. I highly recommend!"

It wasn't our first escape room (more like our 15th..), but Gangster's Gamble absolutely blew us away. It was definitely one of the more challenging rooms we have done, so first timers may want to check out some other escape rooms first.  But for those with a few escape rooms under their belt, Gangster's Gamble is a must."
