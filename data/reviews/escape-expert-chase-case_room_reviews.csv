"Escape room ""Chase Case"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-chase-case,0,"This was the 2nd worst room I've ever done. 45 minutes into the game we hadn't made it past the first of 3 doors because a clue that was written on a corner of a sheet of paper  (that was vital to getting through the door) was torn off and 2 locks did not work with the correct combo (looked like the locks hadn't been changed in a long while). The manager proceeded to argue with us when we failed to escape and wanted to know the solution. Will never return here. Enthusiast, be warned."
"Escape room ""Chase Case"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-chase-case,1,This venue puts to work all the tricks of the trade you have read about in any Sherlock Holmes or other sleuth adventure. Each room has a different difficulty rating. Our group utilized all four scenarios. The creativity level of each one is top notch. The hosts are witty and entertaining as they prepare you for your escape challenge. We had much fun and are hoping for a return match!

If you are in the Dallas area, you must go to this. The group I went with turned around and booked two more escape rooms for the following day. Samantha was very personable and great instructor there. Next time I am in Dallas I will make sure I go here again!"
"Escape room ""Chase Case"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-chase-case,3,"We had my son's 13 year-old birthday party at Escape Expert this past weekend. We'd never heard of this place prior to a few weeks before our event, and it sounded cool and different. My son got online, and of course, chose the 'Most Difficult' (8% success rate). He and his group of 6 or 7 12 & 13 year olds went into the event without a clue! Numerous times, the staff warned the kids that the success rate was abysmal for ADULTS - much less kids. However, my son was stubborn, and we did it. Results? We failed - BUT, we learned we were the youngest team ever to try it, and we got further than most adults, earning an ""Average"". Of course, the kids loved that they were the youngest - and were not bothered by the failure. In fact, they loved it! And we'll be back. The staff were extremely family friendly, helpful, and it's clear, very creative! And the blue-haired young lady was a stand-out, giving clear instructions and well as rock-solid life lessons. She deserves big praise!!!"

Emily, the girl with the blue hair is super friendly! She walked us through everything! We were so impressed with the entire thing. We can't WAIT to come back!!!Oooh and we were losers"
"Escape room ""Chase Case"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-chase-case,5,"We went to Dallas to take a tour of JFK Sites. I searched for something for my family to do that would be fun for our teenagers. We had 3 14 year old boys, an 18 year old boy and girl and 5 adults in their 30's and me (58). The anticipation for this event based on the descriptions we read built for months prior to our trip. The kids were so excited. We did NOT escape, but still had a wonderful fun time together! Creative, challenging, different. The staff was enough thoughtful of us and obviously cared about our experience. Everyone will talk about it and remember it for a long time. Thanks Samantha and Andrew! Your customer service is golden!"

We all had a blast! The room was SUPER challenging, although it was labeled as one of the easier rooms to escape. Samantha (I think) was our guide and she did a superb job of giving us the clues necessary to escape, although we didn't escape...I recommend this as a team building experience and well as a family bonding experience"
"Escape room ""Chase Case"" by Escape Expert in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-expert-chase-case,7,Loved this place. It's the only real life game of this kind in Dallas. It's the perfect first date venue or if you and your friends are looking for something a little different from the bar scene it's perfect and so much fun you'll be talking about it for days after.  I am planning my second visit now for a more challenging course.  The staff is also very friendly. Take the opportunity to visit. You'll be hooked and won't be disappointed.
