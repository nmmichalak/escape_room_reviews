"Escape room ""High Noon Saloon"" by Escape Room Virginia Beach in Virginia Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/virginia-beach/quests/escape-room-virginia-beach-high-noon-saloon,0,We encountered the Saloon challenge. One hour to find the clues and unlock the barkeepers safe containing gold. Of course we failed. We found it quite challenging having never did something like this before. I'd do it again now that I've got a feel for how to look for clues. It's a nice fun night out for all ages.

There's lots of brain work and the clues don't directly tell you what to do so you literally have to think. I had a great time in the group I was in.
