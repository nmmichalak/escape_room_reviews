"Escape room ""Finders Keepers"" by Frisco Escape Room in Breckenridge",https://worldofescapes.com/breckenridge/quests/frisco-escape-room-finders-keepers,1,"This place is amazing! Their rooms are built based on true stories of local Frisco area history, and when you step into the rooms you forget about everything else and become a part of the story. The staff/owner is fantastic! I can't say enough good things about this place!Took my 3 children ages 8, 10 and 11. We did the Finders Keepers challenge and were blown away with how much fun it was! Definitely a well deserved 5 stars!"
