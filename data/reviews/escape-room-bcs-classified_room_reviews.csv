"Escape room ""Classified"" by Escape Room BCS in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/escape-room-bcs-classified,0,"Classified is a fun room for new escapees.  It has some really cool aspects.  But when you are a 25+ escape room escapee, it's not that impressive.  It has too many locks and not enough ""wow"" factors for experienced players."
"Escape room ""Classified"" by Escape Room BCS in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/escape-room-bcs-classified,1,We played the Classified room and made it out just in time! We had three people. There were lots of different puzzles so each of us got a chance to figure a few out. The staff was friendly and the instructions and clues were clear and understandable. We had a good time. Would definitely come back to try some of their other puzzles!
