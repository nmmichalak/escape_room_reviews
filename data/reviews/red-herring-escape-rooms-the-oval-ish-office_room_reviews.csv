"Escape room ""The Oval-ish Office"" by Red Herring Escape Rooms in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/red-herring-escape-rooms-the-oval-ish-office,3,"Had a great time. Worth every penny. The Oval Office was a real challenge. There were only five of us and we escaped with just minutes to spare. At first we were a little disappointed at how small the room was but I'll just say, that didn't last long. We had a slow start, this being the first escape room for all, but once we got the hang of it, progressed at a steady pace. There was encouragement from the super nice man in charge of our group... I mean from the President, along the way. Would highly recommend this place."

We did the Oval-ish office. So well designed with many clever puzzles! Very challenging - bring someone smart. Brian was an excellent host and gives a great tutorial for those new to escape rooms. This is a hidden treasure in the heart of the Loop not to be missed.
