"Escape room ""Family Secrets"" by Key and Code Escape Rooms in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/key-and-code-escape-rooms-family-secrets,1,Five stars just isn’t enough for a wonderful place like this. From the moment we booked “Family Secrets” I knew the people who worked her genuinely loved what they do. Being able to accommodate 8 people and a baby wasn’t something any other place would do.Fast forward to getting there everyone was so nice and accommodating. The room was set up very well and challenging but still super fun. Not to mention they helped pull off my proposal by using a clue. This place will always have a special spot in my heart!
