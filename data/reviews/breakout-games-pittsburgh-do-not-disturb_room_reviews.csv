It was really fun!  The game masters at Breakout are really enthusiastic and add to the excitement. The game itself was interesting, challenging, and logically set up.  It had many interesting and different puzzles -- you had to use several senses to problem-solve.  No spoilers, but I know that you will enjoy this game!"
