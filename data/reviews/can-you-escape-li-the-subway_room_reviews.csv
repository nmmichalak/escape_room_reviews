"Escape room ""The Subway"" by Can You Escape? LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/can-you-escape-li-the-subway,0,Highly recommended. We were a starter group and the subway room was awesome. We got through it and made it out but it was a complete team effort with no short of difficult puzzles to figure out. Our Game Master/Hostess Karrie was great. Explained everything well and articulate while maintaining her sense of cool and fun. A definite plus. Good stuff.

The subway train was a fun and interesting experience as well. I wish the rooms had more repercussions for losing/things to throw you off your game like the mobile room but alas a great time nonetheless.

LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/can-you-escape-li-the-subway,2,"My friend and I were welcomed by 2 of the staff in the lobby and they were both very friendly. After being showed the bathroom and advised to use it before going into the room, we waited for the rest of our room to arrive. We were paired with 2 others and off to the room we went. The staff member who was working our room explained the rules and then we were locked in the Subway. The whole experience was definitely fun and challenging. However, as others wrote, the sound system didn't work very well and the staff member didn't always respond if we asked for a clue or she would give a clue to something we already found. We didn't end up getting out, but since this was everyone's first experience, we definitely did a decent job. I wouldn't recommend this to kids or anyone who gets bored easily."
