"Escape room ""The Attic"" by NC Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/nc-escape-the-attic,0,The attic was so much fun. Loved the jump scare parts. We made it out!
"Escape room ""The Attic"" by NC Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/nc-escape-the-attic,1,"I've gone to 2 other escape rooms in the triangle and this just might be #1. We did The Attic with 2 players and finished with time left. The puzzles make you think, but they make sense and aren't impossible. I've been to an escape room locally where the puzzle, even when explained, didn't even make sense. The room was nicely done and had some cool tricks. The jumps were fun. I can't wait to do another room there when we find some people. I do wish there was another room we could do with just 2 people. It's easier when me and my husband are on a date night alone. They don't come in the room to give you clues, they use an iPad in the room, and I find this saves time. They will give you clues that you don't ask for if they see you've been working for a while, but I think you can decline those before you go in or just don't look at the iPad until you're ready. Megan was great and the other girl was encouraging. Looking forward to returning!"
"Escape room ""The Attic"" by NC Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/nc-escape-the-attic,2,Great experience!! My son and I did The Attic room and thoroughly enjoyed it! Laurin was our host and did a great job with the hints when we needed them! The jump scares in this room were perfect! We had a great time and will go back to do the other rooms! Thanks Laurin and NC Escape!!
