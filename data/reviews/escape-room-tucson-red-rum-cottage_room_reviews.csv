We laughed, we screamed, we used our brains and we escaped! The room was very well done, seriously impressive (we did the Red Rum Cottage). Our game master Courtney delivered her clues in character using a great spooky voice!"

Unfortunately, we did not get out but looking forward to booking again. Our group of 6 paired well with the other four that booked the room. The room master was amazing! Such an awesome time - will definitely be coming back. If anyone is looking for something to do that is out of the norm I highly recommend the escape room!"

Very cleverly thought out room designs. My family went and we all loved it. I would HIGHLY recommend this place! It will not be easy, it will challenge your thinking but is definitely doable with cooperation. We escaped with just 45 secs to go. Will definitely do another!"
