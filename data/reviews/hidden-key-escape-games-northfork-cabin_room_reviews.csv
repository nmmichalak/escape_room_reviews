"Escape room ""Northfork Cabin"" by Hidden Key Escape Games in Whitefish",https://worldofescapes.com/whitefish/quests/hidden-key-escape-games-northfork-cabin,0,I went for the first time with my fianc√© and we can't stop talking about how much fun we had with the North Fork Cabin game. We got stuck a few times but our game master Andrew was awesome and encouraging. A must do if you live in Whitefish or are visiting the area. We can't wait to go back to try their other games!
