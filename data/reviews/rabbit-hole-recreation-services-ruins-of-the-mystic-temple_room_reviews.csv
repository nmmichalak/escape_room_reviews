"Escape room ""Ruins of the Mystic Temple"" by Rabbit Hole Recreation Services in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/rabbit-hole-recreation-services-ruins-of-the-mystic-temple,0,"Ruins of the Mystic Temple is an escape room adventure that doesn't disappoint. Temple's production design is the clear highlight. Scenic elements, lighting, sound, and electronic effects combine to create the immersive experience of exploring a pre-Columbian complex of chambers. The mission is straightforward: find the treasure before your ex-partner does. The objective is more mercenary than the typical tomb adventure but it leads to a fun ""payoff."" Puzzles include logic and translation challenges presented with thoughtful design, interesting props, and technological flair. Puzzle difficulty ranged quite a bit, and I could imagine solvers of all levels of experience finding ways to contribute. Temple is among the best escapes I've played in Colorado!"
"Escape room ""Ruins of the Mystic Temple"" by Rabbit Hole Recreation Services in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/rabbit-hole-recreation-services-ruins-of-the-mystic-temple,1,"I've done over 110 escape rooms all over the United States and Mystic Temple is among my top 10. I went to 5 different escape room companies in the Denver area over the weekend, and Rabbit Hole Recreation Services is by far the best in the area. Do yourself a favor and take my advice and come to their escape room. The staff was super friendly, the room was high tech and non-linear. Did I also mention their price was very fair for the amount of work they put into their room. I will make a special trip to come back just do their other rooms when they open."
