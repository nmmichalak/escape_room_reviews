"Escape room ""Legacy Lost"" by The Exit Room in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/The-Exit-Game-Legacys-Lost,0,So much fun. We did Legacy Lost as a private group of 6 people. Barely made it out in time because we got sidetracked a few times. It was a terrific use of brainpower and communication.

It's a family run business and the entire family are kind and friendly which only serves to make the entire experience amazing. Definitely worth the drive out to Lee's Summit from Kansas City. I'll be coming back very soon."
