"Escape room ""Castaway"" by Tropic Escape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/tropic-escape-castaway,0,"Sooo much fun! Hard as heck, but so much fun! Weâ€™ll be back to do a different room. We did Castaway."
"Escape room ""Castaway"" by Tropic Escape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/tropic-escape-castaway,1,"We have done a lot of escape rooms across the Southeast, and Tropic Escape Rooms is our favorite of Southwest Florida - Naples, Ft. Myers, Bonita Springs, Estero. We have made three visits to Tropic, and played their Museum, Finals and Castaway rooms. All of the rooms told an interesting story and the game masters were very helpful and welcoming. I'd recommend their rooms to both enthusiasts in the area and new players. This venue is clearly run and designed by people who also love escape games, and they built rooms they'd want to play. And most of all, they've built their rooms to be fun from start to finish. Their most recently built room Castaway really stands out in its overall story and complexity. The designs of the multiple rooms within this experience were extremely detailed. For Southwest Florida, this is perhaps the most highly immersive escape game with so many spaces, and a tight storyline. As Tropic continues to grow, we will definitely return. "
"Escape room ""Castaway"" by Tropic Escape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/tropic-escape-castaway,2,"My wife and I have played over 60 escape rooms all over the southeast and Tropic Escape's Rooms are definitely in the top tier of games we've played. The place is a 20-30 minute drive from the Naples area but well worth the trip. We first played the ""Almost Famous"" room and later in the week played the ""Castaway"" room. Both were fantastic and very well done.Almost Famous had great scenic and state-of-the-art equipment inside the room. One of my favorite parts of this room is that you have to make a decision before you even start the game that leads to one of the most unique final puzzles I've ever seen! The tech in this room is amazing. There were a variety of really fun, immersive, hands on puzzles that lead to a ""Wow, how did they make that work?"" reaction when solved. Overall, a very, very fun room.Castaway is touted as their most difficult room and they are not kidding. The room is very challenging, but in a fun way, not in a frustrating or tedious way. There are a lot of puzzles to solve, but the solutions to the puzzles are logical, make sense, and can be solved reasonably quick once you figure out what to do. There is not a lot of ""busy work"" to do just to eat up time. The scenic is also extremely well done. The immersion factor is on point with lightning effects, flickering lights, and the sound of thunder welcoming you as soon as you walk into the room. This room offers several other ""wow"" factors as well.After we finished, we spent some time speaking to the owner and you could tell he got into the escape game business because he loved it. He told us that he only designs and builds games that he'd want to play and be proud of. He is passionate about the industry and you can see that in the product he's created. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. They are among the best in the area."
