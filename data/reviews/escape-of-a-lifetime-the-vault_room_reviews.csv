"Escape room ""The Vault"" by Escape Of A Lifetime in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-of-a-lifetime-the-vault,0,I have been to several escape rooms and love them so when I saw Escape of a Lifetime open I said I have to come there. It is rare to meet the owner of the escape rooms but Craig the owner not only was present but he was the gamemaster. I did the Vault and did not escape but it was because of a few things. Since I have done so many escape rooms I overlooked some of the more simple clues and details. Doing this escape room made me reevaluate how I play escape rooms which is a good thing:) The Vault was well put together. Craig took the time to work on the details so it actually seemed like I was in a vault. Craig personally delivers the clues when you request one and it doesn't take him a long time to give the clue which has been an issue I had with other places who use the gamemaster entering the room. Craig is very energetic and you can see that escape rooms are his 'lifetime' of work as he gives it his all. He mentioned that he is developing others rooms and the rooms have themes I have not heard of in other escape room companies so I will definitely be back

The entire room is basically a combination of many locks and figuring out very basic clues. There was no frills or excitement. A rather ""low tech"" experience. The room was very hot (supposedly on purpose to set the scene) and the fan did not do much to alleviate the heat. The man giving instructions and clues was very friendly and was a good host. Not a bad experience. Worth the Groupon but would not pay full price. Can You Escape LI reigns supreme."
