These rooms were fantastic and you can tell that they are definitely made with love. Jack and Braden were awesome as control masters and the rooms were a lot of fun. It is tough to make the drive all the way out to Mesa, but we will definitely be back to collect the rest of those bracelets!"

There were four of us. Two adults, two teens. It was a multiple room room. Lots of fun and excitement! Was one of my favorite escape rooms to do. The three people I was with were new to escape rooms. It said medium difficulty. A very well thought out room. We will be back soon to do the carn-evil room."
