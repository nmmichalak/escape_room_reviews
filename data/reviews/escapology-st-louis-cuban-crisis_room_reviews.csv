Never done an Escape Room before, we went out for date night on a Saturday night. Even though it was super busy, our Host made sure we received enough attention and answered all our questions (and there were many questions, thank you again Sam!). The room looked super neat and we really felt like we had traveled into a story. Need to look into bringing my work team here, especially with that great Corporate room next to it. Thanks again!"

It sure was a memory maker for Grammy, Grampa and our 15-year-old grandson! My husband and I will be back for date night and with groups of friends. Thanks, Sam for making our experience so fantastic!"
