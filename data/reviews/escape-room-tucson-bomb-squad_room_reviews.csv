"Escape room ""Bomb Squad"" by Escape Room Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/escape-room-tucson-bomb-squad,1,"I honestly feel like we just successfully defused a bomb hahahaha! I'd never done one of these before, and I'm ashamed to say I was not really expecting much. However, from the moment I set foot in the place, I knew it was going to be fun and challenging. The staff do a great job of teaching how to play, and really play their roles to make it feel ""real"". The owner puts a lot of TLC and expertise into her work building the rooms, and it shows. It's not at all cheesy like I kind of thought it might be. I was 10 minutes into my first puzzle and already wanted to do another one afterward. Go do it."

Out of our group of 7, 5 people were first-timers so this room's intermediate difficulty was a good fit.The owner has a lot of passion and enthusiasm for escapes, and it showed in the room. Lots of well-designed puzzles and activities with an overall high production value.I've done quite a few escapes and this is the first one where there was a human monitor or guide in the room. I think this takes away from the experience, so that would be my one criticism. Our guide jumped in too often without us asking for help.Other than that, great experience and worth the money! We're planning to visit again."

We really enjoyed figuring out the puzzle and solving the clues. At first I think we were all totally confused, but we caught on quickly and in our group of all first-timers, we somehow managed to pull off the second fastest time in solving the room!"

It is a great team building activity to test communication and working as a group. We started with the ""easy"" room, but it was still very challenging for us. Originally, we booked the cold war room, but quickly realized it wasn't a good fit for our first time. AJ, the owner, was polite and flexible and adjusted accordingly."
