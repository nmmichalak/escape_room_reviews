"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Westgate in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-westgate-the-lost-tomb,0,It was a wonderful time for first timers to the Escape Room experience. Highly recommend. The staff was fantastic.
"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Westgate in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-westgate-the-lost-tomb,1,"I just completed their Lost Tomb escape room and it is easily one of the best escape rooms of the 30-40 I've ever done. It was almost like walking onto the set of Legends of the Hidden Temple. It really sold the atmosphere of being inside a temple, and aside from a bit of a very minor frustration with one specific searching puzzle I had no real issues of note. I will definitely be back for their Bill and Ted and Terminator rooms and will be recommending them to all my friends who like escape rooms. If you are looking for a really well done room I recommend Escape Westgate, you'll have a fantastic time. Plus one the owners look like Michael Douglas so that a bonus!"

We did the lost tomb theme and it was challenging and exciting. The rooms were really well done and the staff was great. Great experience for a great price ! Can't wait to do the terminator theme coming up!

It was a little difficult but with 10 of us we were able to get through it with 20 minutes left which was pretty quick. This is definitely good for kids and adults , great props and design put into this . Can't wait to try the terminator room next ."
