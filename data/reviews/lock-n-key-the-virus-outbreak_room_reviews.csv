"Escape room ""The Quest for the Throne"" by Lock & Key Escape Room in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/lock-n-key-the-virus-outbreak,0,"Our experience here was super fun! We did ""The Quest For The Throne"" room with a group of 8 friends. It was pretty easy to track down some of the initial clues and figure out the puzzles. There were only a couple of instances in which we got a little stuck, in which case our guide would slide hints written on a piece of paper beneath the door. We worked together as a team and were able to escape the room with only about 8 minutes left to spare! I had a great time and will definitely consider Lock & Key again if I'm ever looking for a cool place to do an escape room."

We all said we would do it again when they open up the new theme/story in next month or so. Communication is key. Talk to your team members and let them know if you found a clue or have already worked on something. Also, don't overlook things, the item is probably there for a reason."
