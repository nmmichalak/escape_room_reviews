"Escape room ""The Penitentiary"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-penitentiary-ca,0,"I've been to all three rooms at Omescape, and each room has a very different theme and feel from the other. For me personally the best one was the Penitentiary! It has a very cool laser tunnel and we were separated into two groups and had to work together to rescue the two that were locked up in a room and escaped together. We didn't solve the last puzzle in time to escape but were very close! Highly recommend this place."
"Escape room ""The Penitentiary"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-penitentiary-ca,1,I booked a Sunday evening penitentiary game for a group of my smartest friends and we had so much fun! Very engaging and everyone in my group adored it. The Cons:Finding this place takes time.It's in the middle of nowhere.They charge $15 for cutting a cake in the lobby - even if you cleaned after yourself.The Pros:The game is excellent. Play with complete strangers and you'll become close friends at the end of the 60 minutes.

It was super legit and all the items were of quality. Laser, mirrors, secret keys, the works!!! (I promise I doesn't take anything away!). Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Worth the drive up. Will probably come back for another room. Challenging but definitely able to solve it."

It was really a lot of fun, even though we didn't escape from the penitentiary room. We actually got to the last stage, but just couldn't cross the finish line. However, the journey was much more enjoyable than the final results."

Really enjoyed my experience in Omescape today."
