"Escape room ""Curse on the Emerald Seas"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-curse-on-the-emerald-seas,1,My family visited Phoenix Escape Room at the recommendation of a friend. Our ages varied from 6-46 -- and we all had an amazing time. The whole experience was really well done. I'd recommend them in a second.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."
