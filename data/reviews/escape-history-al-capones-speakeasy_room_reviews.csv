"Escape room ""Al Capone's Speakeasy"" by Escape History in Warren",https://worldofescapes.com/warren-oh/quests/escape-history-al-capones-speakeasy,0,Went with coworkers and had an amazing time. Most of my team has never done an escape room before and they're already talking about coming back to try the others. Escape History is the 5th room I've been to and by far one of my favorites. Haven't done their Titanic room but that one is definitely next on the list. The puzzles were well thought out and crafted and the staff did a very nice job explaining the mission and story. Definitely recommend checking these guys out if you're in the Youngstown/Niles area!

Started off with the Capone room and my kids can't stop talking about it. They already want to go back and do their WW2 room next.

Was similar in process to other escape rooms I have done but the story was weaved into the game better than most rooms I've seen. You actually felt a part of the game and the host did a good job of keeping us on track. Can't wait to go back and try their other 2 rooms soon."
"Escape room ""Al Capone's Speakeasy"" by Escape History in Warren",https://worldofescapes.com/warren-oh/quests/escape-history-al-capones-speakeasy,3,My family and I had an amazing time in Escape History's Speakeasy room! We are a group of veterans/first timers and the puzzles were a pleasant mix of logic and physicality. I definitely recommend for all ages although it might be tougher for kids. Loved the decor of the space as well.
"Escape room ""Al Capone's Speakeasy"" by Escape History in Warren",https://worldofescapes.com/warren-oh/quests/escape-history-al-capones-speakeasy,4,Had an amazing time at Escape History with my family! Went over Thanksgiving break while we were visiting friends and did 2 of their rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful which made for a great experience. Puzzles made sense and didn't stretch logic thin like some other rooms and the set design was some of the best I've seen.
