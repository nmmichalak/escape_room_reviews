"Escape room ""The Hero"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-the-hero,0,"New location!! They are located at the Wyndam Hotel on Lewers street. It is easy to locate them, just look for the Hotel sign and Breakout is on the left! There should be signs. Our group tried The Hero as a beta room on March 10th and we also chose the ""public room"" which included random people. (2) The prices were half off since it was a beta room and the public room option also made it cheaper. It turned out to be less than $15 a person! If you would like a private room option it is a bit more expensive, and hey! Two heads are better than one!The two people we met up with were super friendly and pleasant to work with. It was nice experiencing a different dynamic beyond our group of friends. The biggest part of escape rooms is communication! Since we were beta testers, there were some complications and it set us back, but our room supervisor? the worker? added on 5 more minutes for us. We escaped! The biggest challenge was actually parking LOL, we weren't sure where to park for the new location. Just follow the directions on Breakout's FAQ about parking. It is at the Embassy Suite and the only option is valet. It $6 with validation, and after parking just go to the right side down the hall and cross the street and go a bit more down and breakout will be towards your right! It's a 2 minute walk. The workers are always welcoming and very nice. They know that the experience can be a bit scary to people (esp. for scaredy cats like me) and always make me feel comfortable. I've done a total of 4 rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Hero"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-the-hero,1,"I had bought 2 spaces for a friend and I to do the hero. I liked it but i didn't find it to be as challenging as other escape rooms I've done. The staff was very nice and the space was nice. I think they were still doing construction though because the space didn't look completed. We had been put with another group which I didn't mind however it was a bit awkward because when checking in they didn't tell us we were going to be with another group. Because of this, the room was kind of awkward to do especially because we hadn't acquainted ourselves with the other group in the lobby since we didn't know we'd be working with them. I think that this place is good for large groups but I probably wouldn't recommend it for a small group since there's a possibility of being with another random group. I enjoyed it, but with the reviews I expected the room to be more challenging."

I completed (and barely escaped: The Hero) a room with my husband during our honeymoon and it was definitely AMAZING, one of the highlights of our trip. Our top and most favorite room of all of the 10+ we have completed all over California. They have a high level of technology and the friendliest staff! Do it! You will not regret it!"
