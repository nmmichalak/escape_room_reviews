Only thing I wish were that parking were better and if things were started a little more on time. Still, not bad."

Would've been better with more people, we only had two, but I will definitely be back to do the other rooms and hope they add some new ones!"

We seriously had 1:17 left and we were getting anxious. Had a blast working together and were SO thankful for our clue's. We wouldn't have known where to begin if it weren't for our first clue, especially since it was our first time there. I can't wait to plan my next visit!! So glad to have something new, fun, and exciting to do in town!"

This was so much fun! There were 6 in our group and we did the island escape. The puzzles were more difficult than I thought they would be but that is what made it a real challenge and fun! If the clues had been too easy it could have been boring...but they aren't, they are prefect!!! Taylor was our host and he was an awesome! Tip your hosts. They greatly appreciate it and are worth it...they are ensuring your group has a good time after all. Highly recommend for family, friends, or work!"
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Louisville in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/Breakout-Louisville-Island-Escape,7,We did the Island Escape as a family and it was a great time! We were definitely challenged and had only 20 seconds to spare when we made it out. As a family we have a very competitive side but during the challenge we realized it was more about escaping then setting a record. We enjoyed it so much that we have already started talking about our next challenge even though we are rarely all in town. Thanks for the opportunity to be together and enjoy laughter and the thrill of victory! Our Game Master was awesome as well! I hope we kept him sufficiently entertained.
