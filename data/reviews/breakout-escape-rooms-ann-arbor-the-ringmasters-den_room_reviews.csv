"Escape room ""The Ringmaster's Den"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-ann-arbor-the-ringmasters-den,0,"Not too bad, but I was more impressed with rooms I've played elsewhere (Decode Detroit).  I thought that the storyline for this room was a little thin, and the person who did the introduction and the debriefing (after we became circus performers forever by failing to solve the clues) wasn't in character or really very enthusiastic.  The clues were fairly interesting (and plenty hard), but not as inventive as in other rooms I've played.  Also part of the challenge was just that the room was somewhat dimly lit - I felt like it was testing my eyesight more than my mind.  Overall I enjoyed it, but not as much as the two others I've played.  "

"Escape room ""The Ringmaster's Den"" by Breakout Escape Rooms in Ann Arbor",https://worldofescapes.com/ann-arbor/quests/breakout-escape-rooms-ann-arbor-the-ringmasters-den,3,"Celebrated birthdays with friends and our group of 10 had a wonderful time. The instructions at the beginning were very helpful and straightforward. Loved the room decor and setup, helpful clues and pace, and so exciting working through the puzzles. It was our first escape room experience, and the first time this specific 10 people had worked together, so The Ringmaster's Den was the perfect fit for us. We were able to breakout with moments to spare, and it sounds like we've convinced others to check it out as well. Highly recommend."
