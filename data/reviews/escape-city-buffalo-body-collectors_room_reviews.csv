"Escape room ""Body Collectors"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-body-collectors,0,"This was second time I went to Escape City Buffalo because I loved their other room so much. I was a little worried about how scary this room would be, but it strikes the right balance of creepy and fun. All the puzzles made sense, which is surprisingly rare sometimes. I can't wait for the next room to open so I can come back! "
"Escape room ""Body Collectors"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-body-collectors,1,"The Body Collectors was a ton of fun with just the right amount of creepiness. It felt good to make it out, but it didn't come easy. The people at this place were awesome and you can tell they put hard work into making sure their guests have a great time. Can't wait to go back."
"Escape room ""Body Collectors"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-body-collectors,2," This was by far the most seamless transition from Haunted House to Escape Room in the area. They did not rely on their sets to distract from poor quality puzzles, but were able to knock both aspects out of the park. The Body Collectors included challenging puzzles as well as an incredible atmosphere that transported you exactly where they wanted you to be. We can all learn something from their impeccable execution. From the lobby to the last lock, this was a top notch experience."
"Escape room ""Body Collectors"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-body-collectors,3,"The hype about ""movie set quality"" is completely legit! Definitely the best atmosphere of all 11 rooms our group has done! And for anyone who thinks they shouldn't try Body Collectors because it'll be too scary, it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. You really are too engrossed in the game to get scared by anything else!"

I am not one for scary scenes but I did really enjoy this room! We had a blast last night and we will definitely be going back for the other room in hopes to break the record!"
"Escape room ""Body Collectors"" by Escape City Buffalo in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/escape-city-buffalo-body-collectors,6,"Went with a group of four for the Body Collectors room. We are experienced escape artists and this room did not disappoint! They truly have taken the time and effort into making this place everything you could ever want and more. Our host, Trevor, was awesome, he genuinely wanted our input on the room and made our experience worth while. We will be back for sure!"
