"Escape room ""The Twilight Zone"" by Xscapes in Binghamton",https://worldofescapes.com/binghamton/quests/xscapes-the-twilight-zone,0,"So fun! Brought our Girl Scout troop of 12 year olds and they had a GREAT time!  Some escape rooms are literally just one room and this was a series of rooms, which was VERY cool. Lots of challenging and fun puzzles, activities, hidden objects, etc.VERY nice job with the Twilight Zone theme and we learned a lot about Rod Serling.Clutch, who was our host, was so great helping us move along when we go stuck.Completely recommend!"

My second escape room experience,  brought husband and adult son - first time for them. Much more challenging than the one I had done in San Diego. Great Twilight Zone theme. It was only us three, math-brained types. We were not able to escape on time ourselves, agree with our host that 6 or so people would be better. But we thoroughly enjoyed the experience, the clever design and intricate puzzles. "

"Escape room ""The Twilight Zone"" by Xscapes in Binghamton",https://worldofescapes.com/binghamton/quests/xscapes-the-twilight-zone,4,"Amazing experience! I've done about 15-20 escape rooms by now in my life, and the Twilight Zone themed one I did at Xscapes was BY FAR the best! Amazing logic challenges, clever technology, and well placed special effects, all centered around a super-cool theme! And that's not the only good room they have here- I recently brought a camp of 30+ high school aged boys that we divided between the various rooms at Xscapes. The guys loved it! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun outing. And helps support an amazing cause on top of that!On behalf of all the campers at Morasha Kollel, thanks so much for giving us an amazing experience! We definitely hope to return again next year, and looking forward to seeing some of the new rooms you have up by then!"

Impressive how much thought was put into designs and puzzles. I highly recommended. Todd and Bill were great hosts and puzzle makers! Thank you.
