"Escape room ""Bank Robbery Escape"" by Master Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/The-Master-Escape-Room-FBI-Investigation,0,"A bit hard to find, but well worth it. The scenario my group did was the bank robbery. A room full of clues, locks, and all manner of strange twists and turns. The hour was full of challenges that tested every member of our team.The staff were very friendly and helpful. I recommend this experience. We're already talking about doing the Egyptian Tomb soon."
