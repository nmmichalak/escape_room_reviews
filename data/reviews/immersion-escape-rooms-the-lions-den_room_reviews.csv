"Escape room ""The Lion’s Den"" by Immersion Escape Rooms in Charlottesville",https://worldofescapes.com/charlottesville/quests/immersion-escape-rooms-the-lions-den,2,I have now done both the Lions Den and House Arrest Escapes. I love how the stories connect. I was so immersed in the experience that I wanted to take on the role of the Characters in the story. I have been to another escape room in VA beach and Immersion was far better designed. The ambiance is wonderful. I can't wait to do more rooms here once they are released.

We were so pleased with House Arrest that we considered doing Lion's Den as soon as we were finished, but came back another weekend. Everything is well put together, starting with the atmosphere of the waiting room. The clues were clever and you can tell a lot of work was put into this. We did have a hard time with Lion's Den. There were so many pieces that took time (even with 6 people) and had to be just right. But it was still a fun challenge."
