"Escape room ""The Lost Soul"" by LOK'd Room Escape in Manchester",https://worldofescapes.com/manchester/quests/LOK-d-The-Lost-Soul,0,I took 5 kids to Lok'd and we did The Lost Soul. We all loved it! It was our first escape room. The staff was fantastic and made our experience a fantastic one. I would highly recommend! The fact that they don't have the restrictions that some of the other escape rooms do regarding children was the reason I chose them. The experience itself is the reason I would go back!

Lok'd was good about letting the kids figure it out, but giving little hints when needed. We're already talking about other trips back!"
