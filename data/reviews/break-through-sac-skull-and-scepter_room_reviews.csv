We did the Skull And Scepter room on expert mode. Very challenging but so much fun. We will be back for sure.

Larry was an awesome Game Master!! He made sure our hints where not to obvious but helpful and really made it a great experience since two of us have never done an Escape Room before. We had one Vet, a second timer and two newbies and we escaped with 2mins left out of an hour and had a blast the whole time. We WILL be back for more!"

Larry was our Game master and he was awsome. Way more attentive than most Game masters. Also he never directly gave us an answer to a clue, he just guided us to our conclusion. All in all I'd rate this one more than 5 stars and I will definitely be back for Vipers Nest."
