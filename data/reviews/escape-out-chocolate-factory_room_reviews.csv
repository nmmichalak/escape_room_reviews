"Escape room ""Chocolate Factory"" by Escape Out in Asheville",https://worldofescapes.com/asheville/quests/escape-out-chocolate-factory,0,"The two rooms felt very cheap and not worth the price.  Some of the mechanisms didn't work, or didn't make a loud enough noise that we had to be told when something happened  I was so cheap we solved some of the puzzles with just educated guessing at the locks and codes.  Other rooms by this company where much better made for the price.  I wouldn't recommend this room. "
