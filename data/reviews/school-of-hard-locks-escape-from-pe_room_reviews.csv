"Escape room ""Escape from P.E."" by School of Hard Locks in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/school-of-hard-locks-escape-from-pe,1,"We had so much fun at School of Hard Locks!  It was our first time at an Escape Room and we definitely want to return to try another room.  It was a perfect family activity, especially since we have some family members who are not overly active and we have others that are!  The age of our group of 8 - 75 and we had 8 people, and everyone helped and participated.  We did Escape from PE and it was pretty hard. We needed help, but I was still proud of our progress.  The staff was kind and fun!  Looking forward to going back again soon!"

Escape from PE was tough with all the locks. Wish there had been more than one room to escape from besides the locker room. Overall good experience.
