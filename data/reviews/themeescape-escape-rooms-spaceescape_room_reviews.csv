"Escape room ""Sector X"" by Themescape Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/themeescape-escape-rooms-spaceescape,0,I absolutely enjoyed the themes of each room because they are unique and equally challenging. What a great team building exercise. I cannot wait for the upcoming Sector X and hope to be one of the first to try and escape.

Sector X was nothing like what we had experienced at other escape rooms. It had really cool effects, sounds and incredible games to figure out! No doubt an out of this world experience that you won't soon forget. You can tell these folks are passionate about what they do by the attention to detail they put into everything!"
