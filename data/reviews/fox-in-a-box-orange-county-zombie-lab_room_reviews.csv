"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-zombie-lab,0,"Second time here, did the Zombie Lab, extremely fun. Personally I find this one better than the Bank, but others do not share my opinion. We saved the world with 38 seconds to spare."
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-zombie-lab,1,The Zombie Lab did not disappoint! The room was very detailed with just enough props to get your mind thinking. The puzzles and clues reflected the storyline. My group of three did escape and only need a few hints. I look forward to returning to try the zodiac killer room.

The room is very immersive, the clues are given through a TV in the room and the game host was amazing. The room itself was very well done, the puzzles were unique to the other 29 escape rooms I have done and they were cohesive to the theme. Now that I have done this room, I can't wait to come back to do their other rooms."
