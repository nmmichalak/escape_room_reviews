"Escape room ""Jester's Revenge"" by No. 1 Escapes in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/no-1-escapes-jesters-revenge,0,Jester's Revenge was AWESOME! I thought the room was very creative and a lot of the puzzles/challenges were well thought out. We had a group of 7 and that seemed like the perfect size for this escape particular escape room. We managed to finish but barely did it on time! The girl who helped us there was extremely nice as well and she made sure that all of us had a good time! Definitely going back to try the other room out next!

The staff was super friendly and helpful. Allison was super sweet and very patient with us since it was only our second time doing an escape room. We loved the first room so much (Jesters Revenge) that we decided to do the second room (Treasure of the Nation) that same night and what's great is that if you do a second ro that same day, they will give you 20% off!"

It was such a fun, challenging experience for a group.  Very hard to figure out but worth the time it takes.  Would do it again."

This was probably the best escape room I’ve done. The people who designed it created fun, challenging, and unique puzzles. I thought the design was well laid out and you had to work together with your other teammates to figure out the solutions. All of the employees were so friendly and kind. We spoke to Brandon on the phone and he warmly explained everything to us in detail. Then we had a friendly woman who set us up acted as our jester. She made the experience even more fun. I was very impressed and I’m so looking forward to trying their other room!"
