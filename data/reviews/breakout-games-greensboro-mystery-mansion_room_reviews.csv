"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-mystery-mansion,0,The experience was so much fun! It was worth the price & the drive there. Only wish is that we would’ve planned to do more! Ben was a great proctor & made the experience even more enjoyable! The room wasn’t too easy or too hard it and had really creative riddles! 10/10 recommend!
"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-mystery-mansion,1,This was our first escape room experience and it was amazing! We did Mystery Mansion with our 11 and 12 year olds. It was a lot of fun! Definitely not “easy”. We finished 5 seconds too late! Molly was our host and she was wonderful! She had to help us with a few clues here and there when we were stuck. We can’t wait to try some of the other rooms!

Very challenging and even though we didn't escape, we still had fun. Molly was our game master and was great and explained what we didn't figure out."

My group was able to break out with a few minutes to spare thanks to her helpful but not too helpful clues! This was my first time playing a break out game ( Mystery Mansion) and I would definitely go back to play the other ones! So much fun!
