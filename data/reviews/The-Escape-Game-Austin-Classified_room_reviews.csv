We did the Classified room and even though we were alone and didn't have any other help we had so much fun, unfortunately we didn't make it out in time, we had 1 more clue to go, but I would still highly recommend it.The staff were so friendly and helpful and overall the experience was fantastic.The location is downtown however you can park at the convention center and it only cost us $5, the place itself is right next to the convention center.Bottom line: if you love puzzles, games and challenges, but also love having a good fun time then this is the place for you!"

Challenging but doable, not too easy at all. Such a great time! We don't live in Austin but will be back to try the other three rooms for sure. "

Can't wait to do their other three games, and the staff is very friendly but thankfully quite hands off when you are playing. Highly recommended if you like puzzles and want a very memorable and engaging experiences with friends, family, or co-workers."

Great attention to detail and the rooms have the perfect blend of challenge, skill, and fun. I would definitely recommend if you have small group and an hour to kill."
