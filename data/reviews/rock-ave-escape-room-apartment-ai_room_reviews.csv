We completed it, but once the other rooms open we’ll have to come back because the story doesn’t end in the apartment!"

I brought my 8 and 6-year-old and it was definitely family friendly! It was still challenging but they could work along with us to solve the clues! Thank you for creating something super fun that the whole family can enjoy together!

"Escape room ""Apartment A.I."" by Rock Ave Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/rock-ave-escape-room-apartment-ai,4,"This was one of my favorite escape rooms so far. It's got this unique single storyline throughout all the rooms! They only have one room open so far, but the rest are coming soon and will continue the epic storyline they've created! My girlfriend, Kristin and I pulled through with 17 minutes and some change left to go! We had an awesome time solving the puzzles and cannot wait for the other rooms to open up so we can save Dominic from the evil AI! We definitely recommend Rock Ave, so head on over and try to beat our time! Thank you, Mayor Rob, for an awesome time! We will be back!"
