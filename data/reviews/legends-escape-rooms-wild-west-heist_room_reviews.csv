It was my first experience in an escape room and I loved it! The puzzles were challenging, but not so much so that we were frustrated. It was a lot of fun! Can't wait to go back and try the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Wild West Heist"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-wild-west-heist,2,I am a fellow escape room owner and I have done tons of rooms. This was definitely up there in my favorite rooms that I have done. The Wild West room was well designed and the puzzles all made sense. No crazy logic leaps. I will definitely recommend Legends Escape Rooms to all my friends in the area. They are by far the best in the Brandon area and one of the top in the entire Tampa area. Can't wait to try the rest of their rooms when I am in town again.
