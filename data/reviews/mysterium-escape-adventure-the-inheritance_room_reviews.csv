"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Mysterium Escape Adventure in Boone",https://worldofescapes.com/boone/quests/mysterium-escape-adventure-the-inheritance,2,Loved visiting Boone's first escape room while we were in town! We are in the Charlotte area and have been to at least 6 different locations here. The one in Boone is one of my favorites out of all of them. Can't wait to visit again after they expand or do a new room!

Storyline was an exciting one for sure! Room decor was awesome, special effects were really neat! Had not been in an escape room like this one before. Booking online was incredibly easy - can't wait to go back for a second room when it is open."
