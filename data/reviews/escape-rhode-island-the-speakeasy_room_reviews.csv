"Escape room ""The Speakeasy"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-speakeasy,0,"A great adventure for a bunch of friends. In our case six, celebrating a birthday. The puzzle was clever with enough twists and turns and activities to keep everyone occupied with simultaneous problem-solving at various stations. A good set up. Not one linear path and that kept everyone engaged. Also, good balance of puzzle types. Math. Word. Visual. We did the Speakeasy room and came close, but failed to solve all three questions. Once time expired, the operator kindly walked us through the solution. Nicely done."

The six of us did the Speakeasy Room together. It was so much fun. Challenging brain teasers where each of us made pivotal contributions to solving the game. No one else had been before but they all left talking about going back, my daughter included! I had been previously with my office & done the Bunker. The game creators here are really good. The game managers are excellent. I would highly recommend this escape room! Grab a nice lunch or dinner right nearby too - we went to Hemmingways this time."
