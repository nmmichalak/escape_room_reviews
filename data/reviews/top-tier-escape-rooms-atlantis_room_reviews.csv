Our group had 2 enthusiasts and 2 first-timers, and the room kept us all engaged and properly challenged as we progressed. The design of the room is super cool and fun, and the puzzles are clever and unique. I would recommend this room for enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Can't wait to play the next room here!"

Atlantis is unique, provides challenge and ample enjoyment to go with it. Our group of 4 enthusiasts were impressed with what is cooking up here at this newly opened venue. Nothing better to see than quality rooms joining the community with humble and customer-first owners.  Keep up the good work looking forward to the bright future of Top Tier Escaperoom!"

It was very creative and well done! Our family really enjoyed it! It was just hard enough to make us all dig deep and exercise our minds! It was fun to see everyone using their strengths to find clues! Great fun!!
