"Escape room ""Y2K"" by Get Out: Omaha in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/get-out-omaha-y2k,0,"We tried the Y2K room and it was a very challenging and creative. Several in our group have tried the other two escape rooms in Omaha, and we found this one to be the most creative and challenging of the three. The staff was courteous, helpful, and I would highly recommend the room for any team or family event."
