"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Escape Redding in Redding",https://worldofescapes.com/redding/quests/escape-redding-prison-break,0,Just did the prison break escape and it exceeded my exceptions by far! This was my first escape room and it was extremely fun. The workers were great and I look forward to doing the others soon!

I haven't had that much fun in a long time. I recommend the jail room, it is extreme! The staff is so nice and they explain everything in detail. I felt like I really was in prison. Very cool. Iâ€™d give 10 stars if I could."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Escape Redding in Redding",https://worldofescapes.com/redding/quests/escape-redding-prison-break,2,"What a fabulous experience In Redding. None of our party had ever been to an escape room and we weren't sure what to expect, but the director put our minds at ease and gave us some fun hints for success. Our room was ""Prison Break"". The layout was so creative and accurate to how a jail might look. The director was in communication with hints which helped us through times we felt frozen. We actually got out with seconds to spare. Great price for a great experience."
