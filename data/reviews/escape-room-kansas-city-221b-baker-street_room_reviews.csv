"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Escape Room Kansas City in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/escape-room-kansas-city-221b-baker-street,0,"Great fun! I did the 221b Baker Street escape room with a group of 9 and would recommend it highly. I would also be less reluctant to get clues next time. We waited until almost the end before asking for a clue, and ended up missing one final step to be able to complete the puzzle."
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Escape Room Kansas City in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/escape-room-kansas-city-221b-baker-street,1,We had an absolute blast! We did the Sherlock Holmes room with a group of nine and two others joined us. I loved that everyone was able to participate and contribute at some point in the game. The only thing I think could be done better is a better explanation at the beginning. We only had one experienced person out of the 11 of us and if we didn't have her we would have no idea how to start. But we still absolutely loved it and will for sure be back!!

Did the Sherlock room. I came with my group for my birthday, 6 of us, and we had 2 more groups of 2 join us on our escape! We all did so well working together even though we just met. Our Game Master was pretty great as well. I will be back for the Terminator room (ha!)"

I've never done anything that was challenging that was enjoyable at the same time. The staff was amazing! The intercom was a little hard to hear unless you were right by it, but that's wasn't really a huge deal. So much fun! I will definitely be back to do more rooms!"
