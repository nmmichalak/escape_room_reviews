Our group really enjoyed the Steampunk challenge. There was careful attention to time period detail and a really cool atmosphere, down to the use of a soundtrack in the room!"

The rooms are designed by an engineer, everything is so creative! And they did not hold back on the decor and room setup. We have been to rooms that throw some sawdust and some fake blood on the floor and say ready go. Not here!The 1920s crazy inventor room was beautiful! And the clues were creative and challenging and so so fun! We will be back with friends!"
