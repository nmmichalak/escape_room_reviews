"Escape room ""The Lucky Duck Speakeasy"" by Xscape Our Rooms in St. Augustine",https://worldofescapes.com/st-augustine/quests/xscape-our-rooms-the-lucky-duck-speakeasy,0,Went with a group of friends and did the Speakeasy room. The puzzles are really great and they don't heavily rely on scavenger hunts so there was never a dull moment. We're definitely going back to do The Chamber!
