"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by Codescape in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/codescape-lucidity,2,Four of us completed the Deep Space challenge with 13 minutes remaining. This was my first time doing an escape room and was a blast. I look forward to doing more in the future! The staff was very friendly and even showed us the first room of other challenges since we were the last there in the evening. Keep the new rooms coming. We will definitely be back to Codescape!!!
