It was a nail biter to the end, making it out with only 16 seconds to spare. My group did the Locker room and it was challenging and required all of our combined effort.

Our group of 9 had a great time working together to solve the Locker Room puzzles. Everyone was engaged and played a part in our escape success. It was challenging and the mind bending puzzle promoted team work and outside the box thinking. We all had a part in our successful escape. The hints they gave along the way were thought promoting and helpful without being obvious. Martha, our ""hostage"" was a critical part of solving the puzzle. Our family thoroughly enjoyed the experience and we'll be back!"
