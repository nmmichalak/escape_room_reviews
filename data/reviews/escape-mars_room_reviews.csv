"Escape room ""Escape Mars"" by Escape Mars in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escape-mars,0,"Room was very cool in concept and design, but the puzzles/challenges fall very short. There was a very specific radio puzzle in the room that was insanely difficult and the margin for error was ridiculous. Two of the puzzles in the room weren't reset so once the door locked we ended up having 2 boxes open that weren't suppose to be. When this was brought the employee briefly apologized and that was the end of the conversation. There are very cool visual effects and hollywood effects that are placed in the room. "
