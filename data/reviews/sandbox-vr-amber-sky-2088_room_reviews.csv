"Escape room ""Amber Sky 2088 VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-amber-sky-2088,0,"We had my 10 year old nephews birthday, booking two sessions of Amber Sky and it was a blast!  Adults and kids all had fun, including grandma and grandpa!  Its pretty much a sci fi first person shooter, with team play... Two players are equipped with power shields that can block attacks and also be thrown like a boomerang, and laser pistols. The other 4 players carry laser rifles that also have a flamethrower... Theme is alien invasion... If your teammate gets damaged too much they shut down and you have to tap their shoulder to heal them and they can rejoin the battle.  If alien eggs are allowed to spawn they may jump on you and start biting your chest and your teammate needs to shoot them to get them off, but you can kick the eggs to break them or hit them with the flame throwers... A fun team tactic: give the kids the shield to block, and adult stands behind them with a rifle to shoot overtop of the shield! :)"

We had an amazing time!!! The green screen room becomes so realistic once the game starts. And the staff is so friendly and helpful! I can't wait to go back. Plus they give you highlight videos!!
"Escape room ""Amber Sky 2088 VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-amber-sky-2088,2,I brought my 9 year old and his friends for my son's birthday. He had a great time. We did Amber Sky and my son loved the experience. I would say this is bit pricy. I could have taken kids to Great America all day for the same price. This was a 30 minute long game so I hope they would lower the price to attract more people.
