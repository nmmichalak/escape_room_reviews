We split our team of 14 into two teams of seven for the Haunted House and Pirate's Revenge rooms. Both teams were within 30 seconds of solving the rooms! SO CLOSE! The staff was fantastic and booking was easy. Definitely recommend for either a team building or fun event.

"Escape room ""Pirate’s Revenge"" by Escape Frenzy in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-frenzy-pirates-revenge,3,This was our first time in an escape room and we loved it. We were a little nervous at first but the monitor in the room did an outstanding job helping us through the room whenever we got stuck on something. The puzzles and clues are challenging but fun! We did the Pirates Room with just me and my wife and we made it out with 1:47 to spare. Give it a try!
