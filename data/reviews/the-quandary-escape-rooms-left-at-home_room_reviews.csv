It was tough to escape but we managed with two minutes to spare. Great customer service and they even provided clues if we got stuck. I would highly recommend and we will be coming back."
"Escape room ""Left at Home"" by The Quandary Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/the-quandary-escape-rooms-left-at-home,1,Great escape room. It has lots of fun Easter egg references throughout adding to the overall experience. The puzzles were tough enough to give a thrill when they were solved yet still solvable. Really enjoyed the entire experience!

We knew a Home Alone themed escape room would be a good time, but it definitely exceeded all of our expectations. We look forward to coming back for the escape the 90s room!"
