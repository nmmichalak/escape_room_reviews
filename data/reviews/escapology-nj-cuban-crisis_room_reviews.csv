"Escape room ""Scooby-Doo"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-cuban-crisis,1,This was such a great experience! I went here with a group of 6 to do an escape room for my birthday and we were in for a good time. The persons who greeted us were nice and cordial and explained some of the process to us. The entirety of the experience in one word? ORGANIZED. They really take pride in that and it's visible. We did the Cuban Crisis mission and enjoyed ourselves and made it out with less than ten minutes to spare. I would go back

We did the Cuban Crisis Game Master John and Game Host Ally were awesome.  They have a great party room too.  Owners were fabulous to work with in scheduling.  Can't say enough great things about Escapology Garwood!
