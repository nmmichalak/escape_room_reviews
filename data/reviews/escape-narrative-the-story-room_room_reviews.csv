"Escape room ""The Story Room"" by Escape Narrative in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-narrative-the-story-room,0,This escape room was much different then others. It required real life thinking and problem solving. It was super fun and interactive. Was definitely well thought out. Would highly recommend!

Six of us decided to try this for entertainment and it was great. Not just going around a room and finding keys. We had to think, use clues, use a computer, put puzzles together and search as a team. The owner was just great and very nice. Explained everything very well. Exciting and thought provoking."
"Escape room ""The Story Room"" by Escape Narrative in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-narrative-the-story-room,2,I have done a bunch of escape rooms across the US but this was the best experience! I loved how we were part of the story and used modern technology to solve the mystery!!! Great time was had by all. My 18yr old nephew was a little freaked out but still had fun!!
