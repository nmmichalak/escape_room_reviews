"Escape room ""Magic Kingdom"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-magic-kingdom,0,"I highly recommend LA Maze Rooms for anyone who is looking for a good time with friends. This was my first room at this company and it did not disappoint! I went with a group of 6 and I felt like you can definitely do this room with a smaller group because it was a little tight for 6. This is a good room for beginners because the puzzles were not overly difficult. The production value of this room was phenomenal, as this is not your average keys and locks type of escape room. If you're looking for a beginner friendly escape room with high production value, then this is the room for you. "
