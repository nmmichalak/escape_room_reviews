"Escape room ""Boxed up"" by Komnata Quest in San Antonio",https://worldofescapes.com/san-antonio/quests/komnata-quest-san-antonio-boxed-up,0,"My husband and I tried the escape room where you have to escape from a box. It was tough but with communication and quick thinking, we made it! I can't tell you very much because I don't want to spoil the adventure but pay attention to every detail and our game master Yulia was amazing!"
"Escape room ""Boxed up"" by Komnata Quest in San Antonio",https://worldofescapes.com/san-antonio/quests/komnata-quest-san-antonio-boxed-up,1,"THIS WAS AMAZING! The Boxed Up game was really cool in that it didn't follow the norms of other escape rooms. Such a unique experience from start to finish. We've done a few escape rooms in the past, but this one was different. It's a rush from the minute you sign the waiver. I can't wait to go back for another room."
