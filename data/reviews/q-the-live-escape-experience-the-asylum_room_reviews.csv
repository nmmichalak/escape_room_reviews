It was challenging and it kept us on our toes. Nicole was our guide, and she was awesome (thanks for putting up with our stupid questions). I had a lot of fun, and the room was reasonably priced. Would go again in a heartbeat."

My husband and I did The Asylum while visiting Colorado last weekend. We had a lot of fun! This is a well thought out room. The design is visually interesting. It is also non-linear for the most part, which we prefer. The puzzles all work well within the storytelling. The owners are very nice. I wish we would've had time to play the other room here as well."

We did the Asylum room. The front desk/greeter/ ""Doctor"" was friendly, informative and helpful throughout the game. Whoever put these rooms together are very smart and creative! I'll admit that it was hard but having a leader, critical thinker(s), creative thinker(s), an organized team and hints from the Doctor helped us succeed. So much fun and would def recommend Q! Hope to go back again!"
