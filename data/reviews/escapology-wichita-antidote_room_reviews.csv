So I thought it would be easy, but believe me, it's really challenging, especially when your on a time limit. We were amazed at how well thought out this all was! There was actually 3 rooms in ours, to hunt for clues and try to solve finding the antidote. Was really well done, a lot of fun, and now we want to try the other rooms."
