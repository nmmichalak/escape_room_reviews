We escaped ""Crisis at 1600"" with a minute to spare. Our escape helper guy, Chandler, was an excellent host! And the rooms were full of challenging and fun puzzles. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a challenge."

Highly recommend taking the family and playing. We did escape both times, 1st time with 3 seconds left; second time with 13 minutes left second time. Will remember this vacation for a long time!"

Having only 3 people on our group made it difficult to spread tasks among the 3 of us. We left and immediately decided to sign up for another room the same day. Luckily we were paired up with 2 other players, and made it out of Crisis at 1600 with only 38 seconds to spare! The staff was highly enthusiastic, helpful, and encouraging. We had a blast! We have yet to stop talking about it. We would definitely return. I wish we had one in Maine! Great job."
