"Escape room ""Possessed Puppeteer"" by Cooperstown Escape Rooms in Cooperstown",https://worldofescapes.com/cooperstown/quests/cooperstown-escape-rooms-possessed-puppeteer,0,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing time solving the Possessed Puppeteer room. The decor of the room was phenomenal, and very detailed. The puzzle had several challenging, but also very fun, clues to solve. We also had a chance to talk to the owners after we solved the puzzle, and they were happy to answer our questions, as well as give us recommendations for other places to go. We weren't rushed out at all. The atmosphere was great. Overall we had a fantastic time, and will definitely be coming back anytime we visit Cooperstown. Definitely recommend going here!"
