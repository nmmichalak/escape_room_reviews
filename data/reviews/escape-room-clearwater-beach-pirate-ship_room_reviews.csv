This is a fantastic, fun place. I definitely would go back. Me and a couple others went for our first time and had a blast but we owe it all to a employee named Marcus. Marcus was a wonderful help and very nice . We did the pirate ship room and finished it, it was amazing. Thank u Marcus, next time we're in town, we will definitely come back."

These are 45 minute puzzles with different themes: zombie apocalypse, pirate ship, and alien uprising. My group did the pirate ship and we got out just under the wire. From what I heard of other groups, the alien room is very difficult and neither got out. I found the pirate ship to be good for all ages as it's all on one level, the puzzles are challenging but not too much, and there isn't a ton of chemical fog. There is low light so if you have any vision problems, that could be an issue. It's appointment only, so make sure you call to reserve your room!"
