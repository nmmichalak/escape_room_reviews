When the final door opened, we all said that was it, we're done? There weren't enough puzzles, a lot of what we had to do didn't really make sense and one of the clues wasn't working properly. It was fun, but should be done with a much smaller group. We had 8 people and it would maybe be more challenging with 3 or 4."
