Keesh was a great game master, very enthusiastic! Figured out the Murder Room with 2 minutes to spare. 2 of us had done escape rooms before, 3 were brand new. The newbies had a great time and are addicted now just like us. Canâ€™t wait to try the other rooms!"

The puzzles were challenging, but everyone was able to contribute. Once we got going we were able to make it through all of the clues and solve the murder mystery with 1:51 left on the clock. The host's hints were well-timed and needed to make it through. We will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""A Study in Murder"" by Bull City Escape in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/Bull-City-Escape-A-Study-in-Murder,2,A group of friends and I were looking for something different to do together. Someone suggested Bull City Escape and I am so glad she did. We had an absolute blast. We had so much fun trying to solve the clues and just as much fun thinking it through after our hour was up! I would highly recommend booking a spot and taking part in this awesome Bull City experience.
