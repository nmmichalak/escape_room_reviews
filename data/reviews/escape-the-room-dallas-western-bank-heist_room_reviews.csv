"Escape room ""Western Bank Heist"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-western-bank-heist,0,"The room had a great theme and we were very excited going into the experience. There was a very mixed reaction in our group for this escape room - some of our group really had fun, and others really didn't. I think what was hardest is that while there was clearly plenty to keep us engaged the full hour, there wasn't much to keep all 10 people in the room engaged that whole time, which resulted in several times where I stood there watching someone else do something or someone else stared at me. So, it has potential but a might benefit from a more experienced/friendlier/professional room operator and fewer people in the room at once."

The staff was very friendly (even offering additional hints from the prerecorded ones when my group got frustrated) and it was a great experience! My group (5 people in the bank heist room) finished with just under 10 minutes left, and we all left feeling very satisfied with the amount we were challenged! Hints were really helpful without giving away everything immediately, and everything worked/opened as it was supposed to! I will definitely be back to Escape the Room with my friends again!"

This was our first escape room, so we didn't know what to expect but the experience far exceeded our expectations! Our clue master was lots of fun and seemed to enjoy working as much as we enjoyed the escape room."
