"Escape room ""Time Warp"" by Time Escape in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/time-escape-seattle-time-warp,0,"I did two of the rooms: “Time Warp” and “Presidential Assassination”.In no way can they be compared, I wasn’t able to solve the time warp theme but absolutely loved it and decided to come back to try another one. The hi tech, interactive puzzle and the thrill of adventure was amazing!The president room was OK, but was not very fun. Some of the puzzles felt like a hassle and not very inspiring to solve. I could find these type of puzzles online.I’d still recommend this place though!"
