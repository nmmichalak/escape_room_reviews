I have been to quite a few escape rooms and I have to say this establishment has been the best so far. I have been to this location twice since it’s open to play The Heist and Gold Rush and my friends and I were able to escape both. I can’t wait to come back and collect more cool t-shirts!"

This staff will bend over backwards to make sure you enjoy your time in their rooms! It is absolutely clear that this group of employees is close knit and well managed. Each personality shines in it's own way, adding to the fun of each visit! These are some of the best rooms available. We've played escape games in at least five major cities and after having played 'Heist, Gold Rush, and Spec Ops' these are some of the best!! The sheer ingenuity of each room is astounding! We were challenged in ways we'd never before seen in a room. If you're seriously considering taking up the escape room challenge, do yourself and a favor and book here! It may be just a bit more expensive than other places, but it is ABSOLUTELY worth it.Again, thank you to Zach, Josh, Courtney, and Brianna for making our experience fantastic! Trust and believe we'll be back with reinforcements to take on Prison Break!"

Even the business as a whole is just nice, modern, and so well put together. My crew played Heist and we were able to make it out. The puzzles were amazing and I cannot wait to come back and experience the other rooms."

I am lucky to have friends that enjoy escape rooms, and we've tried them all over the city.  (Undefeated!)  I must say The Escape Game Atlanta was a lot of fun.  We did The Heist.  The whole thing was very professionally put together.  Very clever puzzles.  Very clean presentation.  Fun story line.  And staff was very helpful and friendly.  I wouldn't mind going back to try the other rooms.  Holler if you're coming with."
