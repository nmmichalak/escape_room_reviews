"Escape room ""The Pharaoh's Curse"" by The Hidden Passage in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-hidden-passage-the-pharaohs-curse,0,"We have a few escape rooms under our belt now and this Pharaoh room was really fun and clever. Well decorated, puzzles and locks took a minute to figure out, but we always like when the gamekeeper is fun too! Yea Ben! Good for a medium size team."

Rooms are hugeI love the pharaoh storyline, just make sure it's just your group that's going in with you obviously it's easier to work together but if you don't mind playing with strangers than it should be great"
"Escape room ""The Pharaoh's Curse"" by The Hidden Passage in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-hidden-passage-the-pharaohs-curse,2,"Wow! Just WOW! This was my 114th escape room, so I am not easily impressed. I've done half the rooms in LA, and this one really holds it's own. The set design and building were amazing. You go to an industrial area not expecting much, and then you walk through their doors and low and behold you are transported to Egypt. The game and puzzles were incredibly fun and my team had a blast escaping The Pharaoh's Curse. The attention to detail and immersive nature of this escape room were impressive. I'd recommend this game to any escape room expert or newb."
