"Escape room ""All In"" by Escape Chambers in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/escape-chambers-all-In,0,"Our group of 9 did All In. It was a blast! Challenging enough that it wasn't easy to figure out, but not so hard that it was discouraging. We will be back!"
"Escape room ""All In"" by Escape Chambers in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/escape-chambers-all-In,1,"My family did this as part of our Christmas time celebration and everyone loved it! We did the “All in” scenario, which was fun because all 9 of us could do one room together. The “hints” were very straightforward, it might have made it more fun/challenging if they made the hints more like riddles or something, but they saved us from wasting a bunch of time going over old stuff when there was just something simple we missed, so it was fine. I’ll probably go back sometime, my wife and I were talking about how great is was the rest of the night!"

Our game master was amazing. Will definitely be back for another room or laser tag."
