"Escape room ""Villains"" by Fuzzy Logic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fuzzy-logic-escape-room-villains,0,We had a group of 7 with most having little or no escape room experience so it was difficult but we made out in time. We were in the Villains room. I would recommend Fuzzy Logic.
"Escape room ""Villains"" by Fuzzy Logic Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/fuzzy-logic-escape-room-villains,1,I took my husband for his birthday to Fuzzy Logic and this was our first time here. We did the Villains room and it was great! It was so much fun! We had a group of 8 people and managed to escape in time! Juliette was a great game master! I world definitely recommend to anyone looking for some fun!!! Very friendly staff and when we were done we got to write our names on the wall!!! It was such a blast! I will be back to try the other rooms!!! Iâ€™m hooked!!!
