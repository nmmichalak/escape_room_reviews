"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by Bust Out Escape Room in Albuquerque",https://worldofescapes.com/albuquerque/quests/abq-xcape-room-da-vincis-secret,1,"Took the family to try the new Da Vinci's secret room. We all had a lot of fun and loved the theme. The puzzles were challenging but fun for the whole family. Beat it with a few minutes to spare. We will definitely be going back to try their other rooms. Thanks for making this room, it's a great theme!"
