"Escape room ""Quarantined"" by Legendary Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/legendary-escape-rooms-quarantined,0,We had a group of 6 do the Quarantined room and it definitely wasn't your typical escape room. The hour flew by and the added zombie in the rooms definitely added to the intensity. Would highly recommend and look forward to trying the other room!

Great time and well run.

Also was with the group that made it with 30 seconds left in Quarantine. Pretty fun would do it again, the players we were grouped with were very nice everyone worked together and the zombie adds some fun and gore.Staff was helpful with some clues, good time!!!"

We thought we hadn't done very well only to learn we were only the 3rd team to complete the challenges and escape the room in a while! Great job guys!"
