"Escape room ""ESC Key"" by Game the Room in Rohnert Park",https://worldofescapes.com/rohnert-park/quests/game-the-room-esc-key,1,"Amazing! As an escape room veteran, I've probably done at least 10 rooms, both of the rooms here were incredible. Both were extremely well designed in terms of the cleverness of the puzzles. ESC Room's puzzles were harder then Skelaton Key's."

Started with Skeleton Key and enjoyed it so much, we stayed for ESC Key... Still stuck in the land of C.O.L.I.N., we have to admit. Such nice proprietors, great puzzles and very immersive. We will be sure to send others your way! Thanks much!"
