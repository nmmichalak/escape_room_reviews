"Escape room ""The Honky Tonk"" by Beach Escape Game in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/Beach-Escape-Game-The-Honky-Tonk,0,"Meh, It's ok. This is your standard small escape room. Some of the puzzles were unique. There was one I particularly enjoyed, it dealt with a magnet on a stick. Having done countless games this one is low on my list. There are no surprises here but you will probably enjoy it. Not recommend for enthusiasts like myself."
