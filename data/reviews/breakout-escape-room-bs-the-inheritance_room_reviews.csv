"Escape room ""The Inheritance"" by Brainstorm Escape Room Bonita Springs in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/breakout-escape-room-bs-the-inheritance,1,Trying to retrieve our inheritance from our aunt was unsuccessful (the room we played was called The Inheritance) but the process doing it was great! We all had a blast looking for clues and trying to solve the room. I highly recommend Brainstorm Escape Room for an hour of fun being locked in a room with your friends or family. The owner was so nice and really helped us to have a great experience.

It was extremely challenging but fun trying! We were glad they offered clues to help us along the way. We would definitely return to try another room.
