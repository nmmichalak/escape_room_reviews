We has reserved a certain time, but were assigned with a large party that was so rude and obnoxious, the nice guys working assigned us to the later time. Our group then was super fun and very friendly. It definitely works your brain and makes you work as a team! Pretty difficult, but a lot of fun. We did escape."

What an awesome time we had trying to solve all the puzzles and riddles. Our room monitor Bailey was so helpful, you can tell she really loves what she does:) As we were walking out of the building, everyone was asking when can we come back again to try another room!!!"
