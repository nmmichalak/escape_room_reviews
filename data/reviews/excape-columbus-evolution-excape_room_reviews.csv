"Escape room ""Edison's Secret Lab"" by EXcape Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/excape-columbus-evolution-excape,0,"Just finished the Evolution Room for our anniversary and all I can say is WOW! Our first time doing one of these rooms, we had 4 of us in the room and it was the perfect size group. The puzzles were interactive, challenging, but solveable. We made it to the last clue to the last number before time was up. We were sooo close!! But that just means we have to come back. Highly recommend this to anyone interested in an escape room!"
