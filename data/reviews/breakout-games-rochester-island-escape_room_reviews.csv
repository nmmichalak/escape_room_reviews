"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Rochester in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/breakout-games-rochester-island-escape,0,I went with a team of teens and we aced this room. Lots of fun decor and interesting interactive bits. It was one of our favorites.
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Rochester in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/breakout-games-rochester-island-escape,1,We recently visited Breakout for the third time. We did Island Adventure this time. It was our favorite room so far. We have also done Casino and Hostage. Jenny was our host and she was great! Breakout is so fun for a group—adults and kids alike! Our teen daughter and a group of her friends did Museum Heist while we did Island Adventure with our 12 year old son and his friend. We all broke out! We can’t wait to go back.

It was very intense ,we had some help from our gamemaster Sky. We made it out under the wire with 30seconds left in our adventure. We were not handcuffed or blindfolded. our group ranged from ages 20's to 60's. Tip park on north side of building to take elevator up to venue."

We were celebrating my brother's birthday and solved it with 22 seconds left. Our Game Master McKenna was wonderful! She was just the right amount of helpful and such a fun person to have in the room. In fact, we had so much fun that I'm rating it 5 stars although I do have to warn others about the parking - the building is one thing, but the room is kind of difficult to find inside. There aren't a lot of signs so just go to the address and look for the elevator inside."
