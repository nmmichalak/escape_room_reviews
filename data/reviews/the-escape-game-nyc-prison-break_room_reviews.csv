"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-prison-break,0,"This was my 13th escape room, 5th from the Escape Game. The first three were in Chicago, 4th in Austin, and this one was no disappointment. My husband's first experience with TEG, Prison Break was a lot of fun. We ended up with two other couples, but it turns out, we definitely benefited from the extra help. We started separated in two cells and had to work together a bit to escape our first rooms. I won't get into too much detail beyond that, but I am always beyond impressed with TEG's production and attention to detail. They have a great balance of clues and misdirections. They are super prompt with their clue giving when you request it. You can take advantage of 3 clues, but if you need more they would be able to offer you some. We escaped with 90 seconds to spare. It was a blast- highly recommend it. Conveniently located midtown."

Three of us had never played while our other two family members had played. The staff were friendly and helpful. We had so much fun with the Gold rush room, we also played the Prison Break room. It was my daughters 19th birthday and after the prison break room, all the staff had signed a birthday card for her.Thank you for a great time."

An immersive experience that will you have you lost in the scenery all while challenging yourself in more aspect than one in order to make your way out the room in the hour given. Whether I played with a friend or a party I had just met that day, it brought out the best skills of everybody involved. My favorite room had to be the Prison Break room where the players of the game are split into two different cells and had to communicate by describing what each other saw in their cells. My biggest tips would be to work as a team and be vocal! Overall a great experience!! Will definitely be back to play the games I haven't had to chance to yet!"
