"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/The-Escape-Game-Gold-Rush,1,Absolutely LOVED the experience! Our team of 3 tried to escape Gold Rush and ALMOST made it. You can't go anywhere else and do something like this. I will be back.

What a great way to celebrate my 30th birthday; being a kid again! I won't give anything away, but Gold Rush was awesome! Can't wait to go back."

"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/The-Escape-Game-Gold-Rush,4,This was one of the most fun things I've ever done!!!! It was extremely challenging and I would think most everyone would enjoy it. We escaped with 1 min 15 seconds left and were jumping around in celebration.

(I don't count the one they charged us with because we had the thing, and lost it at the very end of the game.) Our group had so much fun solving puzzles and working together. We definitely felt more accomplished than we would have if we had stayed at the bar for another hour ;] I highly recommend this activity for people who like puzzles, trying new things, and building great teams/realtionships!"
