"Escape room ""Escape the Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-anaheim-escape-the-darkest-hour,0,"This place is amazing! We did a team building night in both rooms (one scary, one not) by Mission Escape with 8 people per room. The storylines are fantastic and the mechanics they use are like magic. This goes beyond just hunting for codes to open locks (although plenty of those too!), but they use great technology to make the experience completely immersive. They really want you to succeed, so the progressive storyline is enhanced by the tech to guide you where you need to go so you don't feel completely lost and stuck. And even if you do get stuck they give you just enough hint to get you where you need to go.We screamed, we laughed, we loved every minute!"
"Escape room ""Escape the Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-anaheim-escape-the-darkest-hour,1,"I have played a handful of escape rooms but this one was my wife's first time. And even though she was terrified of the Horror Theme for The Darkest Hour, she had an amazing experience. The game itself has a lot of unique and interesting puzzles. The whole game makes you think outside the box. It's a little difficult but if you bring a good sized group you all will have a lot of fun figuring out the clues for the escape."
"Escape room ""Escape the Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-anaheim-escape-the-darkest-hour,2,"Mission Escape and Joe (Masterful Game Master) have done it again! Brought a mixed group of experienced and inexperienced escapers to try out the new Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber. We were wowed, spooked, tricked, and then escaped. Great take on this kind of horror theme. Very cohesive puzzles and clever guides. Looking forward to more rooms by these guys!"

It was very creepy. The puzzles were thematic and we were able to get out with 2:13 seconds left. A few jump scares happened. It was good that my friend was an expert in these types of games cause I honestly felt lost. The workers were definitely impressed at the speed of our puzzle solving. Definitely good times!"
"Escape room ""Escape the Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-anaheim-escape-the-darkest-hour,4,"We have done both Hydeout and Darkest Hour by Mission Escapes and I can't say enough about the build quality, puzzle complexity, and amazing staff. Both stories are well thought out and immerse you from minute one. Darkest Hour was a little more simple (in my opinion) but the anticipation and thrilling nature force you to work a littlest more trepidatiously. The puzzles are innovative and unlike some of the puzzles I've seen before, the room is built to change music, lights, and mood of the room as you solve puzzles and progress. Joel was our puzzle master and he was amazing! Very engaging, a great conversationalist, and very supportive. Do yourself a favor and book this room, you'll have a blast!"
