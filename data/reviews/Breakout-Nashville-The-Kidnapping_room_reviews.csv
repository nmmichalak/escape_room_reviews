"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Nashville in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/Breakout-Nashville-The-Kidnapping,0,"Had a GREAT TIME being kidnapped. Brian was great, and we got away, even if it wasn't less than 50 minutes. The whole family was able to contribute and had a blast. It was very fun and challenging. Hoping we can do another room soon."

My dad and step mom are in town visiting and we wanted to do something different and decided to get kidnapped, lol! We had the best time and haven't stopped talking about it since we left. We can't wait to come back and do the other escapes and my parents have already looked on line for one in their state. HIGHLY recommend for a fun family or friend night out. You won't be disappointed!"

They broke a record for coming the closest to losing with only .63 seconds left on the clock when the door opened! Awesome experience and the staff at Breakout Nashville are excellent. Highly recommend!"

It was pretty engaging and the game master was friendly and made us feel welcome. However, we were IMMEDIATELY turned off when we arrived by the girl at the front desk. She barely even acknowledged that we had come in the door. There were times that we tried asking her questions and she actually ignored us!! She sat there twirling her hair and acted as if she didn't care about anything that was happening around her. Everyone in our group was really turned off by this and had very low expectations for the game following. Luckily, our game master made up for her poor customer service. Overall, this was a cool experience."
