"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,0,This room is definitely challenging. I went with a group of 6 and I felt like I wasn't doing anything in certain parts of this room because there was no space for me. I admit that some of the puzzles I could not figure out but luckily for me my teammates were really smart about this. I would recommend this room for anyone who is looking for a challenge because this room definitely got me thinking a lot.

This room is extremely challenging and sooooooo good. The puzzles felt really unique and the decor was top notch. Plus, if you finish under the time limit with 2 clues or less you get a prize. Sheryl was our game master and she was super helpful and nice. We will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,2,"Just did the Da Vinci room and it's excellent. The puzzles are very challenging but never unfair. Some of them are pretty ingenious and they all stuck with the theme very well. Basically if you want to feel like Tom Hanks in the Da Vinci Code but without the awkward mullet, this is the place to go. I did this with 6 other experienced escapees and we still got out right at the 75 minute mark (or so the game master Sheryl tells us. She definitely played up the drama and was very helpful overall). I'm looking forward to trying the two other rooms at this location."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,3,I recently did the Da Vinci room with my friends and it was easily one of the best rooms I've ever done.  I thought the 75 minutes might feel too long but it was perfect considering the huge amounts of amazing/difficult puzzles which perfectly fit the theme of the room. Sheryl was definitely one of the best game masters I've ever had at any escape room I've been to.
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,4,"This is a beautiful room but it is really hard. Since the puzzles are so different, it took us some time to understand what to do. We spent a lot of times on puzzles we thought we could solve faster. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to get through this but there are plenty of others who have finished this room within that time frame. We had a group of 6 and when time ran out we were told we still had a few more puzzles to complete. Even though I am salty about the loss, I still highly recommend this room to the seasoned escape room goer."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,5,"We have done about a dozen escape rooms (from 60out as well as a couple other companies) and this is honestly the hardest room that I have ever done. The room had tons of unique puzzles, not just lock and key. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to solve all of the puzzles. Even though we got tons of hints we were unable to escape. Despite this, we still had a lot of fun. I would recommend Da Vinci for escape room pros and bigger groups (maybe 4-6 people) so that each person can work on different puzzles at the same time."
