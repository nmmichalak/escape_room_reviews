"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Study"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Square-Room-Escape-harry-potter-room,1,My friends took me here for my Bachelor's Party and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. We took the Harry Potter challenge and I was amazed at the level of detail and the sheer brilliance of the clues and their hiding places. I'm scared of revealing too much but my favorite clues were the deceptively easy ones (clues that looked easy but were surprisingly difficult). I have one suggestion: I recommend putting out a poll or suggestion box for different rooms so that you guys can get more ideas for future room themes (My suggestions for a potential theme are a Sherlock Holmes or Clue theme). I can't wait for the next room change and I highly recommend it to people who want to play with friends or clubs who are looking to build teamwork! ORDER OF THE PHOENIX FOR LIFE!

The front desk thought we were scared/shocked because of how loud we were all screaming and cheering. I had no expectations going in but have to say that my teammates and I enjoyed the Harry Potter room in particular to the nth degree! It was absolutely iiiiiiiiincredible! Quit being such a muggle and get over there!!!

"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Study"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Square-Room-Escape-harry-potter-room,6,"This is a great way to have fun with a group of friends! I'm not someone who typically enjoys puzzles, riddles, games, etc., but Square Room Escape has really elevated the experience for me. This is an excellent alternative for when you're looking for something to do and want a different option than going to the movies/bowling/karaoke. The clues are never the same, the rooms are beautifully decorated, and the whole thing from start to finish is very immersive. Definitely go check it out!"
"Escape room ""Sorcerer's Study"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Square-Room-Escape-harry-potter-room,7,I had so much fun with the Harry Potter escape room. This was my fourth escape challenge and I had so much difficulty. Without the hints I would not have solved it but I liked how we all could work together. I don't want to give it away bur great theme and design. Thanks for everything!
