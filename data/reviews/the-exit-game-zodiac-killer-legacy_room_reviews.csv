"Escape room ""Zodiac Killer: Legacy"" by The Exit Game in San Antonio",https://worldofescapes.com/san-antonio/quests/the-exit-game-zodiac-killer-legacy,2,Did the Zodiac room. Challenging but not so hard that it leads to frustration. Made it out with 8 minutes to spare. Clues were helpful but not so easy that it gave away the problem. Had clues to spare. Will be back.
