"Escape room ""Dracula: The Final Hour"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/room-escape-los-angeles-dracula,0,"My team and I came out here to try Dracula, after hearing it is an original game created by the owner of the location, and we couldn't be more impressed. The set design, puzzles, immersion was on point. Perfect game for a max of 4-6 people. I would definitely recommend it to everyone!"

First time doing an escape room at this location and will def be back. The Dracula room is difficult, very well designed and beautiful. Not your average escape room. They do help you if you need it and even if you're a seasoned vet of escape rooms you're gonna have a great time. Thank you!!!"

Dope GM for Dracula and Zombie lab! Loved the rooms especially Dracula! I loved the ending to it and the room itself wasn't super easy either.
