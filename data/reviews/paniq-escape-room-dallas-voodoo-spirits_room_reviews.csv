Didn't quite manage to solve the voodoo spirits room, but made it pretty far. Ammon was a great spiritual guide, and I would come back in a heartbeat."
"Escape room ""Voodoo Spirits"" by PanIQ Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/paniq-escape-room-dallas-voodoo-spirits,2,"This was my 5th room to escape; we signed up on a whim one night after work. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, and the uniqueness of their puzzles. This room contained a few dexterity-based puzzles which I hadn't seen before, and made for a new experience. The puzzles all make sense, and tie into the theme really well. Our hosts, Adrienn and Jason, were friendly and attentive. We escaped with 25 minutes left (partly because I sneakily figured out a puzzle with actually solving the clue...but that's ALL on me!) After we escaped, Adrienn gave us a sneak peak at the zombie room - we are definitely planning to return and attempt the other 2 rooms!"
