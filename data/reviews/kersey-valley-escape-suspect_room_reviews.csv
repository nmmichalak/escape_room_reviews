I would definitely go again!!! We did suspect which was superhard. But we are determined to go back and beat it! I give it 5 stars! And Mary was awesome!

"Escape room ""Suspect"" by Kersey Valley Escape in Archdale",https://worldofescapes.com/archdale/quests/kersey-valley-escape-suspect,2,Had such a great time! We did the haunted manor with another group and we made it out with 9min to spare. Our game master jen was super helpful. We also did the suspect room just with our group and that one was a little bit harder. It was still really fun and our game master Mary was helpful as well! We definitely want to go back to do the autopsy room and try some of the outdoor activities like laser tag and zip lining ( it was raining that day) Highly recommend checking this place out!!
