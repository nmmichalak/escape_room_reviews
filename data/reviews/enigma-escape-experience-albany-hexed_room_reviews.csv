"Escape room ""Hexed"" by Enigma Escape Experience in Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/salem/quests/enigma-escape-experience-albany-hexed,0,This was the third escape room that we have experienced and thought that it was the best one so far. Loved the puzzles and there was a lot going on. Definitely a room you want to do with multiple people. We did it with four but would be just as much fun with six easily. A must do if you like the escape room idea.
"Escape room ""Hexed"" by Enigma Escape Experience in Salem",https://worldofescapes.com/salem/quests/enigma-escape-experience-albany-hexed,1,This is a great escape room full of secrets and fun experiences! The timing is perfect. It has a great storyline which takes you to the cosmos and beyond. Would highly recommend and would love to do it again so that I could experience a case of enigmatic deja vu!
