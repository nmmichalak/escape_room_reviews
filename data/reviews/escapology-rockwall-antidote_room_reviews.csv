"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Rockwall in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapology-rockwall-antidote,0,"We had a great time with my daughter and two grandsons (ages 10 & 13) - we chose the Antidote game because they had not done an escape room before. It’s the “easiest” game, but it wasn’t exactly easy. It was a wonderful challenge and a great intro to escape rooms. Our Host, Jazzlynn, was great, as was Ian, the Game Master. Everyone is excited to come back to do the other rooms. It is a bit pricey, but they gave prizes to each of us for escaping in less than 60 minutes, which included game cards for the arcade and a discount for a future game."
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Rockwall in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escapology-rockwall-antidote,1,I had a group of 6 teenage girls for the Antidote room and they had a great time. The staff was very patient with them (much needed with that many 13 year olds) and they made sure the girls understood all the clues and how to get started. Would definitely recommend this for family and teens.

She loves it, & there's wine!Our 13-year-old daughter also played Antidote as part of her birthday party. They couldn't stop talking about it when they came out."
