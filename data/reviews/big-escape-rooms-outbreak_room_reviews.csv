"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Big Escape Rooms in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/big-escape-rooms-outbreak,6,My friends and I had our very first Escape the Room game and we did the hardest difficulty mission which was Outbreak. I thought if I didn't finish the game I would feel really bummed out but I actually had an awesome time even though we didn't complete the room on our own! 10/10 fully intend to come back! And shoutout to Viola for giving us awesome hints!

"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Big Escape Rooms in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/big-escape-rooms-outbreak,10,"We did the Outbreak Room and solved it with a few minutes to spare. We lost a few minutes to a broken lock, but they were helpful when that happened. The room is the best I have seen- lots of real clues and not red herrings. I would not suggest this for your first experience, though. First-timers are overwhelmed by the pace and the complexity of the concept, so doing this room will be frustrating for some. I would also suggest getting a Groupon or other discount, as it can get expensive to do escape rooms without when you have a group of people. Lastly, we had 10 people- our group of 6 and 4 strangers. That was too many. I think a group of 6 would have been perfect. You simply can't strategize or communicate the way you need to when you can't hear or come up with a plan for who does what because of chaos. Overall, I would highly recommend this for experienced escape room fanatics and teams who work well together and can delegate."
