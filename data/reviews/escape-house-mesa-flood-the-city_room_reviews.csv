"Escape room ""Flood The City"" by Escape House Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-house-mesa-flood-the-city,0,"We played the room ""flood the city"" - it was very difficult! However we had the best time! It was a clean room, an intriguing and it kept us engaged the entire time. Brian helped us out with three clues and was great in setting the stage for the story! We'll definitely be back."
"Escape room ""Flood The City"" by Escape House Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-house-mesa-flood-the-city,1,"This was our first experience with an escape room and we had the most amazing time!  We decided to go as a family for my daughter's 16th birthday and we let her choose the room. She chose Flood the City because she said it sounded the most ""interesting.""  After booking the room, we realized it was also the most difficult, but we decided we were up for the challenge.  The staff here was also great!  Since we were newbies, he spent some time letting us know how it works and then went on to tell us the back story of our game. We were to discover the clues to unlock our door and to save the city from being flooded.  We were allowed 3 hints during our hour game, which we did use.  There were five of us and the game was definitely difficult but we escaped with only minutes to spare.  So much fun and we can't wait to return and try the other rooms!"
