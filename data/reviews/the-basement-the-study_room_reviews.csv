"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Basement in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-basement-the-study,0,"By far the most immersive room I’ve ever done.  Notice the only bad reviews are people butthurt they didn’t escape?  Most rooms make sure everyone gets out because they are afraid of bad reviews lmao. There needs to be more rooms like this that are actually hard instead of “You get three clues.  Oh, you’re out of clues, here let me give you more...”"

"Escape room ""The Study"" by The Basement in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/the-basement-the-study,7,"We did ""The Study"", and although it is considered to be chapter 2 in the Basement series, you can pass the rooms in any order you like. Now, the room was greatly decorated and well thought-out. We were a group of six which I think is a perfect number of players. I will be back for the original chapter 1 room!"
