"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-,0,"Such a fun activity for when you're looking for something different. We had a great time in the kidnapping room. If you don't want to have people in your game that you don't know, you'll need to find 8 people to fill the reservation, otherwise you risk being matched with people you don't know. We had 6 and 2 were added, luckily we all got along. The staff is friendly and our game master really added to the fun. Can't wait to go back to try another one!"

The puzzles were the perfect level of challenging for us and the room had a great pace. The theme was one of the creepiest rooms we have done, but that added to the fun. I would recommend this room to anyone looking to try out a blindfolded and handcuffed room. "

Our guide, Taylor, had a really fun personality and was very helpful! The escape itself was not too challenging and not too easy.  Definitely want to go back!"

Without giving anything away, I will tell you that this room was phenomenal. The clues make you think. You need to be resourceful. You need to work closely with your group and plan your time appropriately so that you don't run out of time. You have one hour to solve the puzzle.Ultimately we did not solve the puzzle in time, but we were close. Let me tell you, nothing makes you want to come back like being minutes away from success!"
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-,4,"Went here for a work team-building event. My team did ""The Kidnapping"" where you are blindfolded and handcuffed in the room. We had to solve multiple puzzles and put together lots of clues to finally exit the room. It was challenging and a team effort to complete! Much more intensive than I expected, but we managed to break out with 6 minutes left. The other two teams from our office also broke out of their respective rooms, so it's possible!"
