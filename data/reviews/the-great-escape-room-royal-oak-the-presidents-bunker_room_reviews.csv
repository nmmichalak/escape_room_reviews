"Escape room ""The President's Bunker"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-royal-oak-the-presidents-bunker,0,Had a wonderful experience. I was told The President's Bunker was one of the harder rooms but I enjoyed it. It was challenging but still fun and mentally stimulating. Andrew was a great host as well.

Our game master Chelsea was extremely nice and made the experience even better. Can't wait to go back!"
