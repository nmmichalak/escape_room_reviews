"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/breakout-games-tallahassee-the-kidnapping,0,"What an amazing experience! This is one of the few activities you can do that makes you not even think about your phone or social media. You are bonding, talking, laughing, and working together with your friends! We did The Kidnapping and it was so much fun! Jake was our game master and he was the best I’ve ever had! You must go try this out!"
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/breakout-games-tallahassee-the-kidnapping,1,"Went to the Kidnapping room with a group of friends. I especially appreciated this room because I'm a horror fan and it was like being part of a scary movie (without, like, the actual terrifying abduction and possible murder part, of course).Our guide Emily was awesome and you could tell that she has a theatre background because she was lively and helpful. She also wasn't annoying and patronizing. Would attempt an escape again for sure."
"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Tallahassee in Tallahassee",https://worldofescapes.com/tallahassee/quests/breakout-games-tallahassee-the-kidnapping,2,I was a bit nervous at first (being handcuffed and blindfolded) but that quickly changed as the “game” played out. Great team building and problem-solving adventure. Definitely doing this again!

I was in a room of 6 people, 4 of whom I didn't know and you would have thought we were long time friends by the end. I was in the kidnapping room and it took everyone working together to solve the mystery at 59:59 (whew). The staff was super friendly and helpful. Definitely will return."
