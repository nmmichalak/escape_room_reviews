"Escape room ""Wall Street Heist"" by Red Button Escape Games in Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/bend/quests/red-button-escape-games-wall-street-heist,0,"After having completed about 150 escape rooms coast to coast, I have found the bottom of the barrel ( to be honest there is a worse game in Washington DC and one in Jacksonville, Florida, but this is definitely  148th worst) .  Its always risky in a new town to play a room not reviewed by a trusted source, but sometimes you have to roll the $50.00 dice... and sometimes you bust!! This was one of those nights. My wife and I played their Wall Street room ( a room with 4 walls  and not much else), not even a way to communicate with your game master, who would randomly send messages via a TV screen, but who would not respond when I asked an actual question.  I can live with  a technology bare room with good puzzles, but this was not that room.  We crushed the first 99% of the room without pause, cruising though the  1 hour room in 35-40 min before coming to the final puzzle ( one we simply did not understand). We struggled for 15 mins before  finally asking for a push in the right direction. All we received in response to our request was dead air. With 2 mins left, having basically just sat there for 15 mins with no luck, our game-master ( and I use the term loosely) places this message on the screen:  ""a clue would ruin  the puzzle.""  In the end, we simply walked out of the game with 10 sec left to find an empty lobby. We showed ourselves   to the parking lot , licking our wounds and living to game another day.  WHO is this room for? ......People who enjoy being robbed, burning money to watch the pretty flames, or maybe close friends or family of the owners of Red Button!! Stay away- it's a waste of time and money."

A great back story to drive the excitement. This is a young company with a friendly and personable staff. We can't wait to see what they come up with as they grow.
