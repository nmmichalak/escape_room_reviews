"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Mission Manor in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/mission-manor-asylum,2,This was my first ever escape room and I couldn't have been happier to have this be my first. We did Asylum and had so much fun that we stayed and did Countdown right after! The staff was super friendly and our host was amazing. We'll definitely be back to do the third room!
