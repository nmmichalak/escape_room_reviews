"Escape room ""The Armory"" by City 13 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/city-13-the-armory,0,"A group of 5 of us visited City 13 and attempted the Armory. No one in the group had done an escape room, so we didn’t know what to expect. Our expectations about the entire visit were blown away by the staff, the room, the entire experience. The topic of conversation the rest of the night after our experience was the escape room. We all couldn’t stop talking about how much fun we had and how we can’t wait to go back!"
"Escape room ""The Armory"" by City 13 in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/city-13-the-armory,1,I had the pleasure of going through both the Armory and the Bank  at City 13 with my group of 6. Both rooms are super detailed with theatre style lighting and ambient noises playing in the background to set the mood. It definitely worked to get you immersed in the story. The puzzles themselves were challenging but all the clues to solve them were within the room. It was a great experience overall. Plus they have popcorn and a pool table in their lobby while you wait. 10/10 will visit again.
