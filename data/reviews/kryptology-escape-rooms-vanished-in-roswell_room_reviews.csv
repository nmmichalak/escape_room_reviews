Next time we're in the area we'll definitely stop by again. The room and props were well put together and the staffer that worked with our party was helpful, friendly, and kind!"
"Escape room ""Vanished in Roswell"" by Kryptology Escape Rooms in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/kryptology-escape-rooms-vanished-in-roswell,2,"My girlfriend and I are fairly seasoned at escape rooms, so we challenged their Roswell game and had a blast. The puzzles were clever, challenging-but-not-impossible, and blended well into the story. Our game master, Christian, was very helpful and gave our hints in a way that nudged us in the right direction w/o giving us the answers (precisely what you want in a good game master). Overall, it was a great experience and we look forward to coming back to challenge their other rooms!"

Both of the concepts and themes were well orchestrated and fun. We are avid escapees and thoroughly enjoyed our experience in the rooms. Kryptology had innovative escape techniques we hadn't prior experienced."
