"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - St. Louis in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/breakout-games-st-louis-operation-casino,0,"The facility was modern and clean. Friendly staff provided us with a prompt start. The game we played (Casino) was enjoyed by our entire family, with everybody able to contribute with clues and ideas, including our two 13 year-olds. While we didn't need much help, there was a point where we stalled and the young lady monitoring us remotely, stepped in with just the right level of clue to get us back on track. The next time we have the family all together again, we are going back."

Desk staff were helpful and nice. We had a great time, aided by Denny our game master who provided helpful clues along the way. Denny was also reassuring to our youngest team member that he wasn’t actually locked in and that there were clues available if we needed them. The room itself was good, although it was a bit of a rough start for us and we couldn’t figure out where to begin! Overall an awesome time and would recommend it to anyone!"

The gentleman who answered my questions on the phone was great and Katelyn who helped my group the night of was super fun. Thanks for helping my group have a great night!"
