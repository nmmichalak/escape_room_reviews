"Escape room ""The Inventor's Garage"" by Epic Escape Game in Grand Junction",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-junction/quests/epic-escape-game-the-hunted,0,This was a total blast! We went last night and completed the Hunted room with seven minutes to spare. We had the best time and cannot wait to go back and do more rooms! I would definitely recommend the Hunted Cabin room it was very well put together and was surprising you all the way to the end of how everything went together.
