"Escape room ""Weekend Get-AWAY"" by Sprightly Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/sprightly-escapes-weekend-get-away,0,"Sprightly Escapes rooms are fun, unique, and the perfect level of challenge. Lucas and Kelly are fantastic hosts and my entire family had such a great time together. We escaped with two seconds to spare! We all left our adventure talking about how much we can't wait to come back, and we definitely will return to Sprightly!"
"Escape room ""Weekend Get-AWAY"" by Sprightly Escapes in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/sprightly-escapes-weekend-get-away,1,Had 2 out-of-town visitors and needed something fun to do so we booked the later time for the Getaway room. There were 4 other people who joined. It was a blast! Way more fun than expected. It was not easy but after about 15 min you start getting the hang of it. We were soooo close to escaping..needed about 3 more minutes. Would be a great team building event. Will definitely do another room sometime.

It was a fun and unique way to spend time with my team. Some of us had done escape rooms before, others hadn't. Everyone had fun and would go again!"

We attempted the Weekend GetAWAY and were not disappointed. While we didn't escape, it was a great experience. We had no idea what to expect but our hosts explained the game very well and set us up for success as best they could without ruining the experience. They were very welcoming and friendly. I would highly recommend this as a fun activity for a small group. We will definitely be back to attempt the other room and hopefully make our way out! Thanks Sprightly Escapes!"

The owners and creators are onsite and involved, which is unusual in escape rooms. The Motel Room was perfectly designed; the clues and puzzles were challenging but we were able to make progress and feel satisfied. Highly recommended."

Walked in not knowing what to expect because this was my first escape room. Kara and Denise were amazing hosts and made the experience exciting. I don't want to give too much away about the ""weekend escape"" but it was challenging and fun!"
