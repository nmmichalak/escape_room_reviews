It was SO much fun! Todd is so welcoming and explains how everything works before you start. The rooms are decorated and the game is so creative! I have not laughed and had this much fun in a long time! Thank you Todd for such a wonderful memory with my friends and I!

Will definitely go back and try out the murder mystery one and the car one Todd told us about. Owner is a great host. Felt really excited throughout the whole hour. My coworkers and I beat the game with just barely a minute left. Best going away night with my team. Thanks Todd for this awesome memory!!!
