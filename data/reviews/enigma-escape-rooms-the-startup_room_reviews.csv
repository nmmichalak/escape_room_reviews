"Escape room ""The Startup"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-startup,0,Highly recommend this place; we escaped The Startup with 3:30 minutes left on the clock (with only four of us in the room). This was my 18th escape room and I can guarantee I'll be back for more.

We did ""The Startup"" challenge and had a really great time. It was really well put together and I am still amazed at the level of detail and thought that went into creating the experience. I HIGHLY recommend doing one of the enigma escape rooms. You won't be disappointed!"
"Escape room ""The Startup"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-startup,2,I went to Enigma with my team from work. We were in the startup room. It was very challenging but a lot of fun. I think we divided up tasks pretty well. We managed to finish only 5 minutes before the hour time limit but a least we finished.
