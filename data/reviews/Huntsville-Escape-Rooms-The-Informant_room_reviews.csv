"Escape room ""The Informant"" by Huntsville Escape Rooms in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/Huntsville-Escape-Rooms-The-Informant,3,I am from Bermuda and was in Huntsville for a training class. I couldn't wait to try an escape room As I had heard of them but never tried one before. Huntsville Escape rooms did not disappoint. My group had a blast and just missed getting out on the last clue. Our escape master was funny and quirky with his hints when we needed them. We did The Informant which was challenging but not too difficult. Wish we had time to try all four rooms. But will definitely find another one whenever I return to the states.
