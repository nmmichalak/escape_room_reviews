"Escape room ""Steampunk Gypsies"" by Escape Room Studios in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-studios-steampunk-gypsies,0,We did the Gypsy Steampunk room and we had an awesome time! The mobile trailer was really cool and the owners are extremely friendly and professional. I highly recommend this location to anyone and I would definitely go back.

The game master was very nice as well. It was a great bonding experience for all of us. If we would have had 20 seconds more time we would have made it out but didn't. Lol Thank you for the experience. I highly recommend this place. The puzzles and clues were amazing.
"Escape room ""Steampunk Gypsies"" by Escape Room Studios in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-room-studios-steampunk-gypsies,2,This was the best escape room we have been to. The scene was realistic and movie-like and there was a huge variety of puzzles and things to figure out. The others we have been to have been mostly lock boxes and combinations and keys but this one had many puzzles and interesting one of a kind set up on the wall. I dont want to spoil your experience with details but it was very cool! You will love it! We will be back when the next room opens!! Very happy with our experience and the Gamemaster was very nice. What a great time with our kids! Wonderful family activity!
