The room was scary and the puzzles were challenging. As escape room enthusiasts, we can say Eureka and it's staff definitely won't disappoint. Roy was great as our host, and we will be coming back to try the other rooms very soon! "

"Escape room ""The Haunting"" by Eureka Escape Games in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/eureka-escape-games-japanese-thriller,4,"The room wasnt bad at all. Our group was able to navigate pretty well. The only problem was our guy, Steven, who overslept our appointment by 2 hours and had no idea what we were doing in our escape room. The 1 hint we asked for, he was completely unaware of what task we were on. When we finally managed to break out, we had to radio him that we he had done so. He was unaware that we had finished.The wizard room we did was pretty fun. We all enjoyed waving our wands around and looking for clues in the strange symbols and breaking locks. 9/10 would recommend with different host."

We didn't get out, but we had a lot of fun trying to work out the clues. Our guide Terrance was fun, friendly and helpful. It was challenging, you really need to work together, and pay a lot of attention to details, but try not to over think it! I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to get together to do something unique and fun with family or friends."
