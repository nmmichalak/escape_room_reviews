"Escape room ""Sherlock Solution"" by House of Conundrum in Omaha",https://worldofescapes.com/omaha/quests/house-of-conundrum-sherlock-solution,0,Had a great time in the Sherlock Room! There were so many intricate puzzles that all of us had something to look into without getting overwhelmed by everyone trying to figure out one puzzle at a time. Totally recommend it for small or large groups!
