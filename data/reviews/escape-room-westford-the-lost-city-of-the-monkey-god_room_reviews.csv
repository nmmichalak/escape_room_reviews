"Escape room ""The Lost City of the Monkey God"" by Escape Room Westford in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-room-westford-the-lost-city-of-the-monkey-god,0,"This was our second visit. The room we chose was Lost City of the Monkey God. We went with our adult children, 6 of us in all, and we were the only ones on this adventure. The puzzles were intriguing with just the right amount of difficulty. We finished with only minutes to spare! The room is big enough with enough puzzles that people can split up and work on different things but small enough that you always know what's going on so you don't miss any of the action. We all had a great time and can't wait to go back for another adventure!"

We did the Lost City of the Monkey God. We finished with a little time to spare. The puzzles were challenging and forced us to work as a team. This is the coolest escape room we've done so far. Everyone had a blast!

We had a great time and met a group of four experiencing this as their first room ever. We're looking forward to returning and trying the other room hopefully soon.
