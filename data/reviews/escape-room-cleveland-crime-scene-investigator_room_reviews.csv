"Escape room ""Crime Scene Investigator (CSI)"" by Escape Room Cleveland in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-room-cleveland-crime-scene-investigator,0,"Great activity for family, friends, or co-workers.  You can have groups up to 10 per room.  We had 9 in our group, and although it was a bit chaotic, I'm not sure that we would've been able to solve the mystery without help from every one of the team members.Our group did the CSI crime room, which was rated at a medium level. Having participated in one escape room before, I would say this is an appropriate rating for the difficulty level. The workers were friendly and gave you good instructions. Contrary to another escape room I went to, there was not a worker in the room with your group.  Whenever you decided you needed a clue, you all gave thumbs up to the security cameras, and a clue would appear on the screen for you.This was the first time many in our group participated in an escape room, and they all said they would do it again.  Escape rooms are fun; however, I will warn you that if you are doing one with your family, anxiety and emotions can be heightened, so I hope that you are all able to take a deep breath at the end and laugh about it all :)  if so, your group will have as much fun as we did!"

Six of took on the CSI room and it was excellent - lots of teamwork needed, definitely challenging but doable! We had a blast."

Now that I know how things work, I think I'll have a better time on my next visit and I definitely would love to go back soon."
