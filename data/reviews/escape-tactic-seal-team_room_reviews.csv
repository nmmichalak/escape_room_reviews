"Escape room ""SEAL Team"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-seal-team,0,The Seal room was hard. It was super fun though!! We almost made finished it with 3 locks left to open. Definitely recommend going with more people.
"Escape room ""SEAL Team"" by Escape Tactic in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/escape-tactic-seal-team,1,"This was my first trip to an Escape Room.  We were a group of eight, ages 14 through 75.  We completed the Seal Room for my nephews 14th Birthday.  And a good time was had by all!My sister selected the most difficult room, but with our game master...  The fabulous Tyler who will be henceforth referred to as ""T-Man,"" guided our group with humor, sensibility and unlimited hints which I was very happy to get.  The place is big and immaculate.   The reception area is a cozy welcoming spot where they introduce their stellar staff, and then they run down the rules, and set the tone for an hour of active teamwork, thinking outside the box and most of all fun!  Also check in on Yelp for an exclusive code which entitles you to an extra 15 minutes to complete the challenge.We were the final tour on this unseasonably, warm Sunday night in early December.  We capped off our good time with photos using mini chalkboards to document this unique, challenging and super engaging experience."

It was a lot of fun though and the guy supervising our game was super helpful and encouraging. 10/10 recommend. Iâ€™ll definitely be back."
