"Escape room ""Room Amnesia"" by QQuest Escape Games in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/qquest-escape-rooms-amnesia,6,It is the most the most magical thing in the whole wide world I love it so much. The puzzles are always interesting and it's so funny the the simple things u will over think that solve the puzzles. The people who work there are also very nice and I've already tried 3 of their rooms and just want to do all of them. I think they r better than other escape the rooms I've seen and I love how they have more than one room. Altogether an amazing escape the room!
