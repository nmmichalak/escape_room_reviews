"Escape room ""Arizona Sunshine VR"" by 13th Gate Escape in Baton Rouge",https://worldofescapes.com/baton-rouge/quests/13th-gate-escape-arizona-sunshine,0,"The VR feels like you have been thrown right into a video game. Our game master Emma was extremely helpful, the place is extremely clean; there are board games to play while you wait.(although there was not one) I 100% recommend the VR and will try their escape rooms soon."
