Lots of good puzzles and a great atmosphere - you're trying to get out before the sun sets, which adds a level of tension as you can see it going down. We will definitely be back to try all the other rooms!"

A perfect way that to spend a evening with your friends and family solving puzzles to escape Dracula's lair. This was all our first time doing something like this and now we are hooked. We highly recommend this place"
