"Escape room ""The Grove"" by Brain Busters Escape Rooms in Daleville",https://worldofescapes.com/daleville/quests/brain-busters-escape-rooms-the-grove,0,Wonderful staff. You can tell that everyone really loves their jobs. Super friendly and very professional. Great price for such a well done room. Will highly recommend anyone here. Team building days are amazing. The owners are wonderful people. Very helpful. I would give 10 stars if i could. I have played other places but for this price you cant beat them.. I would choose them over anyone else in the wiregrass area. I will be back.
"Escape room ""The Grove"" by Brain Busters Escape Rooms in Daleville",https://worldofescapes.com/daleville/quests/brain-busters-escape-rooms-the-grove,1,We where Driving by And seen the SIgn Glad we Stopped. The Staff was Nice and the Place is inside  A Magic Shop too!  The Price was Cheaper than Expected for the Room. We Failed to get out in 60min but the owner let us Play out the Game and 8 mins later We left the Room. It was Fun and all the Props and  Games Looked Build by the Owner but all Was FUn to Solve.it is upstairs that's the ONLY bad  Part about this Place. We will be Back to Play the Other Rooms for sure
