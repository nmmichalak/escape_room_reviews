"Escape room ""Temple Escape"" by Shipwrecked in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/shipwrecked-temple-escape,0,Very entertaining and mindtwisting place! Pretty tricky to say the least. Addicting also-we could not stop after one room!

Staff at the Escape Room were fun and helpful (mini golf girl less-so), and the Indiana Jones-style room was well done. Would like to try the other rooms in the future!"

This off-the-grid spot is well worth the Uber ride from the subway. Food and drinks are very reasonably priced, and the mini golf and escape rooms are awesome."
