We were celebrating our son-in-law's birthday.  We are both 69 and 70 and found the challenge stimulating.

"Escape room ""Bunker 57"" by Alternate Reality Escape Rooms in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/alternate-reality-escape-rooms-bunker-57,5,We have never been in an escape room before and now we are addicted! We loved them so much we did rooms only a couple of days apart. We first did the Piece Meal (failed) and it was amazing. It had cool special effects which i did not expect. Then we did the Bunker 57 and it was even better (we made it!). Bunker for me was more of a team effort and unusual. We all loved it!! Staff was very nice and helpful. I can't wait to try the next one. I have nothing negative to say. Great experience.
