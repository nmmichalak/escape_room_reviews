Even though we got buried alive but it was so fun. We almost beat it. The staff was extremely friendly and pleasant not only to us but to my mother and sister while they waited for us. We are going back tomorrow to try a different one. It's truly a must do.

We did the Aztec adventure which is the easiest since we have never done one before. The game was really fun and had us all working together and working hard. We beat it at the very end just barely. The staff was very nice, the facility was clean and beautiful, the set was fun and engaging. We really loved it and are planning to return during our visit so we can try another adventure!"
