"Escape room ""The Show Must Go On"" by Clues and Gumshoes in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clues-and-gumshoes-the-show-must-go-on,0,"Awesome place! My husband and I started with The Show Must Go On; it seriously felt like we had just walked backstage in an actual theatre when we entered the room (and I'm a stage manager IRL). It was a blast! The four rooms' storylines are all interconnected, which is a fantastic element; we're definitely looking forward to going back and doing the rest! Plus the owner, Brian, is SUPER nice."
