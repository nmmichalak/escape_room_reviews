"Escape room ""The San Andreas Earthquake Experience"" by Clueology Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/clueology-rooms-the-san-andreas-earthquake-experience,0,"Went with a group of friends to the Earthquake room and I had a blast! The puzzles were neat, it needed a lot of collaboration and overall, was a great experience. I absolutely need to do Alcatraz, the story for that is so neat!"
