We split into two groups and tried both the Mayan Experience and the Bunker Room. Both groups managed to escape! These high school kids had fun and learned to work together!!

It wasn't exactly what I expected but it turned out to be better! Everyone was able to participate and helped figure out different clues. That was really fun! I would definitely recommend this game to family and friends!
