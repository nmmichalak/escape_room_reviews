"Escape room ""The Wizard's Lair"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escapism-portland-the-the-wizards-lair,0,"My wife and I have done more escape rooms than we can count all over the country and across the world. Although we often share positive experiences with friends, we rarely (shame on us) take the time to write a review. The wizard’s apprentice Ryan was such a fantastic host that I was inspired to change that. His approach to setting the scene and preparing us for the room started from the moment he opened the door to let us in the building. His character and story telling ability set this escape room experience apart from the many others that we have done. The room did not disappoint. Although we were close, we did not escape, but it was not a frustrating experience because it wasn’t impossible, no faulty equipment or technology, and very logical connections between puzzles and solutions. The story line was carried throughout and by the end I was believing in magic. Thank you Ryan for a memorable experience."

"Escape room ""The Wizard's Lair"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escapism-portland-the-the-wizards-lair,3,We played the wizard lairs room and had such a great time. The Wizard (Ryan) did an amazing job! The puzzles were very thought provoking and just overall had that wow factor. As a fellow escape room owner I would highly recommend Escapism to anyone that played our room and was looking to have another escape room experience. Well done!

I loved it so much, I might go do it again with a smaller group since my friends figured out certain puzzles while I was focused on other parts of the room. Definitely doing all the other rooms as soon as I can. Also, props for incorporating science into the puzzles and having an actor to immerse you"
