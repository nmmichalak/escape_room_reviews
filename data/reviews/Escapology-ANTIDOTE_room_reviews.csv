"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-antidote,0,Was our first time doing an escape room and it was great. Not sure I would have got out if not for my trusty sidekicks. Did Antidote and would do another one for sure. Place and staff were nice.

This was the first escape room for all but my daughter in college. The place was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. The 4 of us made it through with 8 minutes left. A little squabbling, but most families with Mom, dad and two teenage girls will have that!We will be back to try another room in the future."

They really put a lot of thought in detail, starting from the guest area and ending with the rooms. Antidote was probably my favorite since it was very technological and challenging. The Code is a solid contender. Hope they open new rooms soon!"
