As a fellow escape room owner (and enthusiast) and having played games all over the country, I can say that this place is the best ER in St Louis. Clever puzzles, strong game flow and solid use of tech. We did the Diamond Heist and Castle (set the record in Castle) and had a great time."

We had a blast! Two out of our three groups escaped in time. It was great team-building, as everyone contributed and worked together. We did the Diamond Heist, the Castle, and the Cardinals room and they were all well-liked. The girls talked all the way home about how they want to do it again!"
