"Escape room ""Shooters Saloon"" by Code Breakers Escape and Puzzle Rooms in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/code-breakers-shooters-saloon,0,"Tried our very first escape room. Loved it! Friendly staff, good storyline, nice decor, and reasonable prices. We completed the ""Shooters"" room, which would also be appropriate for kids who love puzzles (probably 10 and up). No scare, just lots of puzzles and brainpower! We'll definitely be back!"
