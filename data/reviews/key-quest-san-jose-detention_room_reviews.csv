"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/key-quest-san-jose-detention,0,"This experience was very disappointing. This takes place in a room that must be 10 feet by 8 feet, door closed, lights out. There was no real point, no rhyme or reason to it, etc. Not at ALL like other escape rooms we have seen/experienced. We had our family of 5 there, ages 16 to 74, and we all agreed that it was a complete waste of time. Laser Quest is clearly just trying to make extra money with one of their unused small rooms, without really providing any ""experience"" at all. The employee checking us in was super nice, but the experience was terrible.Do NOT waste your money or your time !"
