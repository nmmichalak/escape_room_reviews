"Escape room ""Locked! at the Bistro!"" by Unlocked! Escape Rooms in Andover",https://worldofescapes.com/andover/quests/unlocked-escape-rooms-locked-at-the-bistro,0,We did the Bistro room and had an awesome time. Our group of 8 all were able to contribute to the experience and we left beyond excited. It was great having a challenging and worthy escape room experience so close to home. Thank you Carl for a great experience. Highly recommend for a night out.
