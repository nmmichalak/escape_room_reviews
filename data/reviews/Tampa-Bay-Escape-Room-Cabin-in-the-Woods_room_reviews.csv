"Escape room ""Cabin in the Woods"" by Tampa Bay Escape Room in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/Tampa-Bay-Escape-Room-Cabin-in-the-Woods,0,We did The Cabin in the Woods room as our family Christmas together outing and made it out just before time ran out. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The clues in the room were fun and we had several aha moments. The clues we received when we asked for help were just right. We will definitely go again and recommend it to others.

As soon as it started I realized that this was going to be awesome! We started out on a great pace and even our host said he thought we were going to beat the fastest time, but we got stuck on something so easy that we overlooked. We eventually got out with about 6 or 7 minutes to spare. We all had a great time and were talking about it for the rest of the day. We will definitely be back to try the kidnapped one next!"
