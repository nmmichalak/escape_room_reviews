"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Last Minute Escape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/last-minute-escape-the-submarine,0,We just finished the Submarine Room in Montclair. We're a family of 2 adults and 2 kids (9 and 12). The room was challenging but we made it just in time. It's very well done and we all loved it. You really need to bring multiple clues from different areas together in this one to be able to move on and get out. You also really have to work together in order to be successful. Afterwards the guy who ran it was available to answer all our questions. We recommend this room by all means!

They are always so kind and helpful. The Submarine honestly challenged us more than any of the previous experiences but every room is a lot of fun and worth every penny!
