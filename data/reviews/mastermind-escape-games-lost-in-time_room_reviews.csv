We were successful and had time to spare. I highy recommend taking the challenge!

It was definitely a challenge but we managed to escape with 2 seconds left lol. Will definitely do this again and will recommend to others!!

We took a group of 10, ages 13-42. We did the Lost in Time Room. It was a challenging but so much fun!!! We escaped with 20 minutes left on the clock. Everyone split up and we had people working on multiple clues at once. The benefit of QR scan clues is a brilliant idea, we took advantage of that twice. We will definitely be back!!!"
