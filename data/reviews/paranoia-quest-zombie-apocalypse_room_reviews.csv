"Escape room ""Enchanted Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-zombie-apocalypse,0,I went with a group of 5 to Wonderland with TJ as our guide. He was amazing and made the experience very fun! 
"Escape room ""Enchanted Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-zombie-apocalypse,1,"This was my second escape room and it was very well done. It was not too difficult to the point where it felt impossible, but was defintely difficult enough to have to use hints. Tj was our gamemaster and did an amazing job with the introduction, hints, and overall game experience."
"Escape room ""Enchanted Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-zombie-apocalypse,2,This was my first ever Escape the Room challenge. And we escaped! After paranoia Quest Atlanta couple others and paranoia Quest is definitely at the top of the chart if you haven't tried it definitely put it on your bucket list
"Escape room ""Enchanted Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-zombie-apocalypse,3,"We are vacationing in Georgia and love doing escape rooms wherever we go, and we have to rank Paranoia Quest as one of the top contenders. The two of us did the Zombie Apocalypse room with another couple that we did not know. First of all, just walking into the building you can tell that they put a lot of thought into the design, the lobby was cool, and they had puzzles for you to do while you waited. Obviously I can't give much away about the room itself, but the attention they put into decorations was great. I've been to a few escape rooms that were fun, but they were really just a plain room with puzzles in it.In the end we got out around 55 minutes! This is the first time we've done one with people we didn't know, but it was really no different, and we had just as much fun and got to meet some new people. Would definitely go back!"

We came in to Atlanta for a short time and seen this opportunity for something to do while we were here, so so glad we took the time to do this!  We had a great time with the people we were paired with and truly had an enjoyable time!  It was a bit hard,  teamwork is definitely the key.  Staff was awesome as well.  If you have time and looking for some fun and brain stimulation this is the place to go for sure!  Will be back paranoia quest. ...will be back! :)"
"Escape room ""Enchanted Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-zombie-apocalypse,5,"Some of the clues weren't put back after the group before us, so when we tried to follow the clues, we were confused and had to call back a few times. Never got an apology for it. I would do it again, but I would ask if the clues are all in place before you begin. "
