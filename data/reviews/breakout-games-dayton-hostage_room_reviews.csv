"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-hostage,0,This was our first visit to Breakout Dayton. We did the “Hostage” room and had a blast. We had a great time and go out with 18 seconds left! Allie was our game master and she was great. If you haven’t gone...go. If you have... go again!

We were only 2 people and we did the Hostage, we got out in 56 minutes and 9 seconds and our game master was Gauh (I think, the pen stopped working as he was writing his name). He was amazing! He gave us the clues we needed in order to help us figure it out and they weren't too vague nor too specific! Magnificent!"

My group of coworkers and I had soo much fun and we beat it with about 3 minutes remaining. It was a great team bonding experience and Sarah was so funny. I highly recommend Daytonians to visit Breakout and enjoy a fun and challenging game!

We did the Hostage room. It was our first experience of this kind. We did not make it out in time, but Ryan was super nice and helpful."
