"Escape room "" Captive"" by Twisted Exit in Lancaster (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/lancaster-ca/quests/twisted-exit-jigsaw,0,"LOVED THIS!!!! This was my boyfriend and I's first escape room. The lighting/mood and decor were so well done that I had a panic attack in the hallway, hahah no joke. It was great though, once we got in the room and got going on the clues we were okay. We did not Escape, but were told that we were 3 locks from escaping. Overall GREAT ROOM!"
