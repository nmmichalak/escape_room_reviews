"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-hostage,0,"I had done one escape room experience in Alexandria, VA and then tried this one, the rooms here are smaller and less decorated but this place is more challenging to get out. We broke out of the kidnapping room but not the hostage room."

Very clean place, well organized, and very welcoming. I have been to many escape rooms and this was one of the best! Staff was extremely friendly! We did the Hostage room with 6 people (which was a perfect amount) and it was fun! I liked the fun start with handcuffs and blindfold. That was different and really got you more into the story. The room fit into the story well and had some great and unique clues. Highly recommend! We will definitely be back."

"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Baltimore in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/breakout-games-baltimore-hostage,3,We did the Hostage room and had a blast! I would say that any more than 5-6 would be too many. There would be people standing around doing nothing. We loved it and would definitely do it again!

The room was quite challenging, but not impossible, and we escaped! Would definitely recommend this room."
