The game master was sociable, while not over talkative. He welcomed us as soon as he saw us pull in the driveway, welcoming us into the building and allowing us time to put our possessions away. We immediately started on our large room. I was with one other person and we got through about 75% of the way through the room. This room was definitely one of the most challenging, considering we've done almost 40 escape rooms, so I would not recommend this room to a new escape artist."
