"Escape room ""Lost Pyramid"" by Memphis Escape Rooms in Memphis",https://worldofescapes.com/memphis/quests/memphis-escape-rooms-lost-pyramid,0,"Our group of 4 couples (a quadruple date!) decided to book this room immediately after finishing another room at the same location because this location is so fun. This escape room is amazingly submersive with the massive amount of detail in decor, lighting, sound effects, and awesome detail. The room is great for large groups. There is a fair amount of teamwork required to solve clues, mainly via communication. So- bring your communication A-game! There are a few aspects of this room that will be difficult or impossible for some people with physical ability limitations. Our group loved the surprises and the Wow-factor moments of this room. The puzzles are a tad more difficult than other rooms. Low-lighting in this room did affect some members of our group. Our group had a great time, and many members of our group declared this room their absolute favorite. The staff at the location were wonderful. They were eager, upbeat, welcoming, and very engaging.
