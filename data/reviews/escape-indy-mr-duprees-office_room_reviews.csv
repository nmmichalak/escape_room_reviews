"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-mr-duprees-office,0,"I visited here with the boyfriend yesterday to celebrate our two year anniversary. They were very friendly, and kept you going with mystery and a sense of danger as an agent. We did Mr. Durpee's Office and our game master was very helpful yet not too helpful. We will definitely be back to do another mission"

"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-mr-duprees-office,2,Our group had a great time at Escape INDY. The majority of us had never done an escape experience and Mr. Dupree's Office was perfect for us. We escaped with just under 3 minutes to spare. I can't wait to go back and try one of their other scenarios.

We did Dr. Dupree's and it was very challenging yet we had a blast! We had a group of 10 and made it out with only 2 minutes to spare! Thank you Escape Indy, we'll definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Mr. Dupree’s Office"" by Escape Indy in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-indy-mr-duprees-office,4,"I was one of the first ones to visit Escape Indy right when they opened. I played the Mr. Dupree's Office. Great for first timers. Everything you need is contained inside the room, which is how things should be in my opinion. The subtleness of some clues were surprisingly fun as well. Overall, I felt that not only was this escape well thought out and had enough going on for our group of ten to stay relatively busy for almost an hour, but the difficulty involved was a perfect fit for first timers. You would be doing yourself a disservice by not making this the first escape room you do."
