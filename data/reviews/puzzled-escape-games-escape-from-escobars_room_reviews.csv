Escape from Escobar had a few things I've never seen, even a 'whoa!' moment. It's a pretty immersive room, you can tell they put a lot of time into building and designing the room and puzzles. It can take up to eight but I think 5-6 would be ideal."

The puzzles were challenging and required problem solving and teamwork. We didn't manage to escape, but I can't wait to go back and try again!"

Just when you think you're close to solving the quest, you realize there's more, a lot more! We used our clues and managed to sneak out with 40 seconds to spare. Will definitely go back for another puzzle room and would recommend it to all."

I was worried about the fact that our group of four was going to be paired up with another group of four, but it wasn't a problem at all. The story and setting are immersive but never once did I feel scared or anxious (even when handcuffed to the wall) so I could really focus on the puzzles. Our group had an amazing time and escaped Escobar's with one minute to spare! I can't wait to go back and do the other room!"
"Escape room ""Escape from Escobar's"" by Puzzled Escape Games in Easthampton",https://worldofescapes.com/easthampton/quests/puzzled-escape-games-escape-from-escobars,5,"We just completed the Escobar room. This was my first time doing a puzzle room and it completely exceeded my expectations. It was challenging, engaging, surprising, nerve racking and a ton of fun. The puzzles are really clever, and you never knew what was coming next. Can't wait to go back for the Occult Room. This was a totally unique way to spend some time with close friends. I could not recommend it more."
