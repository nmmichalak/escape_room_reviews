I went with one other person and we joined it some other group and had a great time. Our game master, Bella, was awesome!  Plan on coming back with my company for the team building value."

This was our second room at this location. We were greeted warmly by Eulissa and our gamemaster, Barrington. This room was very challenging and lots of fun. There were a few new puzzles and a few surprises as well. Barrington worked hard to keep us focused. (Thx, Barrington!) We were laughing and having a great time in this room, and the only frustration was that we didn't finish in time. There was plenty for everyone to do and never a dull moment. The puzzles flowed well. The room was clean and uncluttered (at least before we got into it!) I would recommend this business to locals and travelers alike."

We put on our cowboy hats and bandanas ready to do some bank robbin'! The puzzles were fun and just challenging enough. I like playing original puzzles not seen in other rooms, and there are plenty!  It takes a lot of team effort to complete. We did get out with about 14 minutes to spare!  Yee Haw!"

We took advantage of the current Groupon offer for the Wild West themed room and got paired with another group of 4 for a total of 8 participants.Luna from Can You Rob The Bank did an awesome job explaining the room's dynamics and provided great support while we were in the room (we only needed to ask for help once!). The puzzles were challenging and the end-to-end process challenging and interactive for a group of 8.I am very happy with the escape room and plan to be back to try one of the other rooms! I would definitely recommend Can You Rob The Bank."
