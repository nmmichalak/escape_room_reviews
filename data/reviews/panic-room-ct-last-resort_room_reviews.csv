"Escape room ""Last Resort"" by Panic Room CT in Stamford",https://worldofescapes.com/stamford/quests/panic-room-ct-last-resort,1,"We had a really great time in the Last Resort. It was our first time and it was very difficult but through teamwork, we figured it out and escaped with less than 2 minutes to go. The staff was excellent and we would come back again for a different room."
