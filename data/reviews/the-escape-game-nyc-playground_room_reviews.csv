"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-playground,0,I’ve done a ton of these and this room exceeded them all! I’ve done Playground and Gold Rush here and they are both excellent. Come ready to think and explore- but absolutely COME!!! You won’t be disappointed:)
"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game New York in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/the-escape-game-nyc-playground,1,My group did Playground. We are veteran escape room players. Absolutely loved the production value of this room. The puzzles were all unique and fun. I finished but wanted it to keep going. One of the best rooms I have ever done.

Nerves got the best of me, but the TEG team instantly eased my worries. Their warm and inviting smiles made it easy for me to loosen up. We chose the playground room, and it was the perfect choice! All the colors, puzzles and games brought me back in time. The setting of the room makes it hard to believe you are not actually in a classroom. A lot of thought went into crafting such a cool room. It was fun to be a kid again!"

The staff was amazing and complementary. Sam was our clue master and she was excellent. Playground was so much fun for a family with kids. Our twins 6 yrs old were able to be helpful for most of the room, and had things to do if they lost interest in clue solving. A variety of clues kept us entertained, and the setting and theme were so connected. It was rated 6/10 difficulty, and I found it both difficult and yet sensible. We purchased a bunch of gift cards afterward for 20% off to come back and do the other rooms."

I really liked how they made you work together. Loved the elementary school flavor, and the board at the front of the room that does a great job keeping you motivated. We only needed a few hints and since we made it with 2 minutes to spare. Can't wait to try the rest of the rooms!"
