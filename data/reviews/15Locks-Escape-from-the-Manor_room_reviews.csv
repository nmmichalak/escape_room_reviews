"Escape room ""Escape the Manor"" by 15 Locks in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/15Locks-Escape-from-the-Manor,1,"15 Locks is an unassuming location with surprisingly high production values. We ran through The Manor, which gave our small group a good challenge with plenty of surprises.I'll definitely be returning to 15 Locks."

Great service, owners are fantastic; we'll be back to tackle the other rooms. Escape from the Manor was really challenging and well done. And we beat the clock! Highly recommend."
"Escape room ""Escape the Manor"" by 15 Locks in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/15Locks-Escape-from-the-Manor,4,"We have done two of the three rooms. We have done The Manor and Frequency. Both of these rooms are well themed and innovative. We left feeling like the rooms were challenging, but also feeling accomplished. All the hints/clues weren't so easy you can get them without thought, but weren't impossible to solve either. They give clues while you are in the room to help assist you with solving some of puzzles and guide you to the next one, if needed.The staff there was friendly and helpful. Before you go in the room, you can look and play around with various different locks. I highly recommending doing this, so you know just how to use each different lock (who knew there were so many types!). You will have a debrief with the staff just before entering the room where you can ask any questions that you have.The best part is that they will walk you through any unsolved puzzles once your time is up, that way you know how much more you had to go and what was left. This allows you to see how close you were to the end.I definitely think this is a great room whether you have been to an Escape Room before or if it is your first time.(Note: The Manor isn't really a ""scary"" escape room theme... I was a little concerned because I don't like haunted houses, but I did not have an issue)"
