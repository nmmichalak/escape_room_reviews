"Escape room ""Pawn Shop"" by ESCAPE:chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-chandler-pawn-shop,0,"I've been to a couple of escape rooms, and really I've been lucky enough to have a great time at all of them, and this one is no exception.  I did their ""Pawn Shop"" room, which was lots of fun and I would consider pretty difficult - but in fairness most of the difficulty came from us overthinking the problems.  ;)  It's run by a husband and wife that are very passionate about it - and even go so far as to make the different gadgets in the rooms - any place that casually mentions doing things with Arduino's gets an automatic bonus from me.Overall a great location and a great place to take a date, family or company to do something a bit more memorable an interactive than just going out for drinks or a movie.  Can't wait to go try their next one..."

It was my first time at an escape room. The owners were a blast and really made the night fun. We did the Pawn shop room and barely made it out with seconds to spare. We can't wait to go back!
