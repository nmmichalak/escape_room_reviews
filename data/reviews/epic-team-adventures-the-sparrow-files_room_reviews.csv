"Escape room ""The Peking Dragon"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-sparrow-files,0,"I love going to escape rooms - I have been to several both in Seattle and other locations and I have to say that Epic Team Adventures did an amazing job with their room, it was one of the best I have ever done!The story behind the room was highly engaging and tied in very well with the puzzles and clues we had to solve. I was in a group of four and throughout the entire game we were all scampering around solving puzzles and shouting out help to each other.The puzzles themselves were unique and while they varied in difficulty, all were designed in new ways I hadn't seen before, and forced you to think in new and engaging ways that I had never thought of before.All in all it was very well done and I would highly recommend anyone and everyone to go!"

Unlike some escape room with lots of puzzles, this one tells us a story and involves pictures, letters, moving objects, and sound. We finally made it and we all love the game! Will def recommend this place!"
"Escape room ""The Peking Dragon"" by Epic Team Adventures in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/epic-team-adventures-the-sparrow-files,2,My husband and I make it a point to do one or two escape rooms whenever we travel. We've done about 20 or so at this point.Booking online was really easy.We did the Sparrow Files room first (Peking Dragon) and it exceeded our expectations. Automation was great and the storyline really made sense and added to the overall experience. The room was really polished. I would say this room was doable with two people; I wouldn't recommend more than four.
