"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Can You Escape? LI in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/can-you-escape-li-the-prison-break,3,I had a great time. I went in knowing nothing about this this type of place. It was me and 9 other very competent people and we did not escape. We did however get to the last possible step on the interrogation room and didn't figure out the last bit of the puzzle and were furious when we found the solution. Highly recommend. I give props to the idea

Erica, our Escape host was super accommodating. She let us hide a couple presents in advance, so that the birthday girl could be surprised during the experience. The prison was difficult but very fun. Everyone had a great time & the staff was friendly, helpful. Can't wait to go back and escape again. Thank you "
