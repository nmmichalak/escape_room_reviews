"Escape room ""Speakeasy"" by EscapeQuest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapequest-speakeasy,0,"My group of 4 did the Speakeasy room and it was amazing! My family and I have attempted to escape many rooms in the area and this room has so far been our favorite! I HIGHLY recommend that you attempt these rooms if you love a good challenge, fun energy, and amazing room design. 10/10 will be back to try the Tiki Island next! Amazing work and thank you to the owners!"

The Speakeasy room was fun and challenging, but not overwhelming. The game master makes sure you don't stray too far off task, but doesn't make it easy either. Would definitely do again."
"Escape room ""Speakeasy"" by EscapeQuest in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapequest-speakeasy,2,Incredible! The thought and creativity of the Speakeasy room was mind-blowing! What a challenge. They are great at making sure you are not overthinking it and keeping you on track. Highly recommend!
