"Escape room ""Dr. Watson’s Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Great-Escape-Room-The-Infirmary,0,"Great experience! I went with my teenage daughter and her friends. We did the Infirmary. It was very challenging. We didn't get out in time, so our patient died. The surgery was cool. I definitely want to come back again. I would like to try the library, I heard it's pretty cool."

The Surgery room was super challenging but we had a blast, managing to escape with just about a minute to spare. Eduardo was fantastic! He was very charismatic and helped make our experience extremely enjoyable."
"Escape room ""Dr. Watson’s Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Great-Escape-Room-The-Infirmary,3,We recently did the Infirmary room and it was so much fun! We only had four people in the room working on solving the puzzles so it was super challenging. We ended up not escaping in time but were told it was a hard room and it's best done with 8 people. What a cool concept. Clues were hidden in places you never would have looked or places you did look and just past right over them. It was quite the adventure. We solved all the puzzles but one before time ran out. We are hooked and want to do more. A great way to spend a few hours with friends. I would definitely recommend.

It was our first experience in this type of game. In hindsight, we probably shouldn't have chosen a room with only an 18% success rate for our first time! Audrey was our guide and she was awesome. She has a great personality, was funny and helpful, and played the part well.I'm amazed at the level of detail and immense thought that went into designing the room and its puzzles! We didn't escape in time, so our patient died. Whoops! Regardless, I'm hooked and can't wait to go again. "
