"Escape room ""Dr. Watson's Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-infirmary,0,What a great idea & a lot of fun we had. Definitely going back to try the other rooms. Great for a few people or a group (but not too big)
"Escape room ""Dr. Watson's Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-infirmary,1,"We had a great time for my son's 11th birthday. We had mostly 10-13 year old children with my wife and I but we were able to solve the clues with a little help from our clue master and get out in time. This is a really fun time for the family which allows you to use your problem solving skills and it always helps to have several peoples perspectives on how to approach a puzzle. Overall, we were very satisfied with the experience as we knew what to expect. You are locked in a room, you must find clues and put them all together to solve puzzles and once completed you will have the code to escape. GOOD LUCK!!!"
"Escape room ""Dr. Watson's Infirmary"" by The Great Escape Room in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/the-great-escape-room-the-infirmary,2,It was a very interesting time. The room clues are a little bit out of wack but a good time was had by all. The attendant was so helpful and nice! Makes you feel like you are in place of secrets from the moment you are escorted in. Please remember to put on your thinking caps because if not you are in for a bumpy ride!
