I was so excited and we picked The Casino Operation. It was not easy but thrilling and kept us on the edge of toes. I love how you really have to use critical thinking skills to solve it. We had such a good time. I recommend all to do it. We used a group on that is good Monday through Thursday only. Unfortunately, we did not escape but I can't wait to do it again."
