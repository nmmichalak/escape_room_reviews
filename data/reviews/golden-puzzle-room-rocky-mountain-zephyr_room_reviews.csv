"Escape room ""Rocky Mountain Zephyr"" by Golden Puzzle Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/golden-puzzle-room-rocky-mountain-zephyr,0,"Our group of 4 adults escaped the Rocky Mountain Zephyr in Lakewood in a bit over an hour. The manager went above and beyond the one hour time limit by letting us stay an extra 10 minutes to solve every puzzle. No one was waiting on us so that didn't affect any other customers but he stayed late himself to make sure we were happy. Because of course we wouldn't take any clues! He said that they help manage people's time with clues when he knows they won't escape on time. I loved that he let us have more time to solve it without help. The puzzles ranged in difficulty level widely which I think is great because I don't want anyone to get bored but I also don't want anyone to feel stupid, ha! It was hands on, it was solvable working in one group, multiple small groups or individuals with each puzzle so it's a great time without worrying about personality conflicts. So as a team building exercise, a workshop to discover the strengths and weakness of groups, or just for fun, it definitely works! Loved it! Thank you!"

We loved Rocky Mountain Zephyr so much, that we came back an hour later and did The Nightingale - great variety of puzzles and challenges that kept us on our toes the whole time...such a great experience for all of us!"

It was a challenging and very well put together room. The staff was very welcoming, we will certainly be back to attempt the second room! Would definitely recommend The Golden puzzle room."
