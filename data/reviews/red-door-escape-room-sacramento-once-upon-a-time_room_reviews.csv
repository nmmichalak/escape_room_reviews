"Escape room ""Once Upon A Time"" by Red Door Escape Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/red-door-escape-room-sacramento-once-upon-a-time,0,The room we did here was called Once Upon a Time. We really liked it. We were a group of five. We finished with just about 25 minutes left and thought it was a little quicker than we thought. The mechanics on the room was really impressive too. The doors popping opens were fun to watch. I'm looking forward to going back and trying another room.

We did once upon a time it was so much fun! We will definitely return to do another escape room!  It's a nice location with restaurants surrounding it.
