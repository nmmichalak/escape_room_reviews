It was so much fun and our kids loved the kids escape room, The Kings Treasure. Us moms did the Cells room which was amazing and just kept surprising us...biggest escape room I've ever seen! I loved that our kids could do their own room while the moms had their own fun. We will be going back and I plan to have a group outing there soon!"
