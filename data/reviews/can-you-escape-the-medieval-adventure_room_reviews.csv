All of them were totally engrossing, exciting and lots of fun! My favorite one so far is the medieval room. Office had too much math for me and London was hard!!' Haha.

We got out with 3 minutes remaining. Great team building exercise and lots of laughs. The staff Adriana and Ian were very helpful and knew just when to offer us some clues. We canâ€™t wait to go again!

The staff were super friendly. I recommend Can you Escape? for a small or large group. I will be back to visit London or the Zombie (if my daughter can talk me into it). :)
