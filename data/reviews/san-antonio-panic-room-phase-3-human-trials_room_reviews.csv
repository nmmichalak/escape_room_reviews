"Escape room ""Phase III: Human Trials"" by San Antonio Panic Room in San Antonio",https://worldofescapes.com/san-antonio/quests/san-antonio-panic-room-phase-3-human-trials,0,Our team had such a great time in the Phase III Human Trials room! The puzzles and clues were creative and engaging. They had such a great set-up that must have taken so much time and ingenuity to prepare. We made it out of there with 1:17 to spare! We will be doing another room with SA Panic Room soon!
