Great set design, a nice mix of tech and non-tech puzzles. The room is beatable with just 2 people and I appreciate that they do private bookings. We'll be back to try their other room soon!"
"Escape room ""Apartment 408"" by Crimson Key in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/crimson-key-apartment-408,1,We recently completed Apartment 408 with 2 people and had a blast. It was a well designed room with some unique and interesting puzzles. You can tell a lot of time was put into the design and details of the room. We can wait to come back and try the classroom themed one!

The puzzles and the plot were very clever and the atmosphere is set so well! I really recommend doing this one!After we finished we had a nice chat with the owner who told us about some other locations to check out, which are definitely up our alley as well. Thanks again!"
