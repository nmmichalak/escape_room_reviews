"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Clue IQ in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/clue-iq-excalibur,1,"This place is legit. Easily the best game in the area holds up against some of my favorite ones I have played in bigger cities like Chicago and LA. Real props not just a bunch of cheap plastic toys and puzzles that actually make sense for the story. The talking knight was a lot of fun, we got hints just to chit chat with him. Talked to the owner, clearly passionate about making cool games. Highly  recommend. "

The room had great decor that really reflected the theme, and all of the puzzles were creative and varied. The staff was also very friendly and enthusiastic. My only suggestion is to add a few more puzzles to make the room a little more challenging. We will definitely return to do another room here."

My cousins and I have done escape the rooms in Philly, Richmond and Fairfax multiple times. This place was one of our favorites. We did ""Excalibur"" and the room was set so you felt like you were in a medieval time period. The puzzles were challenging and well thought out. There were also fun things thrown in that made the experience more interesting! Furthermore, the staff is very kind and the establishment is very clean and put together! Will definitely go back to complete the other rooms!"
