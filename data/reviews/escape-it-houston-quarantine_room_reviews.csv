"Escape room ""Quarantine"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston-quarantine,0,We did the Quarantine room and it was great! The puzzles followed a logical order and we never got to a point to where we were just lost or didn't make any sense. Very well thought out puzzles and great theming in the room. Will definitely have to try out the other rooms.

We did the Quarantine room, and made it out with about a quarter of an hour to spare. The puzzles were challenging, but not unmanageable. I'm definitely going back for Ramses Revenge, and when it it's ready, the Titanic."

We had 7 heads and it took all of us to figure out the clues, but WE WON! The atmosphere was creepy and with the sounds it all made the experience feel real. Angela our game moderator was fun and such a nice person! I'm looking forward to trying our next Escape very soon!!!"
