"Escape room ""Mona Lisa Heist"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/Conundroom-Mona-Lisa-Heist,0,Had a group of 5 people and we all had a blast! Was impressed with the number of different puzzles and even our one year old had a blast watching us have fun trying to figure it out. Definitely better way to spend time with family than a movie. Thank you for the great experience!

We were there for something different and to celebrate Vet Day.. what a different experience. Took us a few minutes to get the first clue down but we got the hang of it and made it with out a second to spare! ha Highly recommended it!! Super fun time.
"Escape room ""Mona Lisa Heist"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/Conundroom-Mona-Lisa-Heist,3,I got to do this while I was in town visiting my youngest brother and absolutely loved it!! We did it with a group of five which was just enough for us to divide and conquer the puzzles without stepping all over each other. Everything was very well put together and a ton of fun to do. I highly recommend this!!

Booked it for my husband's birthday as a surprise. Thankfully we brought friends with us, we needed the additional brain power. Had an amazing time! I highly recommend trying it. We'll be back to try their newest adventure and see if we can beat our escape time."
