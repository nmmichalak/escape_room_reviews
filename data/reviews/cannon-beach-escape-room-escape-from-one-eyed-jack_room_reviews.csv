The puzzles were fun and was definitely my favorite part of our weekend. I would recommend it if you are in Cannon beach and want something fun to do. We did the pirate one."

We had four in our family, plus another family joined us and we had an excellent time escaping. Had to ask for help a time or two, but the clues were challenging so we didn't get an easy out. Really enjoyed the puzzle and are looking forward to trying the art room next time. The Pirate room was great fun for all, but definitely for older kids if you want them to really help you solve your way out!"
