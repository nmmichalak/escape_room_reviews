"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Mentor in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escapology-mentor-budapest-express,1,Great fun had a blast in the Manor murder escape room. Also really enjoyed the challenge of the Budapest murder mystery.
"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Mentor in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escapology-mentor-budapest-express,2,"I've done a ton of escape rooms all over the country, so I was super excited to find out that Mentor now has its very own escape room company! My group and I did the Budapest Express room and we had a great time. The theming was fun and I was very impressed with how the room incorporated technology into the story/puzzles. Also, I liked that the puzzles all fit in with the storyline of the room; the things we were doing made sense given the time period/plot. My only critique is that the rooms in Escapology aren't actual rooms; the walls don't extend all the way to the ceiling so there's a lot of outside noise from people doing the other rooms and the nearby bowling alley. It wasn't too distracting once we got into the swing of things, but I can see how the noise might be an issue if you were trying to concentrate on solving a particularly difficult puzzle.If you're an escape room fan (or you've been wanting to try one out) I definitely recommend visiting Escapology. The next time I'm back in town I definitely plan on playing another one of their other rooms!"
