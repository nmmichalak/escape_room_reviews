"Escape room ""aXe Raiders"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-axe-raiders,0,We've done the Axe Raiders room here and loved it so much that we took our daughter and her friends back for her 11th bday. The clues are challenging and clever and the staff is so fun and helpful. We love their rooms and will definitely come back to try the other ones!!!

This was our follow-up and although it was very good, it was just not quite as professionally done as the first. We did the Axe Raiders room, and as another person commented, the first component was pretty lackluster ~ multiple combination locks! It got much better in the next two segments. We had to ask for a number of clues but made it out just in time."
"Escape room ""aXe Raiders"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-axe-raiders,2,Our group had such a wonderful time playing the Pharaoh room. High-quality effects and just challenging enough. We escaped and broke the record with 33 minutes on the clock and no hints. Our game master Sandi was extremely warm and welcoming. We'd definitely come back.
