"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,0,"To Zach, Josh, Courtney, and Brianna, thank you from both Dylan and me!! This staff will bend over backwards to make sure you enjoy your time in their rooms! It is absolutely clear that this group of employees is close knit and well managed. Each personality shines in it's own way, adding to the fun of each visit! These are some of the best rooms available. We've played escape games in at least five major cities and after having played 'Heist, Gold Rush, and Spec Ops' these are some of the best!! The sheer ingenuity of each room is astounding! We were challenged in ways we'd never before seen in a room. If you're seriously considering taking up the escape room challenge, do yourself and a favor and book here! It may be just a bit more expensive than other places, but it is ABSOLUTELY worth it.Again, thank you to Zach, Josh, Courtney, and Brianna for making our experience fantastic! Trust and believe we'll be back with reinforcements to take on Prison Break!"
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,1,"We played Gold Rush today and out of the over 30 rooms in six states (yeah, we are addicted!), this was tied as our favorite room.Great game play that is very immersive and fun to do. Puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration. The game masters do a great job of helping you along but still letting you get the answer yourself. Great staff, awesome props and equipment and great location! Already booked another one for tomorrow!!!"
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,2,"Best. Ever. I've tried several escape rooms in the past. I found that most of them don't make much sense to follow especially in the beginning. You have to be some sort of psychic to get started. This one is clean, logical but also with varying difficulty. It's clean, well organized with great instructions. The people working there are friendly and the scape room is fun! We did the gold rush escape room however there's many more to choose from. They vary in difficulty and next time we're gonna try the hardest one. If you get out in time you can buy a prepaid card for 15% off the next visit! After trying a couple of escape rooms in other locations I was weary of trying this one but they definitely change my mind to how much fun escape rooms can be and I will be going back for sure! I think you should definitely check this place out, it's located near the SunTrust braves stadium. There's tons of places to eat there there's also tons of other fun stuff to do there including shopping. It has a great night see you in the area and I think there's parking available but it's paid. The price per person at the escape room is fairly decent around 35 bucks. Some of the rooms start later like around 1130/11:45 PM and they open around 8am (they rooms run through out the day!) I was impressed and had a great time!"
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,3,I had some time to kill before catching my flight home from Atlanta. I was walking around the stadium and found this escape room. I've never played before and had the time to kill so I thought I'd check it out. I HAD THE BEST TIME! I played with my boyfriend and we chose the Gold Rush room. We had a blast! We are hooked and will most definitely be back. The staff are very helpful and kind. They sign you up quickly and can get you in the next room available in a snap! Hope to see them again on my next visit!
"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,4,"So fun! Loved it! We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted and felt welcomed and comfortable. Great lounge area overlooking the Battery while you wait. I wasn't sure what to expect, because each game is unique and everyone's experience is different. I'm not gonna lie, it was not easy. But CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! We had 3 teams of 8. Our room was the Gold Rush. I won't give anything away. I will tell you our room host was Richard and he was really helpful to us first timers. You have an hour to escape the room. I was worried about claustrophobia for some but it wasn't like that at all. Plenty of room. You are given a few clues which are helpful. Adrenaline rush was fantastic! Everyone had a unique contribution to help us solve our way through. Logic, math and common sense. And we did it with over a minute to spare! You get a sticker proving you did it and if you want, you can buy merchandise to further brag about your brilliance. You HAVE to try it. I will go back, for sure! Thanks to the entire staff for a great, fun afternoon!!!  You guys and girls rock!!!"
