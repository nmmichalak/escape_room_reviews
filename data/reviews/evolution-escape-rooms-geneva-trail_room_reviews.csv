"Escape room ""Geneva Trail"" by Evolution Escape Rooms in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/evolution-escape-rooms-geneva-trail,0,Awesome activity for first date.

I had the pleasure of trying to escape the cabin. It was the perfect combination of fun and challenging. Our group of seven managed to escape with 3 minutes to spare. Highly recommended!
