"Escape room ""The Crimson Storm"" by Puzzle Effect Bakersfield in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/Bakersfield-Escape-Room-The-Crimson-Storm,3,I've never even attempted something like this before but it was absolutely worth the price of admission. I want to say so much but I will not spoil anything for anyone. It's foolish to not give this place a try. Thank you for the great experience!

The waiting room was excellent (I didn't find any clues there. I think I failed at waiting.). We were all so excited when we figured out the last puzzle that we were jumping all around, and several of the staff were just as excited as we were. It made the whole experience amazing."
"Escape room ""The Crimson Storm"" by Puzzle Effect Bakersfield in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/Bakersfield-Escape-Room-The-Crimson-Storm,5,"My wife and I just got back from doing our first escape here. It was so much fun! The suite is around at the back of the lot, but its not too difficult to find. The staff is super friendly and greets you with a smile when you walk in. After you sign in they brief you on all of the rules and give you the story set up for your room. Then they walk you to your room and its time to escape. Actually ""escape"" is a bit of a misnomer, its not really about escaping, its about solving the puzzle. I didn't feel ""trapped"" and there was nothing scary, which is a good thing for a claustrophobic haunted house baby like me. I don't want to spoil anything about the puzzle but I will say that it was just difficult enough that it never felt overly frustrating and that my wife and I had an absolute blast solving it along with the other couple in our group. We finished with 20 minutes to spare! We will definitely be back again to try out more escapes. I just hope they will keep more new escapes coming so that we can come back more often!"
