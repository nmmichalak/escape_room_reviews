"Escape room ""Central Intelligence"" by Down the Rabbit Hole in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/down-the-rabbit-hole-central-intelligence,0,"We are big lovers of escape rooms, but this was easily the worst room we have ever tried. We did the CIA room, and it was so convoluted to the point that it was not even fun. We used all three of our clues and still couldn't progress without help. We are not stupid or incompetent, this room was just not designed well at all. I would not recommend this company to anyone. It was really disappointing too because we had some ""first timers"" with us, but the experience was so poor that they may never want to try another one. Very upset- total waste of money."
"Escape room ""Central Intelligence"" by Down the Rabbit Hole in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/down-the-rabbit-hole-central-intelligence,1,"We've done two of the rooms here and really enjoyed both experiences. We've done some rooms at other places as well, but we found some unique puzzles that we hadn't seen before. Our one quibble is having a gamemaster in the room with us. It's a little disconcerting (it's harder to argue over a puzzle solution with a stranger watching), but it's a minor point, and we look forward to trying more rooms (also trying to get a group together to do the Asylum...we are motivated to escape that room!)."

We've done some rooms at other places as well, but we found some unique puzzles that we hadn't seen before, particularly while working on the Christmas room. Our one quibble is having a gamemaster in the room with us. It's a little disconcerting (it's harder to argue over a puzzle solution with a stranger watching), but it's a minor point, and we look forward to trying more rooms (also trying to get a group together to do the Asylum...we are motivated to escape that room!)."
