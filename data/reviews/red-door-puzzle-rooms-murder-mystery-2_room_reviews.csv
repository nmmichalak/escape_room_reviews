"Escape room ""Murder Mystery #2 - Case File"" by Red Door Puzzle Rooms in Bowling Green",https://worldofescapes.com/bowling-green/quests/red-door-puzzle-rooms-murder-mystery-2,0,"Our three generation group had a tense, but fun time trying to solve the murder mystery. Even though we didn't beat the clock, we certainly beat the blues! The staff member who assisted us was super - very personable, friendly, helpful, and good humored. We'd love to go back and try our hand at another room!"
"Escape room ""Murder Mystery #2 - Case File"" by Red Door Puzzle Rooms in Bowling Green",https://worldofescapes.com/bowling-green/quests/red-door-puzzle-rooms-murder-mystery-2,1,Did the Murder Mystery #2 room with two friends and we all had an amazing time. The room is tricky enough to be engaging and not impossible to finish as long as you use your time wisely and think out of the box! A great way to spend an hour in Bowling Green. Especially on a rainy day. I would highly recommend trying a room to anyone! The staff is wonderful and our experience was amazing. 10/10 I hope we all get to escape again - and maybe try that higher difficulty.
