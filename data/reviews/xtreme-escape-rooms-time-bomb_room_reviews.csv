"Escape room ""Time Bomb"" by Xtreme Escape Rooms in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/xtreme-escape-rooms-time-bomb,1,Best escape room experience by far! Did both “Time Bomb” and “Patient Zero” and both were challenging and fun. The puzzles are logical and fit the story lines and all tie into each other. Patient Zero’s added bonus of the live actor added to the fun and to the challenge! Can’t wait to try the new rooms!

I thought the theme in the Time Bomb was clever, fun and unique. The flashlights, town entry and other props were a nice touch that I’ve heard other escape rooms don’t have. I would definitely take more people back here again if and when I can!"
