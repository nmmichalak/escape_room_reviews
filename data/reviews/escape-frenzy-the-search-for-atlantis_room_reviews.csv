Our family was in town for Christmas, and we wanted a fun activity to do before everyone went back home. This was great! We did the Atlantis room. I loved how the TV screen gave clues when were stuck and helped us move in the right direction. I will definitely be back sometime and try another room!"
"Escape room ""The Search for Atlantis"" by Escape Frenzy in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-frenzy-the-search-for-atlantis,3,We had a group of 5 and did Search for Atlantis. It was a great room for our first escape room ever and it was so much fun! We managed to escape and had a blast working together and figuring out the clues. I would definitely come back and do the other rooms! The staff were great and made it an awesome experience!
"Escape room ""The Search for Atlantis"" by Escape Frenzy in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-frenzy-the-search-for-atlantis,4,There were 8 of and only one person had ever done an escape room so we were all rookies! We did Escape from Atlantis and had a great time. The staff was great at giving hints only when we were really struggling or going way off track but letting us work through all the things we were closer to figuring out.There were enough different puzzles that everyone could be involved and participate which was awesome for team building. We would definitely come back to do another room!
