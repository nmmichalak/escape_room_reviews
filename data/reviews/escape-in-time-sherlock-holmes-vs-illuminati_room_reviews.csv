We were a group of ten and we did the Sherlock vs the Illuminati. I loved how we all worked together to find the clues and solve the puzzles. The tasks were challenging and very well thought out. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We all agreed that we will be back again!
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes vs Illuminati"" by Escape in Time in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-in-time-sherlock-holmes-vs-illuminati,4,Went here with my family. There were seven of us in total which was a great number for this room (Sherlock vs the Illuminati). It was a great experience. The owner is really pleasant and explained how everything worked and even walked us through the first puzzle so we could get a feel for it because it was our first escape room. The puzzles in the room were challenging but not impossible and the whole family was able to get engaged. We cracked the room in just over 50 minutes and would definitely recommend this place. They also do parties and I think it would be fun for a group of kids. Very family friendly.
