"Escape room ""Gold Rush 1849"" by Time Escape Loveland in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/time-escape-loveland-gold-rush-1849,1,"We went there for a birthday party and our group of six was given the Gold Rush room. We had a blast and despite the room being a little warm, it was a fantastic time for all of us who had never done an escape room. While it was a little tough, we had a smart little 12-year old in the room with us to help with the clues! Escaped with 1:43 left and couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had! I love that it's a local, family-run business. We will be back!"

We did Gold Rush and came up just short but still had a terrific time. The clues are well done, and the staff wonderful! Can't wait to come back for their other rooms!"
