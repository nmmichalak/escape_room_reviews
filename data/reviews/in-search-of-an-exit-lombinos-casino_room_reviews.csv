"Escape room ""Lombino's Casino"" by In Search Of An Exit in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/in-search-of-an-exit-lombinos-casino,0,This escape room was really awesome and well thought out. My work team had a lot of fun solving all the puzzles to open the wall safe and the 80s nostalgia was nice too. I love Alf! Our host was also very nice and personable.

We had a fantastic time. We all didn't think we'd complete in time but we did with about 4 minutes to spare.  It was challenging, entertaining and put together very well.  The owner was personable and patient with some of our team members who can be a bit of a handful. He answered all our questions  and truly set us up for success. "

Unlike other, lesser rooms, Lombino's Casino has a variety of puzzles that cater to all kinds of different minds - not to mention, a number of plot twists and surprises that you'll never see coming. The room has been constructed with painstaking attention to detail. You really become part of the story."

Two first-timers to escape rooms and one veteran. The puzzles were fun and challenging. We were very close to solving but ultimately ran out of time.
