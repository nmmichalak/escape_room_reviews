"Escape room ""Dr. Fratelli's Cabin"" by Escape Artist Greenville in Greenville",https://worldofescapes.com/greenville/quests/escape-artist-greenville-dr-fratellis-cabin,0,"Escape Artist Greenville is hands down my favorite escape room company! I have been to four other escape rooms in Asheville, and one in Charlotte, and this was the best of all of them. The puzzles are clever and fun, the staff was friendly and helpful (Luke is the man!!!), and the room was very well put together and slick-looking. I will absolutely be back!"
