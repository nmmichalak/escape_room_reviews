"Escape room ""The Secret Training Facility"" by Xtreme Xcapes in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/xtreme-xcapes-the-secret-training-facility,0,"My husband and I did our first room here today. we did the secret training facility room and we had a blast. The guy who hosted the room for us was very nice and cheerful which made it a lot better! Room was clean and well put together. The puzzles weren't hard, but making the connections was the difficult part! we have done many rooms before and this by far is one of my favorite places to go! We will be back in the future, even though we didnt make it out in time :)"
