"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Greensboro in Greensboro",https://worldofescapes.com/greensboro/quests/breakout-games-greensboro-do-not-disturb,1,"We took a group of five guys and did ""Do Not Disturb"" as a part of a bachelor party. I was a bit skeptical at first, but due to the rainy weather we had to find something to do inside. We were not disappointed at all; actually, I think we were all a bit shocked as we were laughing and loving it within about 3 minutes. Our 'game master' (I think was her title) Carly was great. She helped us when we asked for it and kept us from feeling too bad when we didn't get out in time. I would (and will) absolutely do it again. It's worth the money."

Very happy to have made it out. Tom was a great host and game master.  He nudged us just enough to help us through. Already planning our next visit! Recommend it to everyone!

We loved it! I think in hooked! It was just the two is us doing ""Do Not Disturb""; we didn't quite make it, but really enjoyed the challenge. Our game master was perfect at suggesting clues when we were way off base or stuck, helping without robbing our sense of accomplishment. Can't wait to try another room."

We escaped 2/3. The rooms were well thought out and a lot of fun. Weâ€™ll be back to play the other three!"
