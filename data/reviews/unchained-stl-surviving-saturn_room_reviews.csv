"Escape room ""Surviving Saturn"" by Unchained STL in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/unchained-stl-surviving-saturn,0,My son wanted to do an escape room for his 14th birthday. We booked a room at Unchained STL Escape Room. The boys had an amazing time!! Listening to them talk about their experience on the way home was the best part. The room was perfect for them and they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I highly recommend booking an experience with unchained!

Did surviving Saturn and really wanna go back to try the vault. Also, I was part of the team that set the new surviving Saturn record. You can try to come and beat it, but you better be pretty good."

If you like good clean fun this is an awesome activity. I went with a group of 6 for the Surviving Saturn room and we had a blast. The owners were really cool and you can tell they are passionate about escape rooms."
