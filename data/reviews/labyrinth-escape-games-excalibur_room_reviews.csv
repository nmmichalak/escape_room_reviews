"Escape room ""Excalibur"" by Labyrinth Escape Games in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/labyrinth-escape-games-excalibur,0,"Wow! What a fantastic experience. A group of adult friends and I experienced the Excalibur adventure. And an adventure it was! The staff was professional and friendly and even showed us some of their other escape rooms after which only made us want to come back again! The venue is perfect and we made a night of it by having a Mesa Tacos afterwards. Make sure to book your escape adventure in advance. Honestly my favorite part of the night was feeling lost for an hour transported to another world without technology, and work and the craziness of life. Laughing with friends, being a kid again for just one hour...priceless."

My sons loved it and have been asking to go again! The room clues were challenging, thought provoking, and fun! The host was friendly, courtesy, and made the experience memorable. When they call to offer clues they get in character for the room you are escaping! I would recommend Labyrinth Escape Games for an amazing, memorable, fun experience!"
