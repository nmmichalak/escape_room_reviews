"Escape room ""Museum"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-museum,0,"We did the Museum room with the family, which included my twin 10 year olds. It was very fun and very challenging. I loved how the kids really got into it - my 15 year old was leading the charge (and getting a little annoyed with her parents!). We did not succeed, but that only motivates us to go back and do another room now that we have the gist of how this works. Highly recommend!"

The museum room was so much fun, the women that worked at 60 escape was so helpful and sweet. I would recommend for families or couples. We already booked another room."
"Escape room ""Museum"" by 60 to Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/60-to-escape-museum,2,This was my first escape room experience. The staff was in character the whole time we met with them and the room we were in was bigger than I had thought it would be. The set up was done nicely and the challenge was fun. We finished with six minutes remaining on the museum heist.I will be going back to attempt the harder challenges which have even lower completion rates! The staff also keeps track of how many times you try the challenges and it is noted on your score. This was a very fun group activity!
