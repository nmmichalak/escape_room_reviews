It was very fun. The staff was great and very helpful. They didn't just let us flounder around with no direction. We had a group of 3. It really helped retrying #'s with the locks. We had a couple that one person tried, and didn't get. Then, another person tried it and it worked! It was a fun thing to do, and got us out of the house for a bit!"
