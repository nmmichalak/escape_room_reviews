"Escape room ""OPERATION: X-13"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/trapped-escape-room-operation-x-13,2,"This room will make its debut on August 2, 2019. I was lucky enough to book it during its trial phase, and even though it was only about 90% done, it totally passed my expectations! The gadgets provided to us as a communication device with our teammates totally made me feel like I was in a spy movie. Puzzles are creative and dense, which allows everyone in the group to do something and work together. I do not want to spoil anything further as you should really experience this room yourself! I definitely recommend!!Customer service here is also top notch. You can tell that the owner is really passionate about escape rooms and takes his time to listen to comments and opinions about how to improve the place. I also want to give a shout out to the lead game master for being so into character, making me also into character, and closely monitoring our game to give us the proper hints at the right time. He is also filled with jokes that made the experience much more pleasant.There is still one room here that I have not done, so Trapped will definitely see me soon!"
