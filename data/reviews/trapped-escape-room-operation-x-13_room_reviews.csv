"Escape room ""Operation: X-13"" by Trapped! Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapped-escape-room-operation-x-13,0,"This is the second location of the original Upland Trapped. Our team of four played the X-13 Room and escaped with 8 min left using only one hint. Very fun, realistically immersive game. Good puzzles and tech. The staff was fun to work with and helped us keep the story going throughout the game. Highly recommend any of their rooms, and can't wait until the new ones open!"

Tried the Operation: X-13 room with a couple of my friends and they all had a good time (it was their first escape room). Definitely would want to try the Sector 13 or the Down the Rabbit Hole at their other locations. Overall a good experience, would recommend!"
