"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-runaway-train,0,"Went here for a family event and played the Runaway train. Lady named Val greeted us in the lobby and was very friendly. Our game master was the manager named Stephanie, she was awesome. We broke out with ten minutes to spare and only used two clues. Had a ton of fun. Highly recommend."
