"Escape room ""Dracula’s Castle"" by Escape Room Extreme in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-extreme-draculas-castle,3,This was my first time doing an escape room. The group of friends I was with who have done many escape rooms all agreed it was the best. We did Dracula's Castle which from what I understand is a more hands-on room and very interactive. We made it out with about a minute to spare. Definitely want to go back again!
"Escape room ""Dracula’s Castle"" by Escape Room Extreme in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-extreme-draculas-castle,4,First time doing an escape room and it was awesome! I would definitely recommend the Dracula's Castle. We beat it with 1 minute and 50 seconds. It was difficult but our game master Joe was helpful and helped us when we needed it. It still made us think a lot! Great friendly staff.
