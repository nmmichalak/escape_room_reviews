"Escape room ""The Cellar II: Saul's Revenge"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-cellar,0,"As a first timer and coming within seconds of making it out of The Cellar, I was so excited and proud! Very challenging experience, but fun, stimulating, team building and an all around great time. The staff was amazing, friendly, and helpful, the waiting area was full of awesome stuff to play around with if you arrive early, very clean, neat and organized. I can't wait to see what more you build!"
"Escape room ""The Cellar II: Saul's Revenge"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-cellar,1,"4 of us locked in ""The Cellar"" with Saul the Butcher popping in and out periodically. What could be a better Friday night in October than that? We really had to put our thinking caps on and get creative (in between laughing our butts off). We got right down to the wire but managed to escape with one minute and 22 seconds left! Very welcoming place...we can't wait to go back and try the Vault!"
"Escape room ""The Cellar II: Saul's Revenge"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-cellar,2,"We had such a fantastic time! We did the Cellar tonight and it was like a dungeon. Really did a great job to make the story work and it was really creepy. We have done other escape rooms with different companies where the ""story"" was just window dressing and didn't really matter. Here it was a fully realized story with an atmosphere to match. The puzzles and clues all fit into the setting and it felt like you were doing a lot more than just hunting for a lockbox key. Tons of fun and worth every penny!"
"Escape room ""The Cellar II: Saul's Revenge"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-cellar,3,"We played ""The Cellar"" and it was by far the best escape game we've ever played. We had so much fun! We had a group of 6 ranging in age from 14-37 and everyone loved it. The room was perfect for our group size and the puzzles were challenging but able to be figured out. Even though we didn't escape, we came very close and had a blast trying!"
"Escape room ""The Cellar II: Saul's Revenge"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-cellar,4,"We have been to Lock and Clue twice, and both times had an absolute blast! We were afraid that our second time around wouldn't be as challenging since we had done a room before (the vault) but Saul's cellar did not disappoint! Lock and Clue has great staff that go above and beyond to make your experience a memorable one. I highly recommend this location...you will not be disappointed!"
