"Escape room ""Hacker: Corruption Disruption"" by Grand Rapids Escape Room in Grand Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-rapids/quests/grand-rapids-escape-room-hacker,1,"Poor design, poor upkeep, no feedback, to many red herrings.Room's floor was sticky (similar to a cheap poorly kept movie theater), LED lighting was broken in multiple parts of the room.Key hide location was JUNK! No indication it was there, they expect you to slide your arm into dark areas to find it (with the poor upkeep I did not do it until they gave me hint about it because there were already some sharp metal areas where screws were not fully attached.Also puzzles had ZERO feedback. One area you flip dozens of switches, push buttons, and attach cables. However there is ZERO feedback unless you get ALL parts correct... then a door opens... however it is 30 feet away in another room so you do not even know it opened unless you happen to walk over there.TERRIBLE design of the backdoor inside server cabinent.Please.. Please... provide blacklight in first room... paint ""door, here.... slide to left to open"" in UV paint thus people would know the thing exists... we spent 10 minutes climbing around poking at the totally unrelated power cables inside the cabinet until the came master finally told us a door was in there."
