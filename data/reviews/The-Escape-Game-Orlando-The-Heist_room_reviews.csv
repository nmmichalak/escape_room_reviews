"Escape room ""The Heist"" by The Escape Game Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Escape-Game-Orlando-The-Heist,4,I loved this game so much. I came in by myself and your staff were super accommodating in putting me in a group. And super nice in moving me to another group when my original group didn't show up. Michelle in the lobby was super nice and helpful. Kaylyn (I think) was our guide and did a great job too. The group I was with was awesome and we solved THE HEIST with 9 minutes to spare. The game was super inventive and well thought out. I was so excited to do this and am so glad I did. Well worth the money
