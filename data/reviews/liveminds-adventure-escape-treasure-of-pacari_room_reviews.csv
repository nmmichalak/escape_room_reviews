"Escape room ""Treasure of Pacari"" by Liveminds Adventure Escape in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/liveminds-adventure-escape-treasure-of-pacari,0,"We were in town visiting and looking for something fun to do. Liveminds was our answer, and what an amazing adventure it was!This was the second escape room type place I've been to. Liveminds goes above and beyond anything similar. It was comparable to being on a movie set. The experience was all immersive and each and every little detail was carefully thought out. From the decor to the sound effects- I was blown away! We chose to do Treasure of Pacari. We had a small group (4)  of varying ages and everyone had a blast. This specific room felt challenging but also doable (that just right level of difficulty). Each second we spent inside made us feel like we were indeed exploring ancient ruins in search for the item! If you are looking for a fun birthday plan or something new to do on a Friday night in the Nashville or Franklin area, I highly recommend Liveminds! I can't wait to go back and try one of the other rooms. Thank you for an awesome experience!"

It is really in the top 5 of game experiences we have had. The owners are apparently professional set designers and the attention to detail and authenticity to the world we entered really showed (we did Pacari) - additionally the staff were super friendly and helpful."
"Escape room ""Treasure of Pacari"" by Liveminds Adventure Escape in Nashville",https://worldofescapes.com/nashville/quests/liveminds-adventure-escape-treasure-of-pacari,2,I did the Treasure of Pacari and this was by far the best breakout room I have ever done! Went with my family and another family and we all got to get our hands on something. The people were very kind and the rooms are just insane. Can't wait to try the other rooms:)
