"Escape room ""Sasquatch"" by Escape The Netherworld in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-netherworld-sasquatch,1,"This was the first escape room experience me and my friends have ever tried and we were very happy that Netherworld was our first escape room. Our room was the Sasquatch and it was awesome. The set design, the puzzles, and the scares were very well done. We felt as if we were actually in a horror movie with a Sasquatch trying to break into the cabin. If you are looking for a fun time for you and your friends then this is a must. I can not wait to go back."
