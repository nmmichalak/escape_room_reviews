"Escape room ""The Clock Tower"" by Escape the Room Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/escape-the-room-boston-the-clock-tower,0,Great time doing Clock Tower for a Thursday evening. My group of friends and some strangers were able to play this game and communicate well to escape the room under an hour. The Clue Master was very helpful at the start of the game and throughout the game.

I've done a handful of escape rooms, and this was one of the best. The production values were generally excellent. I do think the optimal number of people would be 6-8 active players, there were times where 1-2 people didn't have much to do. The solutions were presented in a very cool and satisfyingly mechanical way, and the atmosphere was really well designed.Our guide had fantastic energy and was helpful exactly when needed. Overall, it was a great, well-run escape room that I would wholeheartedly recommend!"

The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of they decide when to give you the clue - so if you are struggling there's really nothing you an do about it. Another escape room I've done in the past, you yell ""clue"" and they put something up on the board for you - you can only ask for 3 though - or they start taking time away.We made it out with 4 minutes to spare - but it was super anti-climatic. We felt that some clues weren't used and we were super confused when the door opened. But we got out and I guess that's really all that matters!We will definitely be going back to try the other rooms!"
