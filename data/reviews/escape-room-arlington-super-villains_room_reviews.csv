"Escape room ""Super Villains"" by Escape Room Arlington in Arlington (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/arlington-va/quests/escape-room-arlington-super-villains,0,"I've been to several escape rooms, and this one was fantastic. We did the super villain room with our family which ranged in age from the 20s--60s and all were challenged and had a great time... and we escaped! Unliked other escape rooms I've done, this was great for my family with lower mobility.The decorations and theme were fun, the puzzles were fantastic, and there were elements I had never encountered before and loved. All that plus the staff was friendly and welcoming.We'll be back!"

The lobby was beautiful, the staff super friendly and the escape room (Super Villains) challenging and very well done! After playing many other escape rooms in the area, I would definitely pick ERA as one of my top favorites!"

The puzzles were hard enough to keep it interesting and, if I am honest, my kids were better at it than I was! They loved it and are ready to go back and do other rooms. The place is so nice and clean and the rooms are big with lots of details. Staff were super helpful and engaging. I would highly recommend as a fun thing to do for a family with older kids."
