"Escape room ""Toxicity"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-toxicity,1,Played Toxicity tonight and absolutely loved it. I've played almost all of the rooms in the area and this is for sure one of my favorites. Without giving anything away I'll say that the room is immersive with very well thought out puzzles. Can't wait to come back!
