We did ""Mystery Mansion"" with four people and were about 90 seconds shy of finishing in time. Meghan was our host and she did a great job making sure we had fun. Highly recommend and we'll definitely return!"

I did the mystery mansion here and I plan to return for the others! The people were nice and they even started the game when we showed up too early.

They let me in even though I was about 10 minutes late, which I thought was particularly nice. The puzzles are challenging, but I never felt uncomfortable being locked in the room. They have several different rooms. I did the mystery mansion room. I didn't know the people I was with, but they were awesome, and I came out with new friends! I'm so glad I tried this. I would definitely recommend this to my other friends and family. Thank you, Breakout!"

We had a blast doing Mystery Mansion. Our Game Master Oliver was very friendly and over all AMAZING! Having done multiple escape rooms, we really enjoy BreakOut games. When we needed a little help he gave us just enough of a hint to point us in the right detection with out giving to much away. We definitely be back."
