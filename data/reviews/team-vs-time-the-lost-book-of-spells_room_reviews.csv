The escape room is done so well that it immerses you in the game and you really have to work as a team and use all your senses to locate the clues. I highly recommend The lost Book of Spells for a fun night out!

"Escape room ""The Lost Book of Spells"" by Team Vs Time in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/team-vs-time-the-lost-book-of-spells,3,Amazing experience! We played in a group of five and it was our first escape room experience. I must admit that we were a bit skeptical at the get go but as soon as we crossed through the door and into the witches lair our mood and experience was transformed into one of wonder and excitement. The ambiance and the environment were superb. You really felt like you were lost in a witch’s house in the woods. Each room felt very different and full of exciting surprises. We had so much fun working through the puzzles together. It’s a must do for everyone who likes this kind of experience. Two thumbs up.
