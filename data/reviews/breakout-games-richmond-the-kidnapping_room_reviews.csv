"Escape room ""The Kidnapping"" by Breakout Games - Richmond in Richmond (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/richmond-v-a/quests/breakout-games-richmond-the-kidnapping,4,"AVOID—dishonest managementThis is a chain, so the rooms are very cookie cutter, inexpensively designed and somewhat predictable. The worst problem is their dishonest management. I had only paid through Groupon before, but when looking at their online booking engine, noticed they were charging 10% taxes. There is no applicable tax in Chesterfield County, so I contacted them to let them know and they reduced it to 7%. I contacted again and let them know that no amount of tax was appropriate and they claim to be charging ""admissions tax."" The City of Richmond has an admissions tax, but Chesterfield does not. Further contact has gone ignored. Upon checking a few of their other locations, I see that they charge around 10% ""taxes"" for each of them. This is tax fraud. They are clearly not remitting this income to the municipalities in which they operate. They're just jacking your price up after the fact. You'll have a much better (and honest) experience at River City, Ravenchase or Room Escape USA—all ethically managed with much more immersive and creative design. Avoid this one."
