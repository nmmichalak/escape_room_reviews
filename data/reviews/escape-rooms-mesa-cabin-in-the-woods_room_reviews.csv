"Escape room ""Jack's Cabin"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-cabin-in-the-woods,4,"This place was tons of fun. Our family decided to go at the last minute and were able to make reservations for a room all by ourselves in ""Uncle Jack's Cabin."" This was our first escape the room experience and it has to be one of our favorite family night activities. We were happy to have made it out with 14 min to spare. We were impressed with how well they thought out each clue and left looking forward to going back again. Our daughter would love to do this for her birthday party. We would highly recommend this place. They have many rooms to choose from with different levels and themes. We will be back."
