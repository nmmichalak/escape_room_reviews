"Escape room ""The DEEP"" by Escape Rooms Unlocked in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-rooms-unlocked-the-deep,2,"We did the ""Deep"" room this week while we were down for spring break with my parents (in their 60s) and our 2 nine-year-old boys.  My parents had never done an escape room before - mom was skeptical and dad had no interest (""Can I just pay you for my ticket and wait outside?""). We all really had such a ball!!  The room was creative and clever and when we left, my mom just kept saying over and over, ""That was so much FUN!"" then ""That was just SO much fun!""  And now my dad, two days later, still excitedly reminds us, ""How about how I solved the first clue in that escape room!""  We have been to several escape rooms in different cities and this was by far our favorite. My kids declared it their most fun part of all of spring break, and asked for Escape Room birthday parties next year. Will definitely be back next year for spring break!Additional notes:- I was a bit worried about having to do any crawling (we've been in some rooms at other places in the past where we've had to crawl through tight spaces to get from room to room), but they assured us that all their rooms are grandparent friendly!  - I particularly love how they give you a clipboard with paper to work things out - first time we've had that!  - We all commented that there was something for everyone in the room to keep everyone engaged in solving the puzzle.  It was really so thoughtfully designed."
