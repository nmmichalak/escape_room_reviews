"Escape room ""Cabin in the Woods Escape"" by LI Escape Game in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-game-li-cabin-in-the-woods,0,If you are new to escape rooms than this room will certainly feel passable. If you've played a few mid to high quality escape rooms you'll definatly be disappointed. The puzzles are ones that are relatively regurgitated in the industry and the theme is really lacking. The set quality is  mediocre and if you're expecting to be creeped out or scared try escape rooms closer to Manhattan.

The puzzles are uneventful but challenging.  If you're new to escape rooms and up for a challenge its worth the visit."

It was challenging and very fun. You are allotted three hints if you need them. The game is very well designed. Our host Amanda was great! Very friendly, helpful and willing to answer questions before and after the game. We will be returning to try other rooms."
