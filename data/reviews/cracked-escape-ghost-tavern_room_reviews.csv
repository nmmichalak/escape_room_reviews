"Escape room ""Ghost Tavern"" by Cracked Escape in Akron",https://worldofescapes.com/akron/quests/cracked-escape-ghost-tavern,0,"We had a fantastic time with a group of 6 escaping the Ghost Tavern room! This was our first time in an escape room. We didn't know what to expect, and were just hoping for a fun time. It was beyond what we could have imagined as far as fun! The puzzle was tricky, but with enough silliness to keep it from being too frustrating. The ""set"" was perfect, wonderful details that kept us in an old west frame of mind the whole time."

Completed the Ghost Tavern room w/ 6 people. Decor was great, puzzles were really challenging, and the immersion was really cool. Staff was super friendly and helpful for a group of first timers. Definitely will be coming back to do the other rooms in the future! Thanks!"
