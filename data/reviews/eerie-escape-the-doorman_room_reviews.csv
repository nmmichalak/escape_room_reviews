"Escape room ""The Doorman"" by Eerie Escape in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/eerie-escape-the-doorman,0,We had a blast escaping The Doorman room! I love that we have an escape room on the east side! The woman who was working was great and seemed genuinely excited when we got out of the room with 2 minutes to spare! I highly recommend Eerie Escape! We will definitely be back to try the other rooms!
