"Escape room ""World War II - 10th Mountain Division"" by Mystery Quests in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/mystery-quests-WWII-10th-mountain-division,0,"We did our team building event with Mystery-Quests. We were in the WWII room. Not only did we have a great time, but we learned a little something about ourselves as a team. Thank you!! I can't wait to see what the other rooms are like!"
"Escape room ""World War II - 10th Mountain Division"" by Mystery Quests in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/mystery-quests-WWII-10th-mountain-division,1,"We did this as a sibling and sibling-in-law night out and LOVED it! We had no idea what to expect going into it, but we loved it so much we all left saying we wanted to stay and do another room or come back the next day. We did the WWII room and would recommend it to anyone. Even though we didn't ""escape"" and solve the clues in time we still had a blast. This is totally worth the money for a fun night out with friends, family, or co-workers. They even let us walk through the rest of the clues after time ran out so we could still see what we would have gotten to if we didn't run out of time. We really liked that aspect."

It was still a lot of fun and challenging. We plan to do it again when we come back to Colorado Springs to visit.

This was our first room escape. There were 3 people in our group and the WW ll room was a real challenge. Needless to say, we were captured. We had an awesome experience and can't wait for our next adventure.I wasn't sure I would be any help to the team as I didn't possess the logical reasoning like my team did.Debi assured me ""No matter what your skill set, everyone is an asset in your team.
