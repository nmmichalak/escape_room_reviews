"Escape room ""Confinement"" by Red Door Escape Room in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/The-Escape-Room-Confinement,1,"Honestly, it is difficult to review this game as it has many controversial features that detract from the otherwise good experience one may have, such as an quite twisted form of utilizing a highly political issue as a jumping off point for a religious message (trigger warning: if one is upset at the thought of abortion and damnation for such choices, this game is not for you). Otherwise, the set is good enough and develops throughout the game, and the puzzles, while common, are fun enough and will likely satisfy newer players. "
