Although we failed our mission in Area 51 and were taken over by the aliens, we still had fun! Owners and staff were friendly and accommodating."

The staff was fantastic from moment one. Helpful in every way. Thank goodness the aliens didn't take us back to the mothership. Can't wait for the catacombs. Great place to do work team building too.

All of us had an amazing time working together to solve Area 51. We escaped with only 24 seconds left! The staff was helpful, informative and the video was a great icebreaker! We will be back again!"
