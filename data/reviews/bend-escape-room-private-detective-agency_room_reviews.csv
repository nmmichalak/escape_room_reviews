"Escape room ""Pipe Works"" by Puzzle Effect Bend in Bend",https://worldofescapes.com/bend/quests/bend-escape-room-private-detective-agency,0,"Everyone was so friendly and helpful every time I've gone and done a room. It's been an amazing new experience each time. The rooms all look amazing and authentic. Having just done the new room, Knight and Rook, I can say I have a new favorite, it's so fresh and new and really neat to be in with even cooler puzzles. I recommend this to anyone and everyone."
