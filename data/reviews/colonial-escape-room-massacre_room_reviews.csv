It was hard, but we all had fun trying to solve it. The owners definitely are creative and make it challenging. It wouldn't be fun if it were easy. I will definitely go back."

It took us slightly more than an hour to solve, but they let us finish. The puzzles were of reasonable difficulty for our 4-person crew. We would love to do the other two rooms sometime soon."
