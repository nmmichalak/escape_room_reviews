"Escape room ""Vegas"" by Amazing Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/rush-escape-room-las-vegas,0,We took my cousin here for her 40th birthday and we all had a blast. We were a group of 9 and managed to escape this fun room. Definitely try the Vegas room!
"Escape room ""Vegas"" by Amazing Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/rush-escape-room-las-vegas,1,"My family and I had a blast at the Amazing Escape Vegas-themed room. It was our first escape room and I wanted it to be a successful experience, so I chose the Vegas room since folks have the best success rate at it (according to the website). The hints we received while in the room helped make it the success I hoped for. It came down to the wire - 1 second left - and when the door opened we all erupted into a celebration yell and high fives all around. Wonderful experience. Two of our group were initially concerned about feeling trapped in the room, but they didn't have any problem."
