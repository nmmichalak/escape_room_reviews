Did all 3 with my team and escaped all of them! The Krampus room was by far my favorite, some great theming and excellent spooks. The Tiki Palace and Spaceship were challenging but lots of fun. Staff was welcoming and very accommodating. Cheers to Countdown Live!"

To be honest, they're a very gifted bunch and my 3 kids had done multiple other rooms in the past. They actually escaped with 38 seconds to spare (took 3 hints). They all had such a great time and the host Brian is a really great guy. Can't wait to work up my courage to come back with my husband and some friends to try out the Krampus room. We'll be back!"
