"Escape room ""Haunted"" by Escape This Live in Frederick",https://worldofescapes.com/frederick/quests/escape-this-live-frederick-mad-lab,0,"Good aesthetics and staff. Room was tough, but not super difficult. Countdown clock in room. The puzzles weren't the standard combination lock type. Some puzzles were tough and the solutions weren't always straight-forward. The room wasn't particularly creepy or scary - but it has its moments. We had fun and will be back for more rooms."
