We escaped with plenty of time to spare but still had a lot of fun. The building is very inviting and modern. Impressed with it. We would like to do the other rooms they have."

It was such a well-put-together event! We had a great time and definitely had to put our heads together to figure out all the clues. Highly recommended!

It was very challenging, super fun and so exciting! He loved it and everyone who came kept saying how great it was. Can't wait for our next escape."
