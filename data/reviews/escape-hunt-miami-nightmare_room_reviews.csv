All could participate, thanks to a couple of hints from the Game Master, we succeeded and the kids are looking forward to coming back.2nd time with 6 colleagues. Super fun, finished in 53’, still with some hints, but in advance to enjoy drinks and tapas that were organized. Cheers, excellent team building."
