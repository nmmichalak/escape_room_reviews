"Escape room ""Revolution Spies"" by Escape Room Mystery in King of Prussia",https://worldofescapes.com/king-of-prussia/quests/escape-room-mystery-revolution-spies,0,The Revolution Spies room was really fun and challenging. It can't be done alone so bring a good team with you. It's theme fit perfect with the local history of Valley Forge and the Continental Army. It includes tradecraft from the era and mixes it with a little modern technology. I like the free group picture offered at the end that we can look back on.

I would definitely recommend this place!"
