"Escape room ""The Other Side"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/room-escape-los-angeles-the-other-side,2,"We escaped from ""The Other Side"" at Fox in a Box. The room was well done with a nice variety of tasks and puzzles supported by good room design and tech. There was a challenging use of transitional spaces that demanded some brainpower. It wasn't just an easy stroll to the other side.This Fox in the Box location has game masters that are invested in you having a good time. They are positive, enthusiastic, and genuinely seem happy to be working there.Definitely do this new room and if you haven't had the pleasure of doing the other rooms here, they have a twofer Tuesday special for their older rooms."
