Booked the Gold Rush for a Friday night and it was so much fun! Made it out with 8 minutes to spare. The puzzles were great, but what really made the experience phenomenal was the staff. Lee and his brother were friendly and their dedication to the rooms were top notch! Can't wait to do another one!"
