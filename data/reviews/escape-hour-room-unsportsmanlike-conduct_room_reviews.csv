"Escape room ""Unsportsmanlike Conduct"" by Escape Hour Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escape-hour-room-unsportsmanlike-conduct,1,We did this with a group of friends. One group did the Wild West room and we did the sports locker room. The room was very challenging and forced us to definitely work together to get through it. You have to keep and open mind and think out of the box. Everything is something. Will definitely be back to try the other room. Highly recommended.
