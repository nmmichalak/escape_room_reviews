(For the record, we did make it out with 5 minutes to spare, but it was challenging!) Super fun. Our host was awesome, the room was the right balance of fun and challenging, and the building itself has a really neat history. I also appreciated that the room theme wasn't super dark or creepy--it was lighthearted and there was great 80's music playing throughout! We're excited to check out the Prison escape room next."

I did the Yager's bar escape room with some friends and we were able to get out in 53 minutes. I highly recommend this place! I will be coming back to try the prison escape room!
