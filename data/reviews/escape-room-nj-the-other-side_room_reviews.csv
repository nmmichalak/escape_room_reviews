This is the first Escape Room that I have ever down with a large group. All of the rooms that I have done in the past were with 2-6 people. In this room we had 15 and I wasn't sure how it would work. Well we Escaped and I am sure we wouldn't have escaped with out the team, we worked so well together and there was so much to do that I can't image having a smaller group. Escape Rooms Rule!"
