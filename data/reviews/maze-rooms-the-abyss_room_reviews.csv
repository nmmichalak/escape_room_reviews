"Escape room ""The Abyss"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-the-abyss,0,"Abyss is so much fun! It's very tech related and the puzzles aren't like the other puzzles in other rooms. You have to really think what you would have to do in that situation. Also, the simulations are really cool. You feel that you are truly going under water, because the capsule moves slightly to give you that feel. If you are very claustrophobic I'd advise against this room, as the space is kind of small. Not extremely small, spacious enough for 2 people to move around, but not a lot. Very fun maze room. Highly recommend."

The maze was perfect for us being new to escape rooms. It got our brains spinning quite a bit but looking back at it, it wasn't as difficult as it should have been for us. It was good for beginners. Definitely a fun time and left us wanting to come back to try the other rooms out"
"Escape room ""The Abyss"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-the-abyss,2,"I attempted this room with my boyfriend recently when we found out that this opened because we had been wanting to do a room with just us 2 to see how much better we have gotten at escape rooms. This room was immersive, but that's every maze room escape room. It was pretty linear, considering how the room was only designed for 2 people to play. The only issue I had with this room was that there were a few technical issues with the room, such as things opening when they shouldn't, and other parts not working properly. I imagine they probably fixed it now, but those were some issues we had when we were playing this room. We still managed to escape with a few minutes to spare, although I imagine we would have escaped much quicker if we didn't have all those technical difficulties that threw us off. "
