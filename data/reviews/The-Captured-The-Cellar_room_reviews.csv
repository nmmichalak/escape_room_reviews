"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-The-Cellar,0,"This was fantastic! Scary atmosphere, pretty difficult clues but we made it! Definitely recommend and we all wanna go back to do the room we didn't complete!"
"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-The-Cellar,1,This was the first escape room we had ever done and we’ve done many since then. None of them come close to this one. We did Scarlett’s room and it was amazing from the second we walked in! I don’t know if we’ll find another that will beat this one!
"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-The-Cellar,2,Last night was my first date with someone. I chose The Captured thinking oh this will be a cheesy thing like so many things in Gatlinburg abs Pigeon Forge are. Absolutely the best choice I've made in a while. We both loved it! The staff are excellent we made it out alive. I can't speak enough about the staff and this experience. I think I'm addicted to escape challenges now
"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by The Captured in Pigeon Forge",https://worldofescapes.com/pigeon-forge/quests/The-Captured-The-Cellar,3,We had an awesome time!! It was well worth the money for the experience. If you're in Gatlinburg check this place out! I can't wait until our next vacation here so we can try some of the new rooms that they're adding! Do it!!

We had an absolute blast. Really well done. I highly recommend it, it was the best thing we did on our vacation!"
