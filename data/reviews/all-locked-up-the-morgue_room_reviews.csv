"Escape room ""The Morgue"" by All Locked Up in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/all-locked-up-the-morgue,0,"We have done all 4 rooms! And all the rooms are awesome. From the suspenseful room of The Morgue to the very realistic rooms of The Garage, Aunt Debbie's Apartment, and The Classroom. They are all great, and whether you win or lose you are guaranteed a great time. The staff is very friendly and thank you to Big Mike for always being so welcoming! Definitely recommend this place for a date night or fun family night."
