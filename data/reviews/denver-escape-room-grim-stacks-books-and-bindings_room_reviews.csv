"Escape room ""Grim Stacks: Books & Bindings"" by Puzzle Effect Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/denver-escape-room-grim-stacks-books-and-bindings,0,Staff are super friendly and helpful. The overall theme/feel of the room was wonderful that fit the back story provided well. The puzzles were well designed and all very interesting while still providing a certain level of difficulty. There weren't any red herring puzzles/clues so that's always a plus in my book. This is the second room i've done with them and will be back for The Path.

We will definitely be returning, though hopefully we'll have better luck in the next room. We did Grim Stacks and ended up getting and lot of clues from the employees (but they were awesome sports about it), and didn't finish it in the 1-hour time frame, but it was still a lot of fun!"
