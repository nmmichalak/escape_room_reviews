We had someone in our group that was a little scared and your employee eased her fears! Sam was awesome and patient with our 10 year olds!!! Definitely family friendly and a good time for everyone!!!! My daughter said she had the best birthday at her first escape room experience! She is hooked! Thank you!!!!
