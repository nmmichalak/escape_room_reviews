You will enjoy any room!  Gold rush is fun because so many puzzles can go on at the same time.  Everyone in our group of eight was constantly working on solving puzzles.

This escape room is awesome! Everything is well put together, and the staff is wonderful!! We chose the Gold Rush, and it was challenging but fun! We had to use some extra hints ;-), and we enjoyed a bunch of laughs at our own expense. Highly recommend The Escape Game Dallas!!!"

We surely found our adventure as we took on Gold Rush and Prison Break! There was so much that we loved but we can’t pick a favorite because both rooms were just amazing! Zach was an awesome Game Guide and was very helpful. Two thumbs way way up! I’d give a 10/10 if I could! We will be back for more!"
