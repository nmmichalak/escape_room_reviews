"Escape room ""Zodiac Killer"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Irvine",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-zodiac-killer,0,"I love Fox In A Box LA. I have done two escape rooms there now. The first was the zombie lab which while fun, was only okay. The second was this one, and I thought it was amazing! We escaped with 5 minutes left. Some of the clues were really difficult and without a hint, we wouldnâ€™t have solved. Somehow, we figured most of it out ourselves. We had so much fun and will definitely come back. This escape room is very nice despite the surroundings looking a bit sketchy (aka the strip club across the street) I would definitely highly recommend this escape room to anyone who enjoys a good time. It was also a bit scary at times. "
"Escape room ""Zodiac Killer"" by Fox in a Box Orange County in Irvine",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/fox-in-a-box-orange-county-zodiac-killer,1,This was our first escape room. It's very challenging. We tried The Zodiac Killer! It was great. The employees are so great and made it an incredible experience. We can't wait to go back. We are going to try every game. My husband and two kids have never tried an escape room before and they were very impressed.

The workers are super friendly. We had a group of 3 and were at the moment of getting the code to get out of the room when our time was up. I would highly recommend it to any age group. We did the Zodiac room and it was so much fun. Lots of puzzles to solve and clues to find. We will definitely be going back!

It was very puzzle-heavy instead of easter egg hunt-esque. Super friendly and helpful staff, especially Matt. I would absolutely recommend for people who have done a puzzle room or two before. The Zodiac Killer room rocks!"
