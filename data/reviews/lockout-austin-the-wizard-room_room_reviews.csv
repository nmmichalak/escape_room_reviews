"Escape room "" The Enchanted Chamber"" by Lockout Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/lockout-austin-the-wizard-room,0,This place was super awesome. We picked the seasonal Wizard room as we had kids in our group. We enjoyed it a lot! The puzzles were very engaging and the kids were able to contribute too. There was also a live actor in the room which made it a lot more interesting! Overall a very enjoyable experience.

We had a great time! There was an in-character live actor wizard in our room who served as the escape room host - he was great. Most puzzles were designed for 12+ to do on their own. Our 8-year-old kids assisted here and there, but all had a great time! A really fun experience."

I did the seasonal Wizard escape room. We were a group of 4 adults, a 15-year-old and 3 eight-year-olds.This room was wonderfully thought out and was more challenging than I expected. It was perplexing even for the adults but it was still solvable. We had an hour to solve it and we got out with 7 minutes to spare. The kids had lots of fun too but it would have been completely impossible for them to solve the puzzles alone. Great for friends and family as long as there are a few people over the age of twelve!"
