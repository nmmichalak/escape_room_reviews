"Escape room ""We're All Mad Here"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-were-all-mad-here,0,"We had a lot of fun. We did the pirate themed one last night and the ""We're All Mad"" today. Both were up there in difficulty, which is great for those who do escape rooms regularly and need a challenge. We're definitely going to come back to do the last room."
"Escape room ""We're All Mad Here"" by Escaped In Time in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/escaped-in-time-were-all-mad-here,1,This was our first escape room and we specifically chose to do this room due to our love and enjoyment of Alice in Wonderland. Loved all the great details of the room. We definitely felt like we'd been transported to Wonderland.

I love challenges that require cognitive function and problem-solving. The whole family seemed to have a great time even though we didn't quite make it out in time but we came extremely close! We chose the ""Everyone's Mad Here"" challenge room and it was nothing short of entertaining. Thank you Escaped in Time for the experience and we will definitely be back before heading home from our vaction!"

This was my husband and my sixth escape room. This room didn't disappoint. Every escape room we go to offers new puzzles we've never seen before. If you've done an escape room or if you haven't, you will totally enjoy this room. The details are amazing, and hand painted by one of the owners. Give her props when you go because I don't even know how she did it. We did the Mad room, middle of the road on difficulty and there were certainly times where we were just dumbfounded, until we got that clue. "

The rooms are well thought out and challenging, yet very fun and exciting! We are self proclaimed ""escape room junkies"" and would highly recommend Escaped In Time! ï¿½"
