"Escape room ""The Parlor"" by Escape 20/20 in Grand Rapids",https://worldofescapes.com/grand-rapids/quests/escape-20-20-grand-rapids-the-parlor,0,"Worst 25$ I’ve spend. I have tried an escape room another place before and this was no where near in quality, originality or fun. Not only did we have to share a room with a group of strangers, we didn’t get a background story as we were supposed to stated on the website, and we simply got bored! This is not how an escape room should be! Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone. "
