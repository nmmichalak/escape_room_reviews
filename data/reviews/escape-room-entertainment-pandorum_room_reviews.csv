"Escape room ""The Knights of Norwich"" by The Escape Company in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-room-entertainment-pandorum,0,"Amazing! I have a done a couple of different escape rooms and this place is definitely one of my faves! The Pandorum was pretty hard, and we didn't expect it to be scary but it was a blast! The outlaw room was super fun and unexpected! One of the best parts is that you can have wine or beer while you're in the rooms and if you need any more, just ask for some and they will deliver it to your room. I mean what??! They also have some fun board games in the lobby you can play before or after. Also, this spot is right next to Player One, a video game bar! Me and my friends really did have the time of our lives and it's all thanks to the manager Alix, our awesome host! She gave great clues without giving too much away which is what we wanted. Thanks for everything Alix, we had so much fun!"

We made Pandorum, 100% recommended. Very good thematic, tests and very original games. And a game master that thanks to knowing our language helped us to have a great time. Thanks for everything!"
"Escape room ""The Knights of Norwich"" by The Escape Company in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-room-entertainment-pandorum,2,Was fantastic. Did suburban serial killer first and was one of the best escape rooms I've ever done. Then we did the Pandorum game. It was too hard! Don't go into the game expecting to win. But it was SUPER fun! Just attempting it was a lot of fun. Love the crew there as well. Can't recommend this place enough.
