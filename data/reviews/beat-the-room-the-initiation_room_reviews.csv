"Escape room ""The Initiation"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-the-initiation,1,So much fun! Did the Initiation. I'd say 5 people is a perfect amount for that room. The other rooms apparently are bigger so maybe more for them. Loved the service and the ambiance. Difficulty was perfect for us 5. Will definitely return for the other rooms. Completed the secret society in 53 minutes. Not bad for the first time!

At first look it seems like an easy task, until you begin to look at the details. After 52 minutes and 20 seconds, we found the final clue and Beat the Room. What a great time! I highly recommend it if you are looking for something fun to do. Good Luck in there."

The ambience of the location was really neat the put a lot of detail into the business. We did the Secret Society Room and it was well done. There were lots of interesting clues and tricks to each room. They also make sure it's fun for any skill level by helping you if you need it. We wouldn't have finished in time without there help, so even though we didn't get on the leader board we got to complete the room. Great for skilled intellectuals and fun for newbies. I definitely can't wait to try another room."
