"Escape room ""CheckMate"" by Michigan Escape Games in Davison",https://worldofescapes.com/davison/quests/Michiga-Escape-Games-CheckMate,5,We came here for something fun to do on a Saturday night. Our group of six had a great time and would highly recommend this place to anyone!
"Escape room ""CheckMate"" by Michigan Escape Games in Davison",https://worldofescapes.com/davison/quests/Michiga-Escape-Games-CheckMate,6,"I have been in four rooms. The concept is very interesting, however, I feel as though one or two of the workers ""sabotage"" you from escaping. Before we began each room, we were told that we could get 2 hints without losing time on the clock. Twice now, we have been told that we used our 2 ""free"" hints already when in fact both times we only asked for one hint in each room. I can't say what other things happened as it would give clues to the games. The price for each game is not cheap and for us to be ""cheated"" out of our ""free"" clues and other mishaps is totally unprofessional.It also depends on the person working at the front desk whether you complete your mission. I have personally had three different workers and one especially feels as though he is sabotaging your efforts.I will try one more room and if it happens again, then I'm done. I will let everyone know how it turns out."
