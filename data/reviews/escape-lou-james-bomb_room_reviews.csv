"Escape room ""James Bomb"" by Escape LOU in Louisville",https://worldofescapes.com/louisville/quests/escape-lou-james-bomb,0,"We chose the James Bomb room for our first family escape room and we had so much fun! Our party consisted of 9 people, five of them being kids between the ages of 10-17. And they too loved it! Even though we failed the mission, it was such a wonderful experience that we canâ€™t wait to do it again in the Mr. Dupree room. Thanks Escape LOU for a fun filled day!"

It was just the two of us, but we had a great time! I am sure it is even more fun with a larger group. We didn't complete our mission, but we were SO close and needed just a few more minutes. Our host was very friendly and made it a great experience. I definitely want to go back and try the other missions. Thanks!"

My co-workers and I did a team building event there (played James Bomb) and I think it's safe to say that we were all very impressed. Everything seemed like it belonged in the room and the puzzles/clues felt integrated into the room, theme, and experience.Wonderful experience. Look forward to playing there again."
