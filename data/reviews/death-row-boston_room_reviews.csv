"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,0,"You think getting out of jail is easy? Think twice. Being locked up in this real cell was an incredible experience....while I was trying to solve the enigmas we were presented with, I laid on the cold steel bed and thought of the many people that must have spent the nite there wondering about life behind bars. It gave me the chills but also motivation to work hard and trying to escape. We had a great time and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. It doesn't get more real than this.Gamekeeper did a good job at easing us into the game and put us in the right mindset. Their setup is very good and professional and fun is guaranteed."
"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,1,"The cells were used in the good old days (used to be a holding facility) which gives it a wicked realistic vibe. The only con I would have to say is that there are A LOT of challenges that are related to the same type of challenge. This can be overwhelming when you're expecting a new type of challenge, however, they did what they could squeeze in that room so overall it was great! If you're claustrophobic then this DEFINITELY isn't for you (remember jail cells are not spacious) haha"
"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,2,"We played this room as a small group back in November and had a blast! It is an authentic jail cell (well, two -- they separate you out into two groups, one group per cell). You have to work together to escape, which is a fun twist. The clues are hard, but not impossible. We did, in the end, escape, but we were right down to the wire. This was really fun and authentic without being scary or creepy. It is perfect for a group of 6 people, and probably best if you all know each other (as you are working together through a wall). I would highly recommend this as a great, different night out!"
"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,3,"My colleagues and I were looking for something different to do after work. One of us had done a similar type of activity once, so we decided to check it out. You might think that spending an hour ""solving puzzles"" may not be that engaging, but the theme and atmosphere of this breakout make this into a total experience. Without giving anything away, the setting and feel of the surroundings make this into a totally immersive experience. I would recommend this to any age or group of people."

The setup, execution and back story were awesome. The room we perfectly fitting to what they were going for. Highly recommend this ""escape the room"" to all of my friends. I have heard that they did a bit of tweaking and I might be able to go back soon. Great Job guys"
"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,5,"If you are looking for something fun, exciting and mind challenging to do on the weekend with your friends. This is a place to go. It's pretty awesome because you're actually trying to break out of a real jail cell. We just did it with another couple yesterday and it was my first time doing it. I gotta say that was intense, stimulating, and lots of fun! Great for a girls night out, guys night out, birthday celebrations or corporate team building events. Highly recommended! #amazeescape #jailcells #jailbreak #teamwork #fun"
"Escape room ""Escape from Death Row"" by Amaze Escape in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/death-row-boston,6,So much fun! They made good use of the holding cells in the old Arlington police station. The sound effects and the cells added to the fun. The puzzles were challenging and fun to solve. Loved it!
