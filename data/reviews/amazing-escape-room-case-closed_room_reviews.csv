We did the mystery/detective room. Facility was relatively clean and well-kept. Escape room was challenging but still enjoyable. Definitely recommend for a fun time!"

It was soooo much fun. We didn't get out of the room on our own, though. Thank goodness the staff was so wonderful. They let us out to go home. I can't wait to go back. I can see where this could be addictive. Who doesn't enjoy a good puzzle to solve."
"Escape room ""Case Closed"" by Amazing Escape Room in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/amazing-escape-room-case-closed,2,"We did the Case Closed room, which was tricky but not impossible. We were the only group to successfully complete it all day (out of 7). I was more confused and not sure what to do next in this room than in a different Escape room I had done, but some were much more obvious. For example, we would solve a riddle and get a code, but not sure where to put that code. The other room I had done was more ""fun"" because there were more puzzles, locks, and clues, and less trying to figure out what to do with answers. The other room was in the suburbs.All of the mechanics and clues worked without issue. The employee who watches and assists was funny and attentive.I would not recommend this room for kids younger than high school. Some of the puzzles are math based, or things they just won't get yet. It was great for adults though."
