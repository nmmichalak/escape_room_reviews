"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/escapology-round-rock-extinction,0,"Did ""Extinction"" first, was sooooo close to solving it but ultimately failed. Despite the failure, we enjoyed the game so much we booked ""Nuclear Annihilation"" for later the same day! Solved that one in 44 minutes! I could have done all four games in one day, it's just that fun."
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/escapology-round-rock-extinction,1,We had a group of 14 celebrating a birthday. Patricia was wonderful about emailing and talking by phone to work out the details and get us set up in the rooms we wanted to experience. The staff was awesome from the moment we got there until the very end of our experience!  We all had a blast in the Extinction and Annhillation rooms! Can't wait to go back!
"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/escapology-round-rock-extinction,2,"I've been wanting to try an escape room for a long time, so I was excited when a friend booked a room for her birthday. There were five of us and we did the Extinction/Antidote room. I was afraid that the puzzles would be frustrating (especially when we first walked into the room and there were lots of chemistry symbols) but they were the perfect amount of challenging and fun. The staff was extremely pleasant and professional - you could tell they enjoy what they do.I would definitely do Escapology again and recommend it to others. I hope to get to try the other rooms soon!"
