"Escape room ""This One Time, in the 90s..."" by Red Herring Escape Rooms in Shreveport",https://worldofescapes.com/shreveport/quests/red-herring-escape-rooms-this-one-time-in-the-90s,0,"We did the 90's themed room. My first time doing an escape room. Was scared beforehand that the clues and puzzles would be lame, but I was wrong. The puzzles were challenging, creative and fit the theme of the room. Me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed it and are planning on trying every room they have! The staff was friendly and helpful. And prices were very reasonable. Fun for all ages and personalities!"
