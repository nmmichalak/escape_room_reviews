"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,0,"After doing 50+ rooms, this is one of my all-time favorite rooms. Unique puzzles that fit the themes nicely. The cleanest design I have ever seen and was esthetically beautiful. A mix of modern and traditional elements. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the booking process. I am usually not a fan of walkie-talkies for hints. However, the walkie-talkies used were simple, worked well, and hints were given quickly demonstrating that the game master was tracking our progress carefully. Lock Down delivers a solid A+ escape room experience which can be a rare find these days."

"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,2,Did Theft and Samurai yesterday. It was defiantly on our top list of escape rooms. The rooms are fairly spacious so large groups can fit very comfortably. Staff was fun to talk too. Definitely coming back to try out Chem Lab.

The rooms here are fun, challenging, too notch. Great place for date night, team building or even the whole family( we brought our 14, 13 & 9 years old kids). I can't say enough about how nice the staff there is, friendly, helpful and very professional! We will be back for a third time soon!"
"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,4,"There are a wealth of great room escape options in the East Valley and Lockdown rates among or at the top of the list.  Our team completed the Theft and Samurai rooms and were thoroughly impressed by each of them.  The puzzles are clever, engaging, and challenging.  Better yet, they truly feel as if they are organic and belong in their environments.  What sets Lockdown apart from other escape rooms is their commitment and attention to a particular aesthetic.  They have realized that challenge does not have to detract from the overall immersion of a room escape experience.  Their design principles are a welcome change from the many rooms where escaping the zombie apocalypse, a fallout shelter, or an alien research facility requires the unlocking of a half dozen bike locks.Lockdown is a challenging, affordable, and engaging option for a group room escape.  Their staff is friendly, enthusiastic, and welcoming.  We will surely be back to enjoy their other experiences."
