"Escape room ""Escape Area 51"" by Race to Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/race-to-escape-escape-area-51,2,"Our first experience here was a family venture and it was amazeballs!! We did the Area 51 room and I must say, some of the puzzles were difficult and for the majority of the time the family was crazy lost in their own puzzles they were finding. There were a good amount of puzzles that caused us to work together as a team (which is why we were there in the first place!). There were certain riddles that were mind boggling!! The guys in the tech room were great with their added clues for help!!! In the end, we ultimately saved the human race from destruction and got out of the room. Will we be going back?? You bet!! Heck, I wanna have my company go there too!!! Thanks so much for a great time!!"
