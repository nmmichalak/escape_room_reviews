"Escape room ""Grim Stacks: Books & Bindings"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-escape-room-grim-stacks,0,"We did the Grim Stacks escape room as a team-building exercise, and it was definitely a team effort! Ultimately, we escaped with just a second left! It was difficult, fun, and exhilarating at the same time. I've done about half-a-dozen other escape rooms, and this one was definitely amongst the best.Thanks to Heather, Tucker, and the rest of the staff there. It was a great time, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun escape room."

My friends took me to an escape room to start off my bachelorette party! We did the Grim Stacks room. It was challenging and fun. Had some exciting moments during it! Very well put together. We didn't make it out in time, but we were so close!"

The group I was in participated in the Grim Stacks challenge. It was so much fun! The challenge was just right and we missed the final clue to solve the puzzle by just a couple minutes but it was still so much fun! Looking forward to visiting again!
