"Escape room ""The Art Gallery"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-the-art-gallery,0,We did the Art Gallery and almost escaped. The hour goes by so quickly! Every puzzle leads you to the next lock. So if you are stuck on one puzzle you can't skip ahead or work on something else.Other escape rooms I have been to have had bigger rooms and different puzzles that had no particular order which made it feel less frustrating - you can work on other puzzles when one activity had you stumped. Definitely a fun date night idea!

The puzzles were challenging and engaging. The staff was friendly. The room was small but it took us the full hour to solve all the puzzles required to exit. Definitely recommend trying it out if you are looking for a fun date idea or something to do with friends.
