"Escape room ""Psycho Dentist"" by The House of Clues in Santa Barbara",https://worldofescapes.com/santa-barbara/quests/the-house-of-clues-psycho-dentist,0,Psycho dentist was a great room!  The decor and storyline were just awesome. I have done 50+ escape rooms and highly recommend this place.  The technology was pretty cool but the twists and turns in the storyline were by far the best attribute of the room. Some of the puzzles didn't exactly fit the theme but nevertheless it was a good room. The management was super friendly and I can't wait to go back and do the Ghost Ship.

Our group did the ""Psycho Dentist"" room. We had a large group (9 people) which typically isn't the ideal size for this, but we had a ton of fun and easily made it work.We all left agreeing that we will definitely be recommending this to other teams from our company."

Our host Asel was super accommodating and friendly with our last-minute booking. She even honored extra time since we were a 2 people team. We were very grateful for that.We did the Psycho Dentist room. We enjoyed every minute although most of the time, we were scratching our heads trying to put together puzzles and clues. We needed countless hints indeed, every time when Asel sees us struggling, she knew we needed help before we even spoke. We can easily say this was one of our favorite escape room out of all that we've done. Definitely come check them out."
