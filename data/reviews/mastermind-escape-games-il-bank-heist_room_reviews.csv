"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/mastermind-escape-games-il-bank-heist,0,We've done two rooms at Mastermind and we really enjoyed ourselves both times! We did Lost in Time and came back and did Bank Heist. Bank Heist was definitely trickier but both were super fun! Love a fun night out that's more than just sitting around at a restaurant.

It was an exciting challenge for our group of six experienced players. The first part of room was linear and then split into multiple paths later. Clue delivery system was via an iPad and you chose easy vs vague clues. Perfect for us but the scoring system didn't make any sense to us and staff seemed a bit impersonal. Room itself was a blast and puzzles were well done. If you are an enthusiast, choose this room."
