This was the most fun we've had in a while. You are locked in a room with clues that you have to figure out in an hour in order to escape the room and get the picture to prove you got out in time. The clues are some common sense, some general math and problem-solving. We visited 2 other game rooms with other companies and this one is by far the best. I am so glad they opened up in Montgomery. They are also located in a great side of town!!"

We were a group of 8 ranging from ages 7 to 66 (grandchildren, children, and parents) and everyone had a great time. We did the museum heist room and we barely got out in time. This place is clean, the staff is friendly, and one hour goes by really fast. Everyone is our group was able to participate and were genuinely excited and happy when we left."
