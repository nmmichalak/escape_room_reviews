"Escape room ""Project Dark Cyber"" by Armadillo Escape Room Adventures in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/armadillo-escape-room-adventures-project-dark-cyber,0,Awesome experience but I can tell you the Cyber is challenging so bring some better help than me! Going back for some Time Travel! Loads of fun for all!

The puzzles were clever and interesting (and fun) and there was so much to do and see in the room. I loved the multiple tracks and wish I lived close so I could try the room again! I've done many escape rooms and this one really stood out for the complexity and quality of the room, the friendliness of the staff, and the all around great time!"

I would totally recommend the Project Dark Cyber room; hard but so much fun! Time travel one was just as fun and a little easier (we escaped!)"
