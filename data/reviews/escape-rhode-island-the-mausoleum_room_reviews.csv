"Escape room ""The Mausoleum"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-mausoleum,0,"We had an amazing time here! We did the Mausoleum and even though we didn't solve everything in time, it was the best experience!! Will definitely be going back. The puzzles are harder than you'd think, especially with a time limit."
"Escape room ""The Mausoleum"" by Escape Rhode Island in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/escape-rhode-island-the-mausoleum,1,"I came to Escape RI a few Fridays ago as a team building work event. It was my first escape room experience ever and I couldn't have been more pleased! The two guys running everything were very cool and informative. They have cool games in their waiting area to keep you occupied. Don't let the location deter you, as the rooms are really fun and well put together! We completed the mausoleum themed room in 57 minutes as newbies. They provide a lot to help you succeed but also let you have fun and figure things out. They have you in groups of 6 people maximum, and that's great because then everyone has a chance to do something. Although this is pricier than say a movie or mini golf, I thought it was a complete blast! They also offer student discounts which was great for us. I hope to return and do the other themed rooms they have!"

Good fun with challenging mind puzzles, code breaking, and many activities that involve hands on figuring them out.  The entire family had fun.  The host was great - plenty of clues and clear instructions.  It was definitely worth the price!"
