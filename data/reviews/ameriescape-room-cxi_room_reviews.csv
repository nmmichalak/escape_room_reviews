"Escape room ""CXI"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-cxi,0,"Great find!!  It looked small at first, but the escape rooms were quite intricate and complex.  I was afraid of disappointment was pleasantly surprised!   Would come back for more with a bigger group."
"Escape room ""CXI"" by AmeriEscape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/ameriescape-room-cxi,1,"We have a group of 4-5 that travels around Nevada and California trying out the new escape rooms in the area. We have done 35+ now and wanted to try out all the rooms at Ameriescape. We have done all of the rooms at Xterious and enjoyed them, so we thought we would try out their new location. I called up the owner Peter who was an extremely nice guy and easy to work with. We wanted to book all 4 rooms in 2 days and we were not disappointed. The themes were all really done well and the aesthetics were on point. Axe raiders - Is their Egyptian themed room. Due to the theme it does get a little dusty and may spark up peoples allergies. This room is supposed to be their easiest and most linear thinking. All the clues seemed reasonable we might've just been over thinking it, it took us the longest of the 3 rooms but we still finished it in time. Next to Dr Guts it was the most decorated. X-mission - This one is more for thinkers. You have to be able to do basic math and have a little bit of problem solving skills vs just working with puzzles. We think this one is the hardest of the 4 rooms but still do able. We finished in #1 on the board look for ""Not team Ivan "" 1 or 2 clues seems a little over the top but still okay. You must know how to use a computer to play this one. CXI - This one took a little bit of thinking as well. There were critical thinking problems vs just look for this and place this there. It was unfortunate for us that the room was missing 2 critical factors when we did it. If it weren't for that we  could have finished a lot sooner. You also should be able to navigate though a computer.Dr Guts - This is their scary/ horror themed room. Our team believe that this one looked like it had the most work put into it. The clues were all easy to follow. Nothing seemed to out of reach. The detail and the technology used was pretty fancy. This room isn't for kids as it does have some ""blood and gore"" Well worth it with an amazing staff!"

We thoroughly enjoyed our quest and marveled at the uniqueness and cleverness this place provided. We consider ourselves quite good, but humbled ourselves to clues so it is challenging. We canâ€™t wait for the next time. Great time!"
