"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Birmingham in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/breakout-games-birmingham-do-not-disturb,0,This is the 3rd time I have played with Breakout Games - Birmingham. All experiences have been great. Can't wait for a 4th attempt.

I had a great first experience here with co-workers as a team building activity one afternoon. The staff is super friendly and accommodating, and also very helpful.Our group of 12 split in two groups, one doing the Mystery Mansion and the other called Do Not Disturb, which I was a part of.  We had so much fun with this in a ""hotel room"" theme trying to track down a kidnapper who had us trapped in the room. Trying to find clues and get out of there in one hour is a challenge but we had a blast. We didn't quite breakout, but were very close! The staff even helped along the way. They gave us 3 free clues we could ask for at any time if we were stumped. After we finished, we even went next door to get pictures taken, which is always fun.All in all, a super cool venue in Birmingham. I highly recommend coming here and hope to be back soon bringing some friends! A big thanks to Jeremy for arranging and helping make it a fun day."

James was an excellent game master for both rooms. Unfortunately we do not live in Birmingham, but I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Escape Rooms. We will definitely be coming back when we stay in Birmingham again and will bring more people with us! Thank you so much for the wonderful experience!"

We were the only two people in the room so it was difficult. Luckily our game master Emily was nice enough to help us out a few times. We had a blast. Will definitely be back but will bring more people with us lol. Also the lobby staff was so nice and friendly. Love this place.
