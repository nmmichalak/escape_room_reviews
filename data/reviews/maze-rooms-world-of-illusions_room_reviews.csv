"Escape room ""World of Illusions"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-world-of-illusions,0,"The world of illusions escape room was awesome! We jumped into a world of carnivals and magicians. This very interactive escape room had more to solve than just locks and combos. Natasha was a great guide and it was awesome to solve this tricky ""hard level"" room!Featured on Ellen and VH1, this place lived up to the hype!"
"Escape room ""World of Illusions"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-world-of-illusions,1,"Did World of Illusions room. Definitely a tough room, but nothing short of amazing! I'd recommend to anyone!I just wasn't sure what the storyline was. When we got there, the initial employee that introduced us to the waivers and instructional video was great - but then we got passed off to another guy who brought us to the wrong room at first and I don't know if we were explained the whole story when we got to the correct one. Then when we asked for the first clue, they gave us a clue for a wrong room. Luckily I recalled their mix up earlier and clarified if they were giving a clue for World Of Illusions, and they acknowledged that they gave us the wrong walkie (which wasn't even synced to the 1st room they put us in; it was for the 3rd room).When we solved the room - there was no fanfare. And as we left, there's no enthusiasm. We totally forgot to take a photo too for escaping - I wish there was more excitement when we escape and then a reminder to take a photo. Maybe there would be if we didn't use hints.I just can't wait to go back and play the other rooms because the tricks and locks and clues are high tech and wonderful. They missed the mark on creating a seamless experience start to finish though."

Great room, nice visuals and effects. I would highly recommend this room for those who have a group on the bigger side (6+). "
