My friends and I tried this out as our first escape room and we had a blast.Service was great! Even though I had booked for 6 people, one person didn't show up but it wasn't a problem. Angelique was a funny, friendly, and overall fantastic game master. She helped make the experience as good as it was.The actual escape room itself (we tried ""The Mystery of Senator Payne"") was so so so much fun. We worked as a team and really got into the game. Finished with only 8 minutes to spare!We'll definitely be back to try out ""Casino Heist""!"

She did a great job at engaging with us during our experience and was very helpful whenever we needed a clue or hint.My group tried the Senator Payne room and it was such a great experience. Very fun and a decent challenge as well! Highly recommend that room! My group did 7 people, but I highly suggest trying to keep the group at 5 people or less. Anything more it gets kinda messy and there's too many people trying to figure out the clues, which causes delay.Can't wait to go back and try another room! Great thing to do with a group of friends."

One of the best ones I've ever done. I did the Senator Payne one and the set was really perfect and detailed. All the puzzles were very different, some were more complicated and some were deceptively simple, but it kept the pace and suspense building and building and building."
