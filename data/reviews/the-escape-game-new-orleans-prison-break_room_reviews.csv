"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-prison-break,0,"Being a New Orleans native, I have completed many escape rooms in the area. The Escape Game has the best rooms hands down. The ambience is amazing and feel like you are really submerged in the worlds they create for you. The rooms have just the right amount of difficulty. It was worth every penny!"
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-prison-break,1,Don’t be scared of the price. The room is worth it. Go ahead and book it. You will love it. Staff is helpful and professional.
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game New Orleans in New Orleans",https://worldofescapes.com/new-orleans/quests/the-escape-game-new-orleans-prison-break,2,I have done a lot of escape rooms but this is by far the best. The room was very authentic. It looked just like a cell. Our room attendent was amazing. I forgot his name (cute lightskin guy)but he was very professional and detailed. Everyone in our party had an amazing time and we all agreed we cant wait till our annual trip to New Orleans so we can visit this place again.

It was challenging, but fun. Make sure you have your thinking caps on. Had my two 8 year old daughter’s with us that were able to participate and find clues to help."

It is BRAAND NEW, we actually went before it had officially opened, but I can tell it will do GREAT because everything went off without a hitch! We did the Jail Break room, apparently the hardest of the 4 rooms, and we ESCAPED! ‍‍ no spoilers here, you'll have to go try it out to get the experience! We went with 7 peeps and had a great group! The challenges and puzzles were hard and fun! So well done!!!! The staff was incredibly nice and friendly and our game master was FANTASTIC!!!! She helped us out a few times when we needed clues and had only great things to say about our group when we got out! Ok, truth be told, we needed an extra 5 minutes  but then we got out with 2.5 of our extra 5 to spare!! I highly HIGHLY recommend checking out this new game room experience! It is such a fun thing to do in NOLA (and a bonus that it doesn't require eating and drinking), it's a fun fun time!!"
