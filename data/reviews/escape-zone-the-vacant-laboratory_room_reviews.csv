"Escape room ""The Vacant Laboratory"" by Escape Zone in Jeffersonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jeffersonville/quests/escape-zone-the-vacant-laboratory,1,We had an amazing experience!!! We did the lab room and it was set up awesome! My husband and I have done at least 10 different rooms and this one was seriously amazing. We will be back to do the other rooms. This business is personally owned and she loves what she does and it shows! No details left out and so much time and effort put into it that it makes your experience great. Customer service is amazing as well.
