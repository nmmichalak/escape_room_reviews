"Escape room ""Despair"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-despair,1,"We went to Escape Reality on our Vegas escape room tour in Nov 2019 and played their newest room ""Despair""THE STORYOur car broke down on the road.  A local nurse Emily came to the rescue and offered to let us use her phone at her house.  After we got to the house, we realized that we were locked in and the horror stories started to unveil... We have to get out of the house before we become her next victims!  HIT THE BULLSEYE-Like the ""scenery"" switch ups throughout the story.-Crafty way of incorporating the past victim's clues and how we can utilize it to complete a puzzle set.-We enjoyed a puzzle with great use of sound and visuals. This helped to create the ""killer"" scene for the goal of the room.  MISSED THE MARK-Add some sound element throughout the room would help with the suspense feel.-We are not really fans of Escape Reality's clue system.  In a way, they may think it's quicker to use the iPad but, in some situations, it doesn't resolve the issue. Also, every time you use it, they penalize you on the time.  We had already solved a puzzle and a cabinet was supposed to open.  It did not make a sound or pop open, so we had no idea we already solved that puzzle.  We wasted a clue and time just to confirm that we did it correctly but still nothing happened in the room.  Eventually, we had to call the game master to come to the room just to tell us that the cabinet was open.  There are no communication devices inside the room to talk with the game masters.   Hopefully they can change this clue system in the future as the anticipation for the game master to come into the room for something like this would probably frustrate a player since it's not really a ""clue"". - UPDATE: Escape Reality Las Vegas has changed their clue system since we were there. Now microphones are installed in all the rooms and all clues are sent directly to the Ipad and players no longer have to scan QR codes. Game masters no longer have to come into the room to give clues.-In the latter part of the game, the set design felt a little bland in compare to the former ones.  Maybe some decor on the walls would help.-The ending could use a bit more ""wow"" element.TAKE A SHOT?If you like a mixture of Crime Scene Investigation and horror, you'll enjoy this room.  The puzzles are not really difficult so you can easily attempt this as your beginner escape room adventure.  Our recommended size for this room is 2-3 people.  Let us know if you escaped the evil nurse!  Escape Reality has 7 rooms at this location, and we got to peek in ""Down the Rabbit Hole"".  The set design looked amazing and we can't wait to go back to explore a different realm."
"Escape room ""Despair"" by Escape Reality in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escape-reality-despair,2,"My group had a great time at Escape Reality! We came as 9 people, split into 5 and 4, and did two rooms at the same time to see who would finish first. It was Despair vs Machina - the Machina team won by 10 minutes. As a whole group of 2 first-timers and 7 others that have been to many different escape rooms around Vegas, we found this place had great quality rooms, unique puzzles, and friendly staff! To activate clues, we were to do the YMCA dance to the camera which was a fun way to calm down when a puzzle became frustrating to solve. One Despair puzzle in particular had my group of 4 stuck for quite some time. Regardless, these escape rooms were unforgettable experiences, and we can't wait to come back!"
