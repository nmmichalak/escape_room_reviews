John Anthony is the GM and he was the one who hosted our game. He was absolutely hilarious and very chill. They can take up to 7 people here but I think it would get pretty crowded. I would stick with 5 people max to really enjoy it. This is definitely a place you shouldn't miss out on. They update the rooms from time to time with new puzzles, so I wouldn't mind going again."
