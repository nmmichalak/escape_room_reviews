"Escape room ""Wild West Heist"" by Escape at the Shore in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-at-the-shore-wild-west-heist,0,"My wife and I have done 45 different rooms around the state and the new Wild West room is one of the best rooms I've done. The flow was great, and there is some very interesting tech I haven't seen in any other room. Highly recommended."

We are a four family group and we have done several escape rooms, ages 61,56,26 and 22. We would all rate this as one of the best ones!"
"Escape room ""Wild West Heist"" by Escape at the Shore in Atlantic City",https://worldofescapes.com/atlantic-city/quests/escape-at-the-shore-wild-west-heist,2,"My family of five (three kids ages 13, 11, and 8) has now done 10 escape rooms and on a recent trip to the Shore we started researching some options. The rooms at the Trop are 18 and over so that doesn’t work for us. The ones on the OC Boardwalk are only 30 minutes so that didn’t interest us either. We found Escape At The Shore and decided to give it a try.We brought along another family and it was their first escape room experience. We did the Wild West Heist and it was perfect. Both the escape room veterans and first-timers found it equally entertaining and engaging. I also always appreciate when a room works on multiple levels for adults and kids and this one did. The puzzles were well designed and the room theming was impressive. We definitely picked the right escape room at the Shore and can’t wait to head back and try some of the other rooms."
