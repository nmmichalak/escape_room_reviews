We did the Jailbreak room with our 18 and 20-year-old kids and friends. So challenging and fun trying to figure out the clues. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Great time, we got out with 2 minutes to go. Great setup, staff will help with hints if you are stuck, a fun time. Would definitely go back to try another one."

It was awesome and challenging and made you really work for the escape. Our group was suslccessful in getting out with only 5 minutes to spare. It was a lot of fun the staff was great! Only thing I realized was 10 seemed to be a little to much for,the jailbreak but that didn't hurt of,any it was a blast we are going back to try other rooms"
