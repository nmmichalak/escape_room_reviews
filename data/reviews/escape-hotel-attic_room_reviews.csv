"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,1,"I had never done an escape room before this one, and I must say it was an excellent first experience. Two other friends and I tackled the Attic room and made it out alive just in the nick of time. One of my friends has done multiple escape rooms before so it was definitely a benefit to have someone on the team with their head in the game. The room was super creepy and dark (very on theme) and the clues were challenging but rewarding to solve. The room was extremely well decorated and believable, I felt like a part of the story and that our mission was real, but it was quite small. I think our group of three was the perfect size. We'd bump into each other sometimes with the limited space, but there were enough puzzles that all of us were working on something different at the same time. The staff were also super friendly and helpful, commending us for finishing such a challenging room. I highly recommend this place and I'm looking forward to going back to finish them all!"

We were a group of 4 and did not escape. I would recommend this for a group of friends looking to do somthing a little different. Will definitely be back!"
