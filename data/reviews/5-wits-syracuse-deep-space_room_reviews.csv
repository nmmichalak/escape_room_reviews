"Escape room ""Deep Space"" by 5 Wits in Syracuse",https://worldofescapes.com/syracuse/quests/5-wits-syracuse-deep-space,0,"Absolutely amazing, my wife and I went today and did all four rooms. The Deep Space one was my favorite, but I love sci-fi so it was right up my alley. All four were unique and the stories were engrossing too. The staff was helpful and courteous, which frankly was surprising considering their ages, kudos to them! I will recommend this for my friends with their families, can't wait to go back!"
