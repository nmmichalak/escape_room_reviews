"Escape room ""Runaway Train"" by Breakout Games - Greenville in Greenville",https://worldofescapes.com/greenville/quests/breakout-games-greenville-runaway-train,0,"It was a super fun room, some of the clues needed a lot of attention to details. Brianna our game master was amazing helping with the clues and explaining everything overall.we read online about the rooms, but if you book online and you don't have the entire group you might be put w other people, thats why we showed up directly to see if there was any room available at the time that it could be just the 2 of us, and there it was the runaway train, and although we didn't escape we had great fun!"

Runaway train was so much fun! We needed our clues in order to get the feel of how to play, but it was so much fun and our adrenaline was high in the last few minutes! Would recommend you to others!"

This is the second Breakout room we've done with these friends, and we wanted to do another one as soon as we beat the room. Cat, our gamemaster, was incredible! She was very attentive to the game, and only chimed in when we specifically asked for her help by name. When she game advice, it was clear and succinct, but did not directly give away the answer. Our group of four likes to joke a bit, and Cat played right into our group dynamic so well. We would HIGHLY suggest the Runaway Train room. Even if you don't do that room, ask for Cat!"

Shout out to our game master Taylor - you were great! Weâ€™ve done lots of escape rooms, and this one was up there with the best of them."

It was just two of us, so our game master Kalee was super helpful and made sure to lead us in the right direction without giving away the clue! We definitely would recommend this place to anyone!"
