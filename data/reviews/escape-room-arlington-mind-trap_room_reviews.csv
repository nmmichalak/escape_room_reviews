We've been to other escape rooms that weren't worth the review. We did Mind Trap.... turns out it's the only scary room they have and I. was. terrified. Definitely check them out!

We did the Mind Trap room, rates 6/10 difficulty, and we escaped with about 18 minutes left. There is a total of four rooms available to try, all ranging from different difficulties. As for the Mind Trap room itself, the decor was incredibly detailed, and the puzzles were challenging, but not impossible. When you successfully escape a room, you even get a free pin! Definitely will come back to try out the other rooms!"
