"Escape room ""Frankenstein: The Awakening"" by 60 Minute Escape Game in Murfreesboro",https://worldofescapes.com/murfreesboro/quests/60-minute-escape-game-frankenstein-the-awakening,0,"My team (4 people) had a blast in this room.  The quality was very good price and the game master, Victor got us ready to go.  The room had a nice mix of standard locks (combos and keys) and pressure and magnet puzzles.  This room was so much fun, it's not only one of the best in Murfreesboro, but in Nashville too.  If your a fan of quality rooms with really great production value then I highly recommend this room to you. "
