"Escape room ""Toys and Tragedy"" by Clues and Gumshoes in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clues-and-gumshoes-toys-and-tragedy,0,"So close, we almost made it within the hour!My friends and I did the ""Toys and Tragedy"" room. We loved our host, William! It seems like he's super passionate about telling stories. I love creepy story rooms like this because it gives a good thrill. Since all of us have different ways of thinking, we were able to help each other by being creative and finding different solutions. It was a great experience overall and definitely evoked our emotions, creativity, and curiosity!"
"Escape room ""Toys and Tragedy"" by Clues and Gumshoes in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clues-and-gumshoes-toys-and-tragedy,1,"This place was really fun. Me and my friends came and did the Toys and Tragedy room. This room was tricky enough to get the mind working and we were be able to still have fun doing all the tasks. This place does not aim to profit off of the customers and will actually let you finish the room even after the time limit because they want you to experience the fun of completing the room. Brian, the owner, is such a nice guy and easy to talk to. Would definitely   go again!!"
"Escape room ""Toys and Tragedy"" by Clues and Gumshoes in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/clues-and-gumshoes-toys-and-tragedy,2,"I came here with a group of friends to give this place a try and we had a blast!  There were 4 rooms with different themes but we chose the ""Toys and Tragedy"" one. You are given 1 hour to solve all the puzzles and unlock of the keys to escape the room.  The room was sufficiently challenging but solvable especially if you utilize the 3 hints wisely!Brian is a really nice person who showed us around.  He seem to enjoy what he does and he really supports his local community!I highly recommend this place for those who are in the Berkeley area who want to hang out or do a fun activity with their friends/family!"
