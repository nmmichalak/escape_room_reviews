"Escape room ""Do Not Disturb"" by Breakout Games - Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/breakout-games-columbus-do-not-disturb,0,"We booked 2 escape rooms as a team building activity for our company - we had 3 people in ""Do Not Disturb"" and 4 people in ""Mystery Mansion."" Both rooms were GREAT! Many of us had never done an escape room before, and it definitely seems like there is a learning curve in learning about how to look for clues, how to decipher them, etc. Both teams were too stubborn to ask for clues from the ""moderator"" until about 20-30 minutes in, but the clues that they gave when asked were extremely helpful. I would definitely do this again, either as team building or a fun night out with friends!"
