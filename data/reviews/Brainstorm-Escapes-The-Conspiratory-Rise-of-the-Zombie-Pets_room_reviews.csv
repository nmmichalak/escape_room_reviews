I was in the Zombie Room which was pretty awesome. We escaped with about 2 minutes left on the clock. Staff is great and I can't wait to come back next year for another adventure.

Excellent. Learned a lot about each other's skill sets and strengths. The host was very engaged during and after our room. He spent a long time identifying what roles people fell into.
