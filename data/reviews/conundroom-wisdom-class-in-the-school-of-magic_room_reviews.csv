"Escape room ""Wisdom Class in the School of Magic"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/conundroom-wisdom-class-in-the-school-of-magic,0,"My husband and I did this for a date night. It was, pardon the pun, magical! We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the puzzle was challenging but solvable. Great job! We are looking forward to trying other rooms by this company!"
"Escape room ""Wisdom Class in the School of Magic"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/conundroom-wisdom-class-in-the-school-of-magic,1,"My husband and I decided to try out the Wizard themed escape room for a date night out. We had a blast working together to solve the puzzles and piece together clues to win the game. They pack a lot of fun, interactive elements in a small room. There's a sorting hat on the ceiling in case you get stuck, you can ask for some help. This room is especially made for 2-4 people, and I would recommend children above the age of 9. I can't wait to bring my daughter here!"
"Escape room ""Wisdom Class in the School of Magic"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/conundroom-wisdom-class-in-the-school-of-magic,2,"So much fun! The theming and props are super on-point and there's a lot to do/figure out in the small room. It's perfect for a date night or for smaller groups. Just one tip - if you do need hints, you need to verbally ask the sorting hat for help. We, for some reason, thought you need to pull on it and we didn't get any of the hints we were hoping for. It was our first escape room and it left us wanting to check out others - just all around great job and really impressive puzzles. And one last pro-tip: if you don't finish, don't ask for the answers of the unsolved puzzles. Go back for a second go and finish it properly. Kicking ourselves a bit for not going that route."
