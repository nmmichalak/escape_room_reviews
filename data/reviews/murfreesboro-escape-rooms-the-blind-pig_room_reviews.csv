Bowling... snore. Mini golf... not in the 'Boro.Murfreesboro Escape Rooms... THAT'S the new, fun and challenging experience this city needs. My boy and I have had the awesome experience of doing 2 of their escape rooms -- The Blind Pig and Dinner for Two. The Blind Pig was my first escape room experience ever... so it was our learning curve. We came close, but failed to escape. Still had a blast. We just tried Dinner for Two this week and we ESCAPED! Both rooms are so much fun. They're challenging and make you work as a team. The cool thing is you can make it as easy or difficult as you want by asking for more or less clues. Beyond all of the fun and craziness, Jared and his staff MAKE the experience! They are funny, helpful and cheering you on the whole time. Can't wait to go back and try their BIG room! (go easy on us)"

The elusive M has placed a series of codes that long to be cracked for access to The Blind Pig. Thankfully we were sharp enough to break through the mystery and escape with mere moments to spare!
