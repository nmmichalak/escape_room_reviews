Audrie was a great guide who did a wonderful job at helping us work through. And shoutout to Diego the zombie, hustle on point. Definitely would recommend to others."

My favorite room by far is zombie panic in which zombie Rochelle scared me to death, and my game master Grace was really sassy but fun! Keep up the good work!"

I have been to quite a few escape room places and this one is my favorite. I went there with a group and we did the zombie room. It completely delivered! It was scary (they also have other rooms so don't let the scare-factor turn you away) , and It introduced some puzzle elements I had never seen before. This, combined with numerous object puzzles and a really kind staff made the night very enjoyable. This place is a definite recommend for all escape room enthusiasts."
