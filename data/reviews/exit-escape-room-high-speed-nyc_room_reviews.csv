"Escape room ""High Speed NYC"" by Exit Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/exit-escape-room-high-speed-nyc,0,"I gotta say I was a disappointed with the room's production value and upkeep. It needs some renovation and upkeep. For instance, one of the items needed to show a number wasn't working and the dude had to radio us and say ""oh that one is supposed to be '2'"" for example"". At least he was paying attention. Another time an object was supposed to come out of a machine and it wasn't working so the dude had to knock on the door and hand us the object. Really broke the immersion of the game. Close the room for a week and fix these issues! 1/25/20"
"Escape room ""High Speed NYC"" by Exit Escape Room in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/exit-escape-room-high-speed-nyc,1,We did the High Speed NYC whilst on holiday last week and it was amazing. The puzzles are hi-tech and really get you thinking and the surprises keep coming throughout. Five of us played from age 13 - 54 and everyone was buzzing afterwards. We got out with less than a minute to spare!! Definitely recommend it.

The features inside the room were really cool - just like the inside of a real subway in NYC. I have to say, this was one of the best escape rooms in NYC - fun, exciting and as challenging as you'd like to make it. You can have more or less clues so this is good for beginners or more ""advanced"" escapers. As an added bonus, the owner is very pleasant and professional and goes the extra way to make sure you have a good experience. I look forward to returning."

It all makes sense in the end! Challenges you at every step. So many emotions and all worth it. I look forward to completing other escape rooms. I hope they all meet this standard. The staff member was polite, friendly, engaging and encouraging. I visited on 9/2/17. You will not regret doing this. ‚ù§üëåüëçüëè"
