"Escape room ""Hansel & Gretel: Chapter 2"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-hansel-and-gretel,0,This was our 4th time here. Each time was so much fun. I think my favorite so far has been the Hansel and Gretel room.

The room was decorated so perfectly and the puzzles were very clever. We did the Hansel & Gretel room, which they said was their hardest room. It was hard but we were able to complete it with just a few minutes to spare. Super fun!"
"Escape room ""Hansel & Gretel: Chapter 2"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-hansel-and-gretel,2,We had a team building activity here and it was great! The staff was so friendly and accommodating; they split 24 people up into 3 different rooms and we competed against each other to see who would get out the fastest. The room I was in was Hansel and Gretel and it is very difficult. We got out with 8 seconds to spare! I will definitely go again. Thank you!
