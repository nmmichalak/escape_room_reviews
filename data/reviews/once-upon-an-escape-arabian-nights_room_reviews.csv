"Escape room ""Arabian Nights"" by Once Upon An Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/once-upon-an-escape-arabian-nights,1,I have been to a lot of escape rooms in Vegas. This one was my favorite! My husband and I played the “Arabian Nights” room and are still talking about it weeks later. We can’t wait to go back to try the rest of the rooms!
"Escape room ""Arabian Nights"" by Once Upon An Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/once-upon-an-escape-arabian-nights,2,"So from the moment we walked in, my friends, wife and I were in awww with the place. The detail on the decor. The room we went into ""Arabian Nights"", was amazing. So much different obstacles and innovated techniques we ran into that I haven't seen in any other escape rooms before.The customer service though.... off the chain. Greeted, treat and cared by probably the best Game Master I've bumped into, ""Wayne"". The customer service on this guy is just on point. Made us feel great, answered questions, full of energy, and much more. Definitely recommend this place!"
