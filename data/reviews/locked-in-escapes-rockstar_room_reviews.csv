I just did the rock star room and I think it is my favorite. Unique puzzles, fun technology, and a good storyline. Looking forward to their new room in February"
"Escape room ""Rockstar: The Final Curtain"" by Locked In Escapes in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/locked-in-escapes-rockstar,1,"We've done a couple of other escape rooms that were both good, but the Rock Star room here was really impressive....and super hard. Even though we didn't make it, we were able to quickly go through the rest of the puzzles (with help) to see what we missed as she reset the room. I don't know if that's a normal practice since it's the first time we failed, but it was nice to get some closure.We had a bit of trouble finding it as it's kind of tucked away, but trust your GPS."
"Escape room ""Rockstar: The Final Curtain"" by Locked In Escapes in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/locked-in-escapes-rockstar,2,This escape room was so much fun! Very creative and interactive. Plus the clues for the locks are very creative. I loved it. The room design was very creative. Loved the clue and the escape room over all.
