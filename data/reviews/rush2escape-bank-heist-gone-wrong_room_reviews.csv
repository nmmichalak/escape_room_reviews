"Escape room ""Bank Heist Gone Wrong"" by Rush2Escape in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/rush2escape-bank-heist-gone-wrong,2,My group really enjoyed ourselves. It was very exciting and suspenseful. The puzzles were fun to accomplish and the staff helped to keep us organized (there are a lot of different things to keep track of at once). This really assisted in the flow of the room and it kept all of us occupied because we all had something to work on. Cooperation with your group is the key to success.
