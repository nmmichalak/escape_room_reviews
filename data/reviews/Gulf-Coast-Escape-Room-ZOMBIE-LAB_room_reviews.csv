First of all, they were actually closed on the day we wanted to do it but the owner opened it up just for us! It was my son's 18th birthday and we wanted to do something different- this was definitely the right choice! We had a blast! There were 6 of us, and we did the Zombie Room - it was really tough, but we did it! In 51 minutes! KUDOS to Gulf Coast Escape Room for a very cool experience that we will never forget!!"
