"Escape room ""Captive"" by Boulder Escape Room in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/boulder-escape-room-captive,2,This was an excellent experience!!!! We booked at the last minute and had the best time. We did the Captive room (20% success rate) - it was quite tricky but we made it!!! We're big escape room fans and went with our friends who had never done an escape room before. They loved it just as much as we did. Our host was excellent and gave us clues at the perfect time. We found the puzzles to be appropriately difficult - sometimes escape rooms have clues that are very obscure and aren't very logical. Highly recommend this one!
