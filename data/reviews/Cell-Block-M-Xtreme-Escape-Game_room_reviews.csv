"Escape room ""The City Morgue"" by Xtreme Escape Game in Marco Island",https://worldofescapes.com/marco-island/quests/Cell-Block-M-Xtreme-Escape-Game,0,"Loved our experience at Xtreme Escape. We did the Cell Block room and successfully escaped. It was challenging and fun. Howie was great, very personable and helpful. We had 7 in our group - a mix of teens, 20s, 40s and 50s and fun was had by all. Will definitely be back!"

When my friends and I walked into Cell Block M, we were excited and freaked out at the same time. Slowly, we figured out one clue after another and luckily made it out just in time! What a thrill!This is definitely an activity for all ages. Whether it's for families, group of friends or coworkers, everyone will surely enjoy! I'm glad there's finally one in Southwest Florida! So instead of going to the usual: movies, mini golf, or the beach... Check this place out!Thank you to the staff for being so friendly, lively and accommodating!"
