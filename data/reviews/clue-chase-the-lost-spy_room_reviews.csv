"Escape room ""The Lost Spy"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-the-lost-spy,0,"As an escape room enthusiast, I thought Clue Chase was the best escape room experience I've ever had. For my husband's birthday, a group of us tried out The Lost Spy. It was incredibly put together and challenging. That room has a 14% success rate, and the five of us were able to complete it with a few minutes to spare. Our host, Austin, was just so awesome and hilarious! We enjoyed his company and the overall storyline and escape room. I look forward to going back and trying other rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Spy"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-the-lost-spy,1,"I cannot rave about Clue Chase enough. The staff was so wonderful, friendly, approachable, and accommodating last night for my husband's 30th birthday. We bought out two rooms (Lost Spy and Egyptian Tomb). We came from a large birthday dinner and I had a hard time wrangling everyone to get down to Clue Chase so we were late. David, Ross, and another wonderful man who I unfortunately did not get the name of were so kind and helpful, Ross even going out into the cold to wave down my lost family members from out of town! I highly recommend the escape rooms at Clue Chase. They're well done and the staff is unparalleled. We'll definitely be back. Thank you again!"

Challenging but a ton of fun; if you're looking for something to do with friends and/or family, I'd highly recommend it. Excellent alternative to movie/bar/""the usual"" - the owners put in a ton of work on this experience and it shows. Happy chasing!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Spy"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-the-lost-spy,3,"The lost spy- Cold War mission was a blast. There was so much to do that our group of 6 was busy from start to finish. The room and clues were well designed and in theme. The staff was friendly and helpful- we were briefed prior to the mission, he'd pop in during the hour and provide tips to guide us, and reviewed all the clues and how everything fit together afterwards. I'd love to come back and do the Egyptian tomb room and I highly recommend this place for an escape room experience. Make sure to arrive early so you have time to check in at the front desk of the building."
"Escape room ""The Lost Spy"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-the-lost-spy,4,"Our group did the lost spy-cold war mission room and had a blast. We had a group of 6 and there was lots to do to keep us busy during the entire hour. The room and clues were well thought out and in theme throughout the mission. The guy on staff Saturday was very friendly and helpful- he gave us tips prior to starting the escape room, popped into the room to help guide us, and took time out to review all the clues that we got and missed after the hour was up. It was great to do the walk through after because during the mission I was so busy working on my part that I missed some of the clues that others in my group handled. It was great to see how it all got together. I highly recommend this place if you are looking to do an escape room. This was the first one I attempted although 2 people in my group had done one previously at another location. Make sure to arrive early because you need to check in at the front desk of the building before you can head down to clue chase."
