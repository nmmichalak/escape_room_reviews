"Escape room ""Pirate Captives"" by 11th Hour Escape in Corpus Christi",https://worldofescapes.com/corpus-christi/quests/11th-hour-escape-pirate-captives,1,Went with my friends for my birthday and had a great time in the Pirate room. We will definitely be back with a group of friends to try out their other room. Enjoyed meeting with the owners afterwards. Great fun for groups of all ages.
