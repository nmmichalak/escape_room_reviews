My group did ""The Island"" breakout and had a great time. The thing we liked most was that the objective made sense. Other breakout rooms I have participated in seem like random clues that fit random tasks but this one was different. We understood what we were supposed to do and worked together to get the tasks done. Our final time was 48 min 12 seconds, and we had a blast!"
