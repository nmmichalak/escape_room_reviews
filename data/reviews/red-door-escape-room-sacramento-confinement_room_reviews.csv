Not only was the challenge a blast but the employees we interacted with were amazing!!! Austin was our game master and he was great! He went above and beyond from the moment we got there. There was also a girl working who was just as awesome. We will definitely recommend this to everyone and we will be back soon!!"

Our game master sandy was amazing! We have done a lot of escape rooms and this is one of the best. The tasks made sense but we're still challenging.  We will be back!

We did the co confinement room and we were SOOOOOOO close to finishing. The clues were well thought out, great set up and multiple rooms made for a challenging and exciting time. It brought us together and the kids keep talking about it days afterward. Zahara, our host, was amazing, super friendly and helpful. Definitely will go again!"
