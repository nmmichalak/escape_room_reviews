"Escape room ""The Office of Professor R. K. Alogee"" by Mighty Awesome Escape Rooms in San Marcos (CA)",https://worldofescapes.com/san-marcos-ca/quests/mighty-awesome-escape-rooms-the-office,0,"This was for a work team outing, and it was a blast. Only one other person had done any escape room before, so it was a new experience for everyone else. Cory was extremely flexible in scheduling and a great host. We did the ""Archeology"" room, and it was tough to get started. Cory gave some well-timed hints that didn't spoil the joy of discovery which was just right. I would highly recommend this place!"

Great business and very nice folks. It was harder than I thought, but I liked the challenge!"

To start, we found parking right away which is always a plus. The waiting room has tons to do while your'e waiting and the bathroom is in the business, it's not a 1-mile trip through an elaborate maze like some of the other games I played.The scenario: What made this great was the hint system, not to much was information given, but it was just enough to make things clear if you are unsure of your next step. We played as a group of two and it was awesome, but I would definitely recommend four or more to play. The scenario was set up well and we knew our mission.If you find yourself in San Marcos, go to Mighty Awesome, you'll have memories that will last far longer than watching TV in your hotel room."

My family and I have done around two dozen escape games, and it's very clear which ones are well thought out and which aren't. Cory is so very clearly passionate about what he does and it shines through in every detail of the games: from the story to the scenery to the riddles and clues. One of our top escape experiences for sure!"
