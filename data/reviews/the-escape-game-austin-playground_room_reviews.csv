"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game Austin in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/the-escape-game-austin-playground,0,Awesome experience! This was our first time in an escape room and we did the Playground. I loved the small details that they have and they made you think and work as a team. It's a really good experience. I would love to do it again!So recommendable for all ages.

We had such an AWESOME TIME at the Playground! Don't let the name fool you. It was tough, but we managed to escape in 40 minutes with only 1 clue. Thank you Escape Game! We can't wait to try out the other games soon."
