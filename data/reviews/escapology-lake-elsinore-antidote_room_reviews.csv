"Escape room ""Antidote"" by Escapology Lake Elsinore in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/escapology-lake-elsinore-antidote,0,We were one of the lucky ones to test out the Antidote room before the Grand Opening... It was such a great experience. The staff was great! Canâ€™t wait to try out the other rooms..

The lounge and bar area is beautiful! Took three 14 year old boys and one other Adult to the ""Antidote"" room. The boys had so much fun they asked if we could come back tomorrow morning and do another one! We've been to another escape room in Temecula and this one is so much better. Only complaint is maybe 90 mins would be better than 60 and the intercoms they use to talk to you are really hard to understand what they're saying. Overall great experience!"

I surprised my husband and went with him and our 9 and 12 year old children. We were in the Antidote room, which was perfect for first-timers like us. We all had a blast. Our game host Nick, and Game Master Ferd did an excellent job of helping us keep the game moving along. We were always engaged and working towards our next clue. Definitely worth the price."
