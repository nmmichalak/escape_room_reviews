"Escape room ""Reactor Escape"" by Reason in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/reason-reactor,0,"Our team had a blast solving the puzzles to break out of the escape room! We did this as a team bonding activity to kick off the new year and it was incredibly effective. We were able to play with a drone, a 3D printer, virtual reality, and other technologies as part of the puzzles which only made the experience more fun!"

I was absolutely blown away by the puzzle design, game flow, and hospitality of the room hosts. I've done a lot of escape rooms, and this one stands out with inventive puzzles that required lots of teamwork. Our gamemasters were very patient, encouraging, and provided an excellent customer service experience."

We had a group of 10 people (some new to escape games) and we escaped with a few seconds left! It was an awesome and unique experience with the technology that they use.

It was fun, exceptionally designed, and clever. We were lucky enough to participate in the beta so learned more about the design and testing process they went through. I look forward to exploring (and escaping) the next Reason room."
