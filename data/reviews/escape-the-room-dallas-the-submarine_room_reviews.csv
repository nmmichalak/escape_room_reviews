We had a fun time working together as a team to find clues had different levels of complexity. Never a dull moment working as a team and each contributing to an outstanding event."
"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-the-submarine,2,We took a group of 8 into the Submarine and really had a great time. There were lots of puzzles so everyone had a chance to contribute. Some good opportunities for cooperation. I loved the detail in the implementation of the sub. The details made it even more fun. This particular one is probably better for older kids and adults. Some of the other rooms at this location might be better for a younger audience.
