"Escape room ""Room 1409"" by Locked Up Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/locked-up-philly-room-1409,0,"Well constructed room. Countdown clock in room. Doesn't have the typical combination lock puzzles; instead uses some clever and novel ways to ""unlock"" the next puzzle. It's mildly creepy without being overboard scary or unnerving. Some puzzles can be done in parallel, some in series. Suitable for small groups. Overall a fun room."

The room was very well put together and engaging. The puzzles were solid and and the tech functioned seamlessly, which made for a great experience. We cannot wait to come back when the new room become available in February!!"

"Escape room ""Room 1409"" by Locked Up Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/locked-up-philly-room-1409,3,We celebrated our friend's birthday here last night and we had a blast! I never did an escape room before so I wasn't sure what to expect. They definitely left a great impression. We did room 1409. The puzzles we had to solve were very clever but not impossible. When we got stuck they would give us clues to get back on track. I will definitely be returning to try the other escape room!
