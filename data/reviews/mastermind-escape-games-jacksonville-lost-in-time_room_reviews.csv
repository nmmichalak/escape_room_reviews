"Escape room ""Lost In Time"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/mastermind-escape-games-jacksonville-lost-in-time,0,I went with my coworkers as a team building night out and we all had a blast! We had a group of 7 and did Lost in Time. The puzzle were great and it was interesting seeing each of our strengths outside of work. We worked with Amber and she was sweet and accommodating. They are lucky to have such a nice person working there.Thank you for a fun and brain-bending night out. My team needed this!
