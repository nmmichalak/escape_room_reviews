Bob was perfectly in character from beginning to end, fun to work with, and clear on instructions.The room itself was interesting and had an amazing storyline and never-before-seen challenges. I highly recommend it for first timers and escape room enthusiasts alike!!"
"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Get the F Out in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/get-the-f-out-the-experiment,1,I had a great time at The Experiment Room. Not gonna lie I was a bit scared haha but the room was well thought out and we escaped right at the buzzer! I liked how the room had a back story and the owner took his time to walk us through everything. You can see he really has a passion to create escape rooms. Can't wait to try The Virus!
