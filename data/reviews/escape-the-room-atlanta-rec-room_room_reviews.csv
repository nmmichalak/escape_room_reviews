It's a terrificly challenging, funny, mind boggling, creativity-inspiring 60 minutes that is a blast for everyone! There were seven in my group plus three strangers and we all pulled it together and almost escaped the apartment. Even in times when we didn't know what to do, we tried anything and everything to escape that room. Unfortunately we found all keys except one but will definitely be back to try the other two rooms. It's a great great great place to visit. P.S. The staff were awesome too."

I went for my line sisters birrhday and wished we had more time to escape the room. We didn't win, but we came close. You really have to use your brain and think logical. I plan on going back and doing a different room."
