"Escape room ""The Grimm Escape"" by Puzzle Break Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-break-li-the-grimm-escape,0,"We went this evening and participated in the Grimm Fairy Tales room. There were only four of us (but we purchased all the spaces so it was guaranteed only to be our group). We had so so much fun! The room was their toughest and we knew this going in. We worked so hard and the hour flew by. The worker in the room with us was amazing! Helpful when we needed it without giving TOO many clues as we wanted to stay away from clues if possible. We didn't finish although we got to last clue as our time ran out. Definitely a tough room, but so much fun! The facility is great. Rooms are clean and everything is well organized. We can't wait to go back."

Took her and 13 of her friends to dinner at Oheka and then spent an hour busting out! It was a blast. Not really for kids as it's hard but the guide was great. Will definitely go back.

We came back today with a group of 14-year-olds celebrating their 8th-grade graduation. Such a good time. We were in the Grimm room, and it was fun and super challenging. The puzzles were unique. Thanks to ""Unlimited hints"" and our involved guide we got out with 1 minute 24 seconds to spare. Highly recommend Puzzle Break Long Island."
"Escape room ""The Grimm Escape"" by Puzzle Break Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-break-li-the-grimm-escape,4,"We did Grimm, the hardest of the 3 rooms that Puzzle Break can offer. It was definitely a challenge taking us 59 minutes and 42 seconds to get out. Special thanks to our great guide Maggie (the game master stays in the room while you play). The room itself was spacious and the puzzles were varied. Go check it out, you'll have fun!"
