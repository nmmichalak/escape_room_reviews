"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-island-escape,0,I love playing all the games I have played!

If you're looking for a fun activity to do with family or friends, I highly suggest checking this place out. My sorority went as a bonding retreat, so they are very accommodating for large groups. My group was in the island escape room and had a blast trying to figure out the clues. Our game master Mason did a great job of explaining what to do before we got started and gave us clues along the way."
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Indianapolis in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/breakout-games-indianapolis-island-escape,2,Island Escape was a good room which my wife and I were able to beat together. The room was challenging with tons of puzzles. Minor little things about the style of the game as well as the beat-up condition of the South Indy location reduced my rating to 4-stars. But it was a good room overall and I would recommend to medium sized groups new to escape rooms.

Our voice in the sky, Alex aka God was a hoot and made it very enjoyable. We'll definitely return for another adventure."

Our game master was incredibly patient with us. We didn't make it out in time but had so much fun. Would absolutely do it again!"

It was our first time so I wasn't sure what to expect. We did the Island Escape. The boys told me they didn't want my help unless they were really stuck, and they didn't end up needing help from me. They did call out for a couple clues, but they were able to break free! At dinner afterwards, they were already planning their next trip back."
