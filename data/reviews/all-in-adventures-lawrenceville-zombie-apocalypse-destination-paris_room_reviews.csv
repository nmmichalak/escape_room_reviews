"Escape room ""Zombie Apocalypse - Destination Paris"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-zombie-apocalypse-destination-paris,1,Really fun and only $20!! Some friends and I from out of town really enjoyed this escape room! We did the Zombie Apocalypse Level 2. It had a 15% success rate and we would have made it through if we weren't just one number off! You have 50 minutes to find clues and get out and it was a blast!
