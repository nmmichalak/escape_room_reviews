"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb Escape"" by Master Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/The-Master-Escape-Room-The-Egypt-Tomb-Escape,0,"We went as a family (ages 8, 15, 17 and parents) for my daughter's 15th b-day. She wanted to try the Egyptian room and we were blown away by the intricacies and level of puzzles. We escaped (my daughter and husband are gamers) with 15 seconds left! It was so much fun we can't wait to go back. So much happened in the hour we were trying to recall everything and what was in all the rooms. The puzzles and decor were so professional that we are now spoiled by this company. Don't waste your money at other places. The staff was very professional and friendly too!"
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb Escape"" by Master Escape Room in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/The-Master-Escape-Room-The-Egypt-Tomb-Escape,1,This is my second time coming here I had previously been here last year. I went with a group of friends for my wife's birthday celebration and we had a great time. We barely made it out of the Egyptian Tomb with just 40 secs left but we had a blast figuring it all out. We definitely had to work together and do our part to get it solved. By the time the hour was up we were exhausted but relieved to have walked out victorious.The staff was very helpful in explaining the rules to those playing for the first time. I will definitely be back again. Just waiting for them to open up the Dinosaur one.

I think this was the 11th escape room we have done so far. We did the Egyptian game and it surpassed all our expectations. The puzzles were fresh and interesting. It was one of the most challenging rooms I have done but still great fun.The rooms were easy to navigate, and at no point did we feel trapped or anything and there was even a fan inside to help keep us cool.Sadly, we didn't escape. I will definitely come back to play the other rooms!"

My friends and I had a great time! It was 8 of us in the Egyptian burial site room. We were so clueless at first. I had no idea what i was doing in the first 10mins maybe, but along the way, our combined brains (and a few free hints!) figured it all out. We had 4 minutes to spare when we got out. I highly recommend it!"

Very well thought out; the creativity and organization surpassed my expectations. My best escape room experience by far. Can't wait til they open the new room. Staff was phenomenal.
