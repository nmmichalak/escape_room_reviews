"Escape room ""Drago's Castle"" by 5 Wits in Buffalo",https://worldofescapes.com/buffalo/quests/5-wits-buffalo-dragos-castle,0,"My 12 year old daughter and I tried the tomb. We had never done anything like this and had a ton of fun! I was surprised at how well we worked together and solved each task, only having two people to complete them. We scored a 92 and made it through, so I think we did well. The storyline was fun. My daughter was a little scared when it got dark a few times, making it even better. Lol Glad to read the story changes bc we plan on coming back to do all three! Our guide was fun and helped us enjoy the experience. My only disappointment was that when we exited, no one said a word to us. We thought about doing another one if we had time, but no one acknowledge us or anything. I was waiting for someone to ask if we had fun or wanted to do another one. We went over and looked at our score and took a few pictures. Then we left. I was surprised, considering how great the staff were before we went in. Anyways, it was fun and we will be back!"

My family went there for the first time today, three kids ages 10, 7 and 4. It was perfect for the older 2 kids. A little over my 4 year Olds head but he still had a blast being part of it!  We did the castle and the space adventures. The castle one was by far my favorite, super fun with a slight challenge but still can figure it out. So fun!! The space one was super challenging. But still very fun. My husband and son loved that adventure more than the castle. Over all this was great to do and we will definitely be back! We are saving the tomb adventure for another day. The employees told us it might be a tad scary for the kids so date night perhaps? Can't wait for our next adventure!"
