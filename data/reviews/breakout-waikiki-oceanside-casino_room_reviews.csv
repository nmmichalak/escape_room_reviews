"Escape room ""Oceanside Casino"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-oceanside-casino,0,Today we did the Oceanside Casino. Our game master William was very helpful and always pointed/redirected us in the right direction. We made it out with a second to spare (literally - may have been less than that). It was probably one of the best rooms I did at Breakout Waikiki. Can't wait to go back to finish up my last two rooms!

Me and my family did the Oceanside Casino room (unfortunately, we did not escape). The staff is very friendly and try to help you out as much as possible. The clues and game itself were nicely challenging. I loved the layout of the room and the detail.If you love solving puzzles you won't be disappointed."

So much fun and the room was awesome! STEVE is the best,  hands down! He is energetic, funny, helpful, and wants to see every group succeed. He's been our room runner for all of the rooms we've done and each time only gets better because of him."
