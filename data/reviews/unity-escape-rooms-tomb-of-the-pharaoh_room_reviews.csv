"Escape room ""Tomb of the Pharaoh"" by Unity Escape Rooms in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/unity-escape-rooms-tomb-of-the-pharaoh,0,"My friend and I came to do Person of Interest but afterwards we asked if we could do the next two rooms and they were very accommodating. It was lots of fun because we got to meet the owner's parents and son who served as our Game Masters before the owner returned as our Game Master for the other two. As a person who grew up in a family business it was awesome to see dynamics like that still happen. The Tomb of the Pharaoh was our favorite of the three so if you can only do one while you're here, do that one! Can't wait to try their new room opening up soon. Thanks UNITY for the amazing customer service and for a fun night."
