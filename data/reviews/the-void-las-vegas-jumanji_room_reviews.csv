The whole VR experience was really thrilling for us. It was trippy, but it was really cool! The staff is also very warm and friendly. They were also patient with all our questions. Special shoutout to our guide, Sidney! She was very accommodating, and she's good at her job. Would definitely want to come back for more!"

The interactivity level raises the bar from Stars Wars and even Avengers...which are both great already. Staff friendly, and we were put in the experience right on time."
