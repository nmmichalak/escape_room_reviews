"Escape room ""Escape the X Corporation"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-x-corporation,0,"This place is so much fun! There was a group of 8 of us that did Escape the X Corporation room, this was definitely challenging! We did escape though! So we decided to do another room and did Starlight Lounge, but this was only with 6 people. This room was much easier than the first, but still made you think a lot. My tip is to not have everyone work on one thing, split up but communicate with each other very well, no matter which room you decide to do. I believe that 6 is the perfect amount of people to escape. We escaped the second room, breaking the record and becoming second on the leader board! #dinner2go  I will definitely be back to do other rooms!"
"Escape room ""Escape the X Corporation"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-x-corporation,1, My first escape room ever! Played it with 4 randoms and had a blast. It is a fairly medium-tech room (meaning theres is more to it than just finding keys and combinations) with great puzzles. I didn't find it too difficult at all. We escaped with 4 minutes left!

It was really fun even though we didn't escape in the end. Our host Frank was great, really funny. Parking is easy and there is a lot of it. The building is a little hard to see from the street, but we found it just fine."

I was in a group of 6, and were so jubilant when we escaped with 26 seconds to spare! Hints are helpful, use them wisely. Overall, it was a brain-pumping, adrenaline-rushing experience."
"Escape room ""Escape the X Corporation"" by Amazing Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/amazing-escape-room-x-corporation,4,"Way more involved, creative, fun and nerve wracking than I thought it would be! We had a GREAT time and can't wait to do the other rooms! It allowed us to work together as well as use our individual strengths to conquer each task! Also, the guy who greeted us was very welcoming and extremely friendly. I HIGHLY suggest trying this place out!"
