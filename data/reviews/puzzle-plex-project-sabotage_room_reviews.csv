The three rooms we did: Boring Life, Project 403, And Sabotage were exceptional with the last two as standouts. Can't recommend highly enough!"
"Escape room ""Project Sabotage"" by Puzzle Plex in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/puzzle-plex-project-sabotage,2,What an amazing experience we had. We had to split in two teams and play sabotages against each other. It was a race down to the wire where our team won with only one second to spare. I thought the clues were just enough to spread our time out and thoroughly enjoy our full hour.
