"Escape room ""The Closet"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-the-closet,1,"1st time doing an escape room.My friend and I picked ""the closet""  Having never done one, and being idiots ... we figured out the 1st clue and then were confused (the folks there were fun/friendly when we opened the door and were like ""what are you doing?!"") once we got back in we realized the process and managed to escape with time to spare... we are hopping to get another one in while my friend is in town if we can secure a sitter again ... good times, friendly folks.. I even booked the wrong date and called a few mins after when I realized the woman was super friendly and switched it no problem."
"Escape room ""The Closet"" by Just Escape Room in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/just-escape-room-the-closet,2,Amazing experience! Challenging and fun. We did the 20-minute room. The owners were attentive to all of our questions and concerns. We had a great time with our family. We can't wait to come back and try another room.
