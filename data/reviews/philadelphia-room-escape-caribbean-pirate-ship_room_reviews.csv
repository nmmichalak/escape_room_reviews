"Escape room ""Caribbean Pirate Ship"" by Philadelphia Room Escape in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/philadelphia-room-escape-caribbean-pirate-ship,0,I went with my cousins a couple weekends ago and we had a great time. We liked the Pirates theme and escaped! We got to speak with the woman running the place and she was very personable. I would recommend this place for a fun afternoon with friends or a team-building with colleagues.

We played both rooms by Philadelphia Room Escape. The interaction is good and the design of the puzzle is unbelievably awesome. It took us one and a half hour to escape from two rooms. I will suggest this to my friends.

Had a great experience with my friends and enjoyed the two themes very much. Some parts might be a little tricky but it turns out to be interesting after finding the truth. Highly recommend to other friends.
