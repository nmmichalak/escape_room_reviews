"Escape room ""Traitor"" by CQ Tactical in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/cq-tactical-traitor,0,"COMSUMER/BUYER BEWARE!!! If negative stars would be allowed they would recieve it. We called spoke to them about a booking. The employee said it would be fine and work. We made sure we had everything in place, and called back to book it. Now the manager said no. When we explained and even spoke with the employee he said was not allowing it. Customer service must not be a priority. They must not understand that without customers their doors would not be open. I can only hope that the owners of CQ Tactical conduct an internal review so other customer are not out $100.00, because they reneged on their agreement. We will not return, support, encourage, or even consider CQ again. They try to promote the name and experience as being supportive of the military, however when you give your word it is be honored. This is clearly not the same code of ethics here."
