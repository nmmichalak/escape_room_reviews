"Escape room ""Escape Plan"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-escape-plan,0,Came here for my daughter's 12th birthday. She went into the jail escape room with five of her friends and they ALL had blast! They can't wait to get back to see if they can finally escape the prison.
"Escape room ""Escape Plan"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-escape-plan,1,We did the Escape Room at the Buford location and it was the most fun any of us has had in a long time! It was great that all of us had a part in solving the many clues and eventually busting out of that jail! Can't wait to come back and try another one of the rooms.

So many pieces that were needed to complete the puzzle and so many pieces that just threw you off the trail of what you needed to do. Russell was our game master and he made it awesome from before we even got in the room! We had a great time and we will most definitely be back!"
