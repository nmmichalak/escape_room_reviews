"Escape room ""Jigsaw"" by Rooms of No Return in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/rooms-of-no-return-saw,1,"The room was great they really challenged you in this jigsaw escape. 4 rooms, the first room ,my group, found the most difficult because we over thought it;however, the other 3 rooms were great you must work together "
"Escape room ""Jigsaw"" by Rooms of No Return in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/rooms-of-no-return-saw,2,"My friends and I decided to try the Jigsaw themed escape room here, after work today. It was fun and challenging. It definitely requires everyone working together to get through all the clues. There were four rooms connected, and some were more challenging than others. Although we didn't make it out (just needed like 3 more minutes),  we all had a blast . I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you want to try something different."
"Escape room ""Jigsaw"" by Rooms of No Return in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/rooms-of-no-return-saw,3," Best escape game I've played in the Bakersfield area. This is a fun multi-room live escape game. It is well decorated. There is more ""stuff"" than you need to solve the puzzles, but it adds to the feel of the room. There is both searching and puzzles. It's a bit like a home haunt and an escape room had a baby. I recommend playing if you are in the Bakersfield area. The owners seem quite nice and passionate about the escape game industry."

That being said, these are still some of the most challenging (and well decorated) rooms in town."
