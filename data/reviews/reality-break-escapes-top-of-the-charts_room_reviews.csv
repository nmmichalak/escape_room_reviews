"Escape room ""Top of the Charts - Seattle Style"" by Reality Break Escapes in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/reality-break-escapes-top-of-the-charts,0,"I really enjoyed the top of the charts escape room. The idea of the room is to work together as a team to solve puzzles, but I really enjoyed how this room incorporated musical elements into the mix as well."
"Escape room ""Top of the Charts - Seattle Style"" by Reality Break Escapes in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/reality-break-escapes-top-of-the-charts,1,"I've done 2 rooms here -- the Speakeasy and Top of the Charts. Both were so much fun, although I liked Top of the Charts better. The puzzles are hard but not too hard, and they have a good variety. And their staff is so nice! I would definitely recommend this place to others."
"Escape room ""Top of the Charts - Seattle Style"" by Reality Break Escapes in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/reality-break-escapes-top-of-the-charts,2,"We do escape rooms regularly and were delighted that another area opened in Bellevue!   My wife and I did ""Top of the Charts"" together (we often try to duo, getting as far as we can).  It was a fantastic thematic room, on par with the best rooms in the area.  Lots and lots of content -- even if you are experienced with room escape rooms, I'd take 4 to this one.  The puzzles were varied, interesting, and fun. We will definitely go back for the other two rooms."
