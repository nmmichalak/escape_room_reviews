"Escape room ""Lottery Lost"" by Escape 812 in Indianapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/indianapolis/quests/escape-812-lottery-lost,0,"I had a great time finding Grandma's lottery ticket with my middle school aged kids and their friends. We didn't know what to expect when we got there, but the atmosphere was warm and inviting, the hostesses were friendly and helpful, and the game was challenging and super fun! I think it's a great way to spend an hour, and we can't wait to try another challenge :)"
