"Escape room ""X-Train"" by Xterious Escape in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/xterious-escape-x-train,2,"When my group got to the place it was a bit chaotic...multiple groups of people were waiting in the lobby so it was pretty warm. We got checked in and our game master played us an introduction video and explained the rules.Now onto the room, the room was one of the bigger rooms I've seen. There were numerous puzzles and props that our group had to split up to work on various things. We did have a timer in our room but it was inaccurate (10 min ahead) which made everyone stress because we thought we were running behind. This room does need a few improvements but the concept is really cool and unique and emphasizes the importance of working together and being a team player. When we first got into the room, one of the locked boxes was already open so that may have been overlooked during the resetting of the room. My friend also found a worm (live) inside one of the bins (black bin near the door) so make sure to check before reaching in there. There were also instances where we had to take something from one room to a different room to solve the puzzle which I thought could be confusing to newbies.Overall very fun experience and I believe this company has a lot of potential. Thanks Xterious Escape."
