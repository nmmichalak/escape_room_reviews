"Escape room ""The Bathhouse & Gambler"" by Escape Hot Springs in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/escape-hot-springs-the-bathhouse-n-gambler,1,"We held our annual company Christmas party on December 19th in the Bathhouse Gambler escape room and it was SO MUCH FUN!! This was the first escape room experience for the majority of the group and they were nervous about getting started. But the room was very engaging and interesting, so they got into it right away. The puzzles/problems were a great combination of difficulty and cleverness that picked the brains of even the seasoned escape room participants. Everyone loved the Hot Springs theme and were talking about it for days after we played. Everyone agrees we will return soon to play the two other rooms!! "
