"Escape room ""Pirate's Revenge"" by Exodus Escape Adventures in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/exodus-escape-adventures-pirates-revenge,0,"We were super impressed with Exodus Escape Adventures! It was our first escape room experience, and it was great family fun. The Pirate’s Revenge room was the perfect balance of challenge (we didn’t make it out in time) and fun (we still had so much fun). The lighting, the set, the props were all perfect fits to set the right atmosphere for a midnight adventure. Hope to come again soon!"

Not only was the set spectacular and immersive, the puzzles were challenging and our game master (forgot his name sorry!)was amazing. We will def be back for their new room in January!!"
"Escape room ""Pirate's Revenge"" by Exodus Escape Adventures in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/exodus-escape-adventures-pirates-revenge,2,"I've played well over 150 escape rooms and their Pirate themed room here is epic!!! You can't miss this amazing Pirate adventure. The set design here is phenomenal. You'll be experiencing an adventure in ways that other local escape rooms just don't offer. I brought my friend who had never played an escape room before, and he caught the bug and we can't wait until they open their new room so we can go back and check out what other amazing things they can create. Our game master was really fun and the backstory was very well themed too. A good time was had by all."
