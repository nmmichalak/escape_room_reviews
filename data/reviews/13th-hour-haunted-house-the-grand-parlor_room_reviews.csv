"Escape room ""The Grand Parlor"" by 13th Hour Haunted House in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/13th-hour-haunted-house-the-grand-parlor,0,My favorite haunted house ever.  The actors here are really really awesome.  We also did the Grand Parlor escape room and the actors there were also amazing.  Everybody was high energy and no one half assed it.  The escape room was challanging we had nine people and got out with nine minutes left but it was by far the biggest room or rooms I have ever seen and we have done about 40.  I would give them and extra star if I could.  Going back for another escape room is definitely in our future!  Thanks for a fun nite.

It was the biggest room I've ever seen by far, and I've been to about 40 rooms. The actors were amazing and went all-in for us! The puzzles were challenging but we got out with nine minutes left. Going back for another escape room is definitely in our future!"

I've previously done rooms by 13th Hour and the production quality is top-notch. The game was huge with multiple levels and rooms, all the puzzles were fair and obvious once you realized what you need to. Worth every penny of the price tag. We did it on a regular night with no actors involved but it didn't detract from the game. It still had its creepy ambiance but was everything I could ask for. 10/10 recommend."
