"Escape room ""Ivan’s Lair (Nightmare Part 2)"" by Legends of Xscape in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/legends-of-xscape-nightmare-on-datura-st,0,Very fun escape room. This is my 4th one I've ever done and needless to say detective Ryan was the highlight of it. I love that they didn't have radio and used the screen. It made it all the more interesting. We did Ivan's room and all the puzzles were interesting and all the clues were just right to solve it all. Welcoming us with Ryan and the other lovely lady were very nice and made our entire group comfortable enough to take on Ivan! Can't wait to come back for Area 51 and Houdini.

We did Ivan's Lair. Very well done room!  It was challenging yet not frustrating. The room had a nice and logical flow which challenged you to use your third eye and abandon conventional thinking. Bravo for a well-structured game!  Jody was great to deal with when booking and Zak was an awesome game master. Thanks for a great time. EW LILW EB KABC!!  Decode that!
