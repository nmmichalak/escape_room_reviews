"Escape room ""King Tut's Tomb 1922"" by Time to Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/time-to-escape-king-tuts-tomb,4,"Went to the KING TUT Escape Room of theirs with some strangers and it was even better than their Alcatraz room! This room is definitely more challenging, the puzzles are complex and require you to really pay attention, without taking you away from the fun and excitement. I was with a group of very smart girls so we completed it with 6 minutes to spare, you definitely have to be on your toes for this one!The room was very well done, you have to use lamps inside to see which made it so intense and all of the art, the sculptures, the tomb, every singe prop and set piece felt real and authentic, I didn't feel like I was playing a game; I was ready to bust out some Indiana Jones moves to get us out of there!I hear they're adding another room in February and it's a guarantee that we'll be back!
