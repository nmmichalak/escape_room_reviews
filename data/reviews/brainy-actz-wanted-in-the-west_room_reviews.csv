"Escape room ""Wanted in the West"" by Brainy Actz in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/brainy-actz-wanted-in-the-west,0,"This was hands down my favorite escape room that I have done.  I started doing escape rooms a couple months ago, but this one totally went beyond my expectations.  6 of us did the room, Wanted in the West, which was recommended by the sales rep for first timers.  We finished the room in about 40 minutes with no hints!  The puzzles were fun and challenging while still being reasonable.  The room was super duper cool, well set up, and kept us on our toes.  We had some trouble with payment, but everyone was very helpful in getting it all taken care of.  The staff was kind and friendly.  The overall experience was five stars, and I hope to do more rooms like this one!"
