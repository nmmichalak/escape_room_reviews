Reserving the space was easy, we were greeted quickly and the games were a BLAST. For my first experience I couldn't have asked for anything else, perfection! Thank you for helping us come together after a long year. Highly recommend for work group, family or friends. The hour went by FAST and it was just a great time all around."
