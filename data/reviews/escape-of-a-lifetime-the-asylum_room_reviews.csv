"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Escape Of A Lifetime in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-of-a-lifetime-the-asylum,0,"I want to start off saying it's in the parking lot of where your GPS will send you, then you'll see a sign and it's in a little hidden building in the parking lot.So our host Vinny was awesome! really kind and helpful! he explained things very well.My group did the asylum, which is very challenging and will take you the full hour. You can call and ask for help three times which is nice.This was my first escape room and i enjoyed it very much and would definitely come back!"

We had the insane asylum room which pretty much describes spending a day with 9 14 year olds. The game master was very helpful, we needed all 3 clues BUT we did complete the room, escape and had 10 minutes to spare!! Lots of fun to watch the girls try to work together and think out side the box. I highly recommend everyone try this experience atleast once - this was my 2nd escape room and I think you get better as you do more of them. Great friend or team building exercise. I will be back to try the bank vault next."

When you ask for a hint, they walk straight into the room, tell you the answer and walk out. Overall a bad experience."
