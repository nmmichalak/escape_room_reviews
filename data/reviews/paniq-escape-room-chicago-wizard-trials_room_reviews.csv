"Escape room ""Wizard Trials"" by PanIQ Escape Room Chicago in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/paniq-escape-room-chicago-wizard-trials,0,"We were anxiously awaiting the opening of the logan square location (because we already escaped from their other location) and had a blast. We did 2 rooms this day. The first, wizard trials went extremely smooth, but in red wire room we ran into some glitches. Since it was the first time anyone had done it i can totally understand. We had about a 10 minute wait to try and resolve the issue to no avail. Had to skip some of the locks:(."
