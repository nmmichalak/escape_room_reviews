"Escape room ""Dream Traveler"" by FLEE in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/FLEE-Dream-Traveler,0,"Our group tried the Dream Traveler room. The atmosphere was fantastic, and it gets better from one room to another (this is also my first multi-room experience). The backstory really helped enhance the puzzle because it's not just about brute forcing through a mental exercise that can be placed anywhere without context.Definitely would come back to try other rooms!"
