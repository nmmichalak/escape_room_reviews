"Escape room ""Ivan's Room"" by Kato Escape Room in Mankato",https://worldofescapes.com/mankato/quests/kato-escape-room-ivans-room,0,It was the first escape room my group has done and we had a good time. We look forward to trying the other rooms in the future. We did Ivans Will and found a good balance of clue trails to follow and things to find and discover. Any family or group should find it a good time for a reasonable rate.
