"Escape room ""Subject Zero"" by Exit Strategy in Charlotte",https://worldofescapes.com/charlotte/quests/exit-strategy-subject-zero,0,This was my first escape room experience and the game master and staff made it awesome! My group played the Subject Zero room. It was challenging but my group worked well together to beat. I want to give a big shout out to the awesome game master. I highly recommend Exit Strategy North.

We joined 6 others we did not know and we worked together to escape! Thank you, Travis, for making our experience a great one and for coaching us well all the way to the finish! We'll be back to play Ruins, for sure!"

Our group of 4 was paired with 4 ""strangers"", but it was a great group and didn't feel awkward at all. All of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Aaron hosted us and monitored our progress through the room, and he was phenomenal. He was helpful when we needed him but not overbearing. Lots of fun and a great experience tonight from start to finish."
