"Escape room ""Rogue A.I."" by Perplexium in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/perplexium-rogue-ai,0,"Went here for my birthday. AWESOME! It was hard, and (SPOILER ALERT) we lost. But it was fun! :-)"
"Escape room ""Rogue A.I."" by Perplexium in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/perplexium-rogue-ai,1,"Went to the AI room the week it was released.  It was not as polished as some of the other puzzle rooms I have been to, which is expected for such a new room.  However, the concept and interaction with the ""AI"" made this one of the best puzzle room experiences I have had."
"Escape room ""Rogue A.I."" by Perplexium in Austin",https://worldofescapes.com/austin/quests/perplexium-rogue-ai,2,"I made plans for a group of strangers to come and try out this escape room. I didn't know what to expect. The puzzles were challenging and interactive. To not give away any spoilers, I did the A.I. room and apparently, there is a different ending depending on how you play the game. My group solved the room, in not record time, but we had fun and frustrating moments. Be prepared to communicate with each other and speak up!"
