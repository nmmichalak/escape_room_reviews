"Escape room ""Insane Asylum"" by PanIQ Escape Room San Jose in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paniq-escape-room-san-jose-insane-asylum,0,The rooms at the PanIQ Escape Room location in San Jose are incredible. The Wild West Room was beautiful and the Insane Asylum had me jumping! The creators did a great job integrating hints and puzzles into the actual build of the room. Can't wait to try the third room!

It was our first time ever doing an escape room and we all loved it! Our group of six went into the Asylum room. Romeo helped us through it, he was great! We probably asked for more clues than most people and he was always ready to answer our questions and help us figure out how to get to the next step. The room itself was really cool. The first part is a padded room and the other two were dark and scary. So much fun!"

When my friend said ""hey want to do an escape room"" I jumped at the chance and said yes before I even knew the theme. I got super excited then she said... ""it's called Insane Asylum"".We basically got locked into a padded cell that was creepy as hell and had try to find our way out. While I was creeped out the entire time, I had a great time figuring out the puzzles, it definitely got my mind off the blood on the walls.Jonathan the game attendant was super nice, helpful and funny. He gave great hints that were never too revealing which kept it challenging and fun for us.We will definitely be back for their third and most difficult room."
