"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-mansion-murder,2,"This place is really great. At this point I've done about 50 escape rooms across the country. The rooms here are well themed. They are also very lock/puzzle intensive, but at times one thing would hold up all the players because one puzzle was needed to continue the game, which makes time super valuable. We've done anecdote and Mansion Murder,  and we were able to escape both. We are very excited to try the rest! Definitely recommend if you're in the area."
