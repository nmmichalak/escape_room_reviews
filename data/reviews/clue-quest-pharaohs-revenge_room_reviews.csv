"Escape room ""Pharaoh's Revenge"" by Clue Quest in Oklahoma City",https://worldofescapes.com/oklahoma-city/quests/clue-quest-pharaohs-revenge,0,"We went tonight for the first time! We did the Pharaoh's Revenge room. It was such a fun time. The clues were very well thought out, and while you had to work for them, it wasn't ever frustrating. The people are so nice and enthusiastic, and you can tell they really love what they do. This was the best double date night ever!! The mystery/puzzle nerd in me is fully satisfied."
