We were in the Tornado room. I have read where a few others didn't get the connection to a tornado. No, that wasn't needed. You are trapped underground and searching for a way to ground level. Go find out the rest for yourself. You'll be glad you did üòä!"

They were seasoned veterans of escape rooms, we were not. Lots of fun! The personal ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moments are awesome. We did tornado alley, fun puzzles and we got out in time, 10 seconds to spare! A great time for escape artists at any level! Thanks!"
