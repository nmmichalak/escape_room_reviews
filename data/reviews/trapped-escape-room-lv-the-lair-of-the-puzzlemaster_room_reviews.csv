Puzzles are ok.  Staff was friendly."

Escape Room in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/trapped-escape-room-lv-the-lair-of-the-puzzlemaster,1,We played the lair of the puzzlemaster and loved it. The room was challenging and very well designed with some really cool effects. We go to escape rooms pretty often and were very impressed with this one. We'll be going back to try the other rooms in the future!!

The Puzzlemaster room was my first escape room experience, and I had a great time. The puzzles were challenging without being impossible, and even though we had to call in a few hints, there weren't any penalties for getting hints. It requires a lot of creative thinking and problem-solving skills, and the room design is great. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Overall a fantastic experience."

Make sure you come ready to think and act, because this room isn't for the simple minded. We will definitely be coming back for the other rooms. The staff was amazing, and incredibly helpful. Wish I could give them more than 5 stars"
