"Escape room ""Home Alone"" by LI Escape Game in Riverhead",https://worldofescapes.com/riverhead/quests/escape-the-room-game-li-mysterious-time-warp,0,This was a great experience and we want to come again with a larger group next time. My fiance and I came by ourselves and were paired with a group of people. Our host Brittney was incredibly helpful and friendly. We did the time warp puzzle and had such a blast. Highly recommend this place as a group activity.

We were a group of 6, all our first time in an escape room! We did the time warp room. We did end up using all our clues but it was fun trying to figure out the clues together! Will definitely come back!"

This time we did the Time Warp room, bringing a full set of ten people. It was the best room we've done so far. Some rooms have issues with not having enough puzzles, or having the clues be not contiguous to the subject matter. This room was stellar (pun intended) with plenty of opportunities or everyone to solve and participate.Our team has done ten rooms so far as a group, and we all agree that this one is one of our favorites thus far. Thanks Madison and Brittany!"

So my friend suggested the Escape Room in Ronkonkoma.I rented both rooms and we had the boys compete against the girls. A great time was had by all. The girls lost and they can't wait for a rematch."

We were in the time warp room which was modified for their age. Everyone had fun and staff were extremely helpful! Zack and Madison were very friendly and attentive!
