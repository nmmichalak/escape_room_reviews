"Escape room ""Escape from Seattle - the World's Fair Affair"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-escape-from-seattle-the-worlds-fair-affair,1,Puzzle Break is really one of my favorite places to go.

"Escape room ""Escape from Seattle - the World's Fair Affair"" by Puzzle Break in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/puzzle-break-escape-from-seattle-the-worlds-fair-affair,2,"Puzzle Break is the best - their staff is amazing and the rooms are SUPER well designed. I've done a few puzzle rooms with other companies that don't even come close to the experience you get with Puzzle Break. I've done the 20,000 leagues under the sea, as well as the Seattle-themed World's Fair room. Both were very well designed with really unique puzzles and really really cool technology. Highly recommend."
