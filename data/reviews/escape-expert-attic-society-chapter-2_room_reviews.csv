I went with my co-workers and we did the attic room which has a 40% escape rate; we solved it with just over 2 minutes to go. The owners are so lovely and they really give you all the tools you need to be successful if you listen and implement them. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend Escape Expert for groups, corporate events, etc!!!"

We were paired with another group in the attic room. The puzzle was challenging but not frustratingly impossible. We were so close to finishing but unfortunately we didn't. Definitely we would do again.
