"Escape room ""Coma"" by Dare To Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dare-to-escape-az-coma,0,The escape room was very well put together with a good theme. We had a great time solving all the clues. Though it took us a little longer then an hour to solve they allowed us to stay and finish without kicking us out of the room. Definitely recommend!

The staff was helpful but not to much where they give away the rides. It challenged our intellect and pushed our minds to really think about the clues! Had a blast we shall enjoy back again. Thank you!!
