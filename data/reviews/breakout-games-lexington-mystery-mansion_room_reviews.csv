"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/breakout-games-lexington-mystery-mansion,0,Took a bunch of 12 year olds for my sonâ€™s birthday party. My husband and I went just to watch their thought processes. We had a blast in the mystery mansion room. We also went to another island escape at this location. We will definitely be back.

It was SO MUCH FUN! There were multiple layers for the puzzles and as mid 20-somethings, the puzzles were adequately challenging but not frustrating. There was enough going on that all six of us could move around the set and work on different things without being bored or on top of each other. Our gamemaster was really fun and provided help if needed, but we didn't need may clues! "

We went with the Mystery Mansion room which was amazing. The staff was so friendly when we checked in and thoroughly explained how everything worked. They were super helpful when we were stumped and needed clues as well. I would recommend this to everyone because it's perfect for date night, families, and groups of people looking to have a fun night with a different twist. We will definitely be coming back for more fun!"

I went with some moms in a local moms group so we had a great group of people. We did the mystery mansion. It was a blast! I had so much fun!!! I had heard other experiences of people having a hard time solving other games due to employees lack of willingness to help. The guy we had guiding us through was awesome!!! One of the rules is, you all have to agree to get a clue. However, if he noticed that we were on the right track but kind of spinning our wheels, he would chime in. It really took some of the pressure and frustration out of it. I want to go back and try a couple more! This is a must try!"

The staff was very courteous and helpful (which we did need a few times)! We'll be back again!!
