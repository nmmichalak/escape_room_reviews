We completed the Cuban Missile Crisis, and just barely finished in time. We had an awesome time completing the escape and will definitely come back again to try the harder one with some friends. Awesome couples and team building activity, highly recommend."

Very professional, amazing decor, challenging but escapable room (Cuban Crisis), attentive cluemaster (Rosemary), and friendly and knowledgeable host (Casey). We have been to escape rooms in many cities and this ranks at the top! Can't wait to try the other rooms!"

I've visited others in town and nothing compares to Escapology! The detail in the rooms, the puzzles, and the staff was second to none! Our group loved Cuban Crisis! I would highly recommend Escapology to anyone looking for a fun activity for the whole family!"

I highly recommend going. We went today and escaped the Cuban Crisis room and had so much fun we scheduled another after lunch and did two in one day. Much attention to detail went into the planning of these rooms and it's well thought out. I've been to other escape rooms before, but none like this. The room appears authentic and you are really able to get into the game. I'll definitely be back for more."
