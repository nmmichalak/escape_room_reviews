We played “Death Row”. The puzzles were great, and really forced us to work as a team. We will definitely be returning if we’re ever passing through Cleveland again!"
"Escape room ""Death Row"" by Escape in 60 in Cleveland",https://worldofescapes.com/cleveland/quests/escape-in-60-death-row,1,"Came here with my co-workers for a fun experience and it was so much more than we expected. Our group of 8 did the death row room. It was challenging, but not impossible. Our group needed to get a few clues and escaped with seconds to spare! Mo was easy to work with for scheduling and the room was ready for us as soon as we arrived. Our group size was perfect for this room. So it was the perfect suggestion for us. I'd come again with this group or another of similar size. Definitely a great outing in downtown."
