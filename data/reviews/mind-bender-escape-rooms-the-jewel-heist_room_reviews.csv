It was a ton of fun! The puzzles are well thought out and just challenging enough to leave you with a sense of accomplishment no matter where you finish. I would totally do this again and bring friends!

I took my 14-year-old son and 3 of his friends. The room was challenging but not impossible. I helped when they got stuck but they didn't make it out. My husband and I are already planning on going back. The staff was super friendly and helpful, the rooms are set up very nicely, clean and safe facility. Definitely worth the cost for a fun adventure!"
