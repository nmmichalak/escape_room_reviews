It was so much fun! It was the most amazing time, and it was better than I ever imagined for my first ever escape room. I'm already making plans for the next time we visit."

We had a great time. We did the Runaway Train. The puzzles were challenging but solvable, which is important. We did get out, but at one point it seemed pretty bleak until one of us had a breakthrough that kept us going. It is a fast-paced hour, but still time to have fun and laugh at each other."
