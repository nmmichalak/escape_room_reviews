"Escape room ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-a-wrinkle-of-wormhole,0," I played so many escape rooms in my country China. Escape rooms there was like real sites of movies. I also played some other escape rooms in the Bay Area. I realized American escape rooms are so much different than China.Get back to this escape room. I came here by friend's recommendation. We tried the ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" it was really hard for us. There are so much details in the game that we have to remember and pay some attentions on it at the same time. And remember! Team work, team work, and team work! I felt I went to the gym after play this game. So tired but it was fun.I really recommend you to play this with your close friends since you have to do something together and yelling to each other's for those clues."
"Escape room ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-a-wrinkle-of-wormhole,1,I went there for my friend's birthday party. It was so fun. We played the Wrinkle of Wormhole. and get out of there in the last minutes. I played a few escape rooms in the bay area. So far this is the most challenging one. The room was dark and we have to interact in several different rooms at the same time. I love the story that a prodigy created the time machine and the last part was awesome. Unfortunately we cannot take a photo in there but it was so pretty. Base on the other reviews the other rooms are not that good but I'll definitely give a try.
"Escape room ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-a-wrinkle-of-wormhole,2,I recommend to try the wormhole game. That game has a difficult logic in it. Players have to travel between two years to make things right. There were a lot of things to do and my testing team finished in 57:58. That was a completely different experience.
