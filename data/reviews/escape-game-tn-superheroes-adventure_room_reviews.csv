Olivia was our game master both times (Super Hero Room and Japanese thriller), and she does such a great job directing us when we needed a hint. She definitely adds to the experience with her bubbly attitude!"

The Japanese Thriller Room and Super Hero room. Even though we weren't successful, we had a great time working with Gill and making new friends for the night. Great concepts."
