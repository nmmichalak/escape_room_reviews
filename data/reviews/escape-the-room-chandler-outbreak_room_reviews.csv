"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Escape The Room Chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-chandler-outbreak,0,"I have done 21 one escape rooms with my fiance! We love them; we came here and played The Theater room, which was fun, and a little challenging. We recently came back to do OutBreak, which we knew was the hardest room, but this room is specifically meant as a money grab room, which I have played a few rooms like this, elsewhere; before! What I mean by that is the room is designed so you don't make it out, and they take your $100 bucks that is costed you to book it! There is a difference between challenging and just making it so hard that you spend the whole time on one set of puzzles starting at screens which hurt your eyes! I thought the concept of the room was awesome but the way the room was laid out, game wise was not good at all! This room in my opinion needs to be reworked; I will not becoming back here again, and I will not be doing another escape room in general, for a long time as this room left me with a very bad, and annoyed feeling, of being taken advantage of money wise! I can no longer recommend this place to anyone that I know or that asks me!"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Escape The Room Chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-chandler-outbreak,1,There were 7 of us and we needed everyone! Wasn't easy at all but with the clues we made it thru! Will definitely be going back to try the other rooms. It is kinda pricey so it would be for another special occasion. The people working there were GREAT!!
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Escape The Room Chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-chandler-outbreak,2,Staff was so beyond sweet & welcoming. Went for part of my fianc√©'s 21st birthday. We did the Outbreak room. It was honestly pretty challenging! Staff said that's their hardest room. We didn't finish the whole room in time but we only had two steps left before we could've won so I think we did pretty well!! Overall we had a great time & we are excited to do the other two rooms soon!! We found a 50% off coupon online so definitely look for coupons or sign up for emails for them to send you coupons every now & then!
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Escape The Room Chandler in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-chandler-outbreak,3,We did a team build event here and it was so much fun. Most of the group had never done one before and we managed to save the world from a virus in the Outbreak room and escaped in about 55 minutes. This is new to the Chandler Mall (right by BJ's Brewery and where Cold Stone Creamery used to be). Super clean and really nice inside. Our host was super nice too. The staff was very friendly. I'm definitely going back with a group of friends.
