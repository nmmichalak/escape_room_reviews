Escape Tactic is by far the best one yet. We did Devils vs. Heels and each puzzle was so thoughtfully put together. The rooms are so well designed that it creates a true experience. The location is an added bonus, with breweries right across the street. I went with friends, and can’t wait to get my team out soon!"
