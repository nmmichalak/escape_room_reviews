"Escape room ""The Hatch"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/Breakout-Waikiki-THE-HATCH,7,"My husband and I did a Breakout tonight and we absolutely loved it - I would highly recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure who likes to figure things out. The mental stimulation and adrenalin from 57 minutes of solving the puzzles left us buzzing for hours afterward (and feeling ecstatic that we had actually broken out!) - we still can't stop talking about it. The staff was super cool and the experience had all kinds of ingenious, clever, and unexpected turns. Would definitely do it again!"
