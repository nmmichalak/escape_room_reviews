"Escape room ""Shipwrecked with St. Paul"" by Bible Treks Christian Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/bible-treks-escape-room-shipwrecked-with-st-paul,0,"We happened to stumble on this escape room by chance only to find out it was meant to be.  Our group has never done an escape room before and it turned out we got put into the hardest one with a 10% success rate.  Collin took about 20 minutes to go through an explanation of the mechanics and set the tone for the room.  The room was masterfully created and our challenges really allowed everyone to participate, each of our individual strengths were allowed to shine in order to get our team through the puzzles.  This is a great team building event.  Collin was an amazing host and we had the best time."

It was an absolute hit! We loved the idea of a christian themed room too. The whole experience was great. The clues and the game were a fun and exciting challenge. I'd highly recommend Bible Treks. Thanks for the memories!

It challenges your thinking skills but doesn’t make you feel like you don’t know enough about the Bible to solve it. It’s very exhilarating!
