"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-amnesia,0,"We had a great time doing both the Amnesia and Resurrection rooms. Our wonderful game master Jasmine was enthusiastic and supportive. This Quest Room location is in the South Bay Galleria, so there is ample parking, lighting, and places to eat nearby.  We have done all the other rooms by this company and these rooms have the amazing build quality, story elements, and immersion of those rooms plus an added live actor element.  The actor provides some creepy and funny moments, and helps move the gameplay and story forward.  The structure and design of the game promotes collaboration. There is hardly a moment where you feel like you are alone solving a random puzzle and then reporting back to your group. The suspense and thrill are maximized when everyone is present when there is a scary reveal or jump scare. I never heard ""What happened?"" or ""What did you see?"" We all experienced the awesomeness together.  For those apprehensive to do these rooms because of the ""horror"" element, you will be ok. These rooms have plenty of humorous and engaging moments that perfectly balance out the fear factor.  So take a deep breath and enjoy!"
"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-amnesia,1,"Wow!! It's so hard to write a review without too many spoilers. But we played Amnesia and it was insanely cool! The way it starts out is super different and makes you think more practical than other escape rooms (I work at one so I LOVE playing others and seeing what works and what doesn't) this one works!! Great staff and AMAZING tech. 10/10 recommend! Our actor Jasmine was great, our game master Matt was also really awesome! I'm hoping to get to see him act in the future. And Katey(Katie?) was one of the nicest bubbliest people I've ever met. Just an overall mind blowing and fun experience. (You May even get some free candy )"
"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-amnesia,2,We had an amazing time! Its a big room. Definitely a must try. They said group of six is the max they can do per game. We did Amnesia and it was funny/ creepy. Our game master was super awesome. I think his name was antoinne. Will definitely be back to try the other room
