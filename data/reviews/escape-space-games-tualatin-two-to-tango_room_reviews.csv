"Escape room ""Two to Tango"" by Escape Space Games in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/escape-space-games-tualatin-two-to-tango,0,After having done Two to Tango we went back to do Cell Block! Not only was it amazingly fun but the same host we had last time was our host again! He was just as enthusiastic and encouragement along the way! Thanks Tyler! Best way to celebrate a birthday for my sister! Canâ€™t wait to go back!
