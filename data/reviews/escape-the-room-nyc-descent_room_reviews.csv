"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-descent,0,We had a great time playing the Submarine. Without to many spoilers -- the part where you have to navigate the Submarine is great! I recommend better lighting and puzzles to be logically connected.
"Escape room ""The Submarine"" by Escape The Room NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-the-room-nyc-descent,1,My friend and I had a fantastic time escaping the Submarine yesterday with a bunch of strangers. We all worked very well together even though we were three separate groups. The different skills sets we brought to the game enabled us to solve multiple clues at the same time and we communicated and collaborated on everything. Can't wait to try the other rooms.

The vibe was brilliant and the game well set up! Would recommend this to anyone going to NYC! Just be prepared to feel frustrated when you find out the answers and that you should've managed to escape!!
