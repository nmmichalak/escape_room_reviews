"Escape room ""Pursuit of Steam"" by Cryptex Escape Rooms in Branson",https://worldofescapes.com/branson/quests/cryptex-escape-rooms-pursuit-of-steam,2,"Our 3rd escape room experience in Branson (3 different places) and we would definitely visit Cryptex again. Convenient and easy to find location and very friendly staff. We did the ""Pursuit of Steam"" room and found it to be challenging, but not impossible. We (husband and myself) escaped with about 5 minutes to spare. Fun time!"
