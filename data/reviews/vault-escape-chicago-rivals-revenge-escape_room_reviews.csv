"Escape room ""Rival’s Revenge Escape"" by Vault Escape in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/vault-escape-chicago-rivals-revenge-escape,0,"I stumbled upon Vault Escape Rooms when my cousin was visiting from out of town and we were looking for something fun to do. This place was close to us and at a reasonable price so we decided to check it out.  Staff is friendly, professional and very helpful. So far we've managed to escape both rooms we've done: Rival's Revenge & The Witch's Spell. Upon arrival we're greeted and given instructions on do's & don'ts, then we get a back story to the room before time starts running. Puzzles are challenging enough to keep you thinking outside the box but not overly hard that you can't crack 'em. If you get stuck you get hints which come in handy. Both times we've had 4 people participate, but I believe VER's allows up to 8 participants in some of the rooms. What we really liked was that when you book a room it's booked privately just for your party. I look forward to checking out the rest of the rooms, but I definitely recommend this place!"
