"Escape room ""The Ritual Room"" by Escapism Portland in Portland",https://worldofescapes.com/portland/quests/Escapism-Portland-TheRitual-Room,1,Our group of six didn't have a clue how to go about solving the puzzles necessary to open the many locks.  We weren't told we could ask for clues and wasted much of the time allotted.  It would have been fun if we had been making decent progress!  The premise is quite brilliant.  I would suggest starting with one of the easy rooms if you've never played the game before.
