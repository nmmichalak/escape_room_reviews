"Escape room ""Pretender"" by Riddle Room in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/riddle-room-pretender,0,"My Daughters and I attended the Bucker and Pretender rooms. It was exciting fun, we all had our assignments and completed both rooms. The Pretender is a tricky room we just completed it in 58 seconds 20 minutes. I didn't think I would enjoy this riddle room concept but I plan to take my husband the next time."
"Escape room ""Pretender"" by Riddle Room in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/riddle-room-pretender,1,"We completed The Pretender and really enjoyed it. This was the first escape room I did with my kids (10 & 12). I was a little nervous that they would feel the puzzles were too challenging, but they ended up doing most of the work themselves!  Great experience, friendly staff and we'll return for another puzzle soon!"
"Escape room ""Pretender"" by Riddle Room in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/riddle-room-pretender,2,I came here with a group of friends and we did The Pretender in two groups of four. We competed against each other for best time and fewest hints. Savannah was great and got into the spirit of our nerdiness with us! Can't wait to try The Bunker. Thanks Riddle Room!
