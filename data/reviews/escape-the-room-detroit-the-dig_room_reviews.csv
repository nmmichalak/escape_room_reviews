"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Detroit in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-the-room-detroit-the-dig,0,"We did The Dig with 8 people. Had a phenomenal time! The puzzles were much more involved and intricate than we had anticipated. I don't want to give anything away so I will just say it was a great time, go with a group of friends, leave no stone unturned, and work fast!"

The room was awesome and I was impressed. Our ""guide"" was great. It was cool how everyone from our group contributed something different to the challenge. We ended up winning with 2 minutes left!! Would highly recommend this to anyone who would be interested in an escape room!"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Detroit in Detroit",https://worldofescapes.com/detroit/quests/escape-the-room-detroit-the-dig,2,Escape the Room Detroit was so much fun! The Dig was a little pricey but worth it! Our group of four got out with 1 minute and 27 seconds to spare. I was entertained the whole time. Our clue master was really nice and explained the directions and asked if we had any questions before and after the event. Will most likely come back again and I definitely recommend this location!
