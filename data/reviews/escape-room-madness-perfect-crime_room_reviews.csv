"Escape room ""The Perfect Crime"" by Escape Room Madness in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-room-madness-perfect-crime,0,"Some of the puzzles were fairly interesting and fun, but there were some concepts that I did not like. Clues are very antisocial with little guidance from the game masters. The last puzzle was also a near impossible one even after having it explained. I wish there was a more personal connection so there could be more guidance with difficult connections."

The game was in a large, well-lit room and had a whodunit theme in which you learned about suspects throughout the game and needed to solve the murder in 60 minutes before the killer killed again.Hopefully we can come back to New York and play the other games someday."
