"Escape room ""Traumatized"" by Legendary Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/legendary-escape-rooms-traumatized,0,"I did the Traumatized room with my boyfriend and three other people. I feel this was a good number of people for this room. The decor and design made you feel very immersed in the story. The room had a good ""scare factor"".We had a person in the room who was not an actor to direct us in case we got off track or so that we would not break anything. I personally feel that takes away from the experience. This room does have a lot of puzzles that went well with the decor and design of the room. Unfortunately, I have done most of them in other escape rooms. The room had some cool props but I felt the puzzles were a bit time consuming and lacking in creativity.I feel this is a great room for newbies."
