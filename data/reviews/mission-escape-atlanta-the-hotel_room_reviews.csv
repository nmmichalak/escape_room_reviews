Didn't fully solve our puzzle, but got really close. These puzzles are a decent level of difficulty without being frustrating. Each solved puzzle experience was satisfying and felt genuinely earned. Bring your own group of friends or share with strangers."

OMG! What an amazing time we had! The staff was incredible and the ""Mission"" top notch. By far one of the best birthdays ever. We had so much fun trying to figure out the puzzles and felt so exhilarated when we escaped the room! I highly recommend this place and will be going back when they open the new room. Can't wait! We also made 2 new friends locked in that room for ALMOST an hour. YES WE DID ESCAPE!"
