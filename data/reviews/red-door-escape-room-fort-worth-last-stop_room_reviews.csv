"Escape room ""Last Stop"" by Red Door Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-fort-worth-last-stop,0,"We did the Last Stop (the 25 min mini-game). Tara was our game master, and she was awesome! This our 10-year-old daughterâ€™s first time doing an escape room, and Tara made her feel a full member of the group. We really enjoyed it, and will definitely come back!"
