"Escape room ""Time Travel. Ex Machine"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/conundrum-ex-machine,0,Great experience that made for a fun night. Ex Machine was a blast from start to finish; the first time I've had an adrenaline rush from solving puzzles!
"Escape room ""Time Travel. Ex Machine"" by Conundroom in Seattle",https://worldofescapes.com/seattle/quests/conundrum-ex-machine,1,Well put together and had an amazing time. Our group of 5 did the Express game and was so impressed with the gameplay we came back the next day to do Ex-Machine. We were a little more intimidated with this one as it was labeled as more difficult but we were able to roll through it and finish. I have done 6 escape games now and I would say Ex-Machine was the most puzzling and challenging but has turned out to be my favorite room thus far. If you are on the fence with coming to this place by all means go to Conundroom you will have a lot of fun.

Ex Machine was immersive with clever themed puzzles. It was a futuristic multi-room adventure. Express was a more standard escape room with a good variety of puzzles, also filling multiple rooms. Would highly recommend and will definitely be coming back for new rooms in the future."

Alex, our guide, was encouraging and his ""You can do that"" in the beginning set our attitude. Young people in my team were great, cracking puzzles one by one. Ex-Machine is a spacious setting, very well done. Thank you very much to organizers of Conundrum room and Alex, we had fun and everybody wants to come back for a different game."

Great setup, awesome story, challenging puzzles and tons of laughs. Well worth the trip and have already started planning to visit the other rooms. Recommend to everyone."
