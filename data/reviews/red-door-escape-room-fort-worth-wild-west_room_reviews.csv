My group of dumb friends and I decided to play Wild West and boy lemme tell ya, it’s fun and there’s puzzles there that has me stump and I like to think I’m a pretty good escapee. We had Zach (Zack? Sorry I didn’t ask him how to spell his name) as a game master and THANK GOD we did. He helped us out so much, had it not been for him our dumb selves wouldn’t have been able to make it out of the first room. The staff there is nice as well. Christian (girl) told me I was beautiful and I can do anything I wanted to before I left and honestly I kinda needed that after seeing how dumb my group is."
