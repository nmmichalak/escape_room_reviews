"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Great-Escape-Room-The-Library,0,"We tried the Game Room recently and had a blast, go with a big group of friends or family, the more the merrier and it definitely helps you to solve the puzzles. Can't wait until they get another room to try. Cant give too many details but it is a lot of fun, go do it."
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Great-Escape-Room-The-Library,1,Our family LOVED this activity - we try to do something different every year and this was so much fun - got us all working together to try to solve the clues. We range in age from 19-53 and every one of us was needed to search for and figure out the clues!

I did not know what we trully signed up for till we got there and we had to find our way out of the locked room by uncovering clues and solving problems. It was GREAT. We will be going again end of month to the other room. I wish they had more than two rooms as Id like to keep doing this. It helps you use your brain and really assess situations. A lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Sherlock Holmes’ Library"" by The Great Escape Room in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/The-Great-Escape-Room-The-Library,3,We had a great time. Will definitely be back!!! The hosts were wonderful. The level of difficulty was just right.

If you're in Grand Rapids and have an hour, this is a must do. It is a very fun and unique experience!!! We went with a group of 5 girls on a girls trip and we were the only people in the room. We came very close to escaping but did not end up making it."

Was not disappointed!!! We were able to escape, but with only 1:30 left so there was some pressure at the end. Some highly educated individuals in this party and they were challenged for the clues. FUN and CHALLENGING but not so difficult that it couldn't be solved by just using some common sense. Would definitely go back as they indicated that the rooms will change regularly."
