"Escape room ""The Toy Room"" by Escape Thrill in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-thrill-the-toy-room,0,"Came to the escape thrill while on a recent vacation to Clearwater Beach. Found it on Groupon or another coupon site. We were in the toy room, which I thought would be too easy, but it was not. The staff was very friendly and was willing to help when we got stuck on a couple of issues. I feel like the price was reasonable by buying the coupon, but not sure I would want to pay full price."

The Toy Room was perfect for us (2 adults, a teenager, and a 10, 7, and 5 year old). We had a blast and all of us worked together, even the youngest was able to contribute, yet the room was challenging enough to keep us busy the entire time. We beat it with a couple minutes to spare. It was great to watch everyone get excited and help each other solve the puzzles. So fun!"
