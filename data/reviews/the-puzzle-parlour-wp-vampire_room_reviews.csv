"Escape room ""Vampire"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-wp-vampire,1,My friends and I had such a fun time! The eight of us did the Vampire room and escaped in 43 minutes. Ken was so helpful and gave us hints when we were stuck. He took the time to answer our questions afterward as well. Already planning our next trip back to do the other rooms!
"Escape room ""Vampire"" by The Puzzle Parlour in White Plains",https://worldofescapes.com/white-plains/quests/the-puzzle-parlour-wp-vampire,2,I went today for the first time with my kids and some of their friends. We did the Vampire room and we all had fun working out the puzzles together. They were challenging but enjoyable to figure out. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for something different to do with friends and family.
