"Escape room ""Sara's Got a Secret"" by Try-N-Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/try-n-escape-saras-got-a-secret,0,I highly recommend this activity for your next group event. Have done the Western Room and Sarah's got a Secret room. Both were challenging and fun.

This escape room was AMAZING. When we arrived, we were welcomed by one of the owners who was amazing and so, so friendly. He took the time to talk to me for a good 15 minutes after we escaped and I have tons of respect for an owner that will stop and talk to their customers. If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I really would. Highly, HIGHLY recommended. I did the ""Sarah's got a secret"" room with a friend and was blown away by how well put together and thrilling it was. I have been to numerous other escape businesses in the past all over South Florida and very few can even compare to the room I did here. If you are seeking an extraordinary, adrenaline filled, and unique bonding experience that is not just your run of the mill outing then you really need to get over there to 'Try N Escape'!!!"

I'm disappointed to have to go to any other places knowing that this is my new standard. The rooms are designed down to the T. Everything makes sense while still being super challenging and surprising. The owner is the funniest and nicest guy ever. We were so pumped by last night's Sara's Got a Secret (which the description, though amazing, STILL doesn't do the room justice) that we're booking the other room tonight. The owner knows what he's doing and has been to enough escape rooms that he explained ""this isn't like other escape rooms"" before shutting the door on us. Beyond incredible. I would recommend Sara's Got a Secret to anyone who can handle some creepy plot lines, some scares (nothing too bad but be on guard), and a real challenge with my group's time to beat!"
