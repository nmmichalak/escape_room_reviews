"Escape room ""Safe House"" by Think Solve Escape in Glassboro",https://worldofescapes.com/glassboro/quests/think-solve-escape-safe-house,0,"This was a first time experience for my wife and me. We did it as a couple and had a WONDERFUL experience. The staff was friendly. The room, The Safe House, was well laid out. The puzzles made you think. We did need to ask for clues, which were helpful but did not blatantly give the answer. We were able to solve and escape with five minutes to spare."

I haven't had that much fun or laughed so hard in a long time!! We absolutely enjoyed it. Very cleverly set up. Can't wait to come again for another room adventure!
