Alcatraz was my third room and a new favorite. Loved the theme and the little twist of this room. The owners here are awesome - accommodating, pleasant and I'm pretty sure they have as much fun as the players do! They really know how to put together an escape room as all 3 are excellent. I can not wait for the next to open. I would recommend Alcatraz in a heartbeat! Thanks for another great experience!"
