The puzzles were great and the staff was very helpful. Our game-master Matthew did a top notch job. You could tell that he was truly passionate about his job and made the experience 100x better. We managed to escape with two minutes to spare. 10/10 would go again. If you go be sure to ask for Matthew, you wont regret it."

I would for sure go back. The 1930's Capone theme was very original and truly felt like we were in that time. There was also a large rush of adrenaline under the stress of a timed puzzle. Overall it was an exciting time with many twists, turns, and good friends."
