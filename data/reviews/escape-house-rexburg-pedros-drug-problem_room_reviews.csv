"Escape room ""The Locker Room - Pedro's Drug Problem"" by Escape House in Rexburg",https://worldofescapes.com/rexburg/quests/escape-house-rexburg-pedros-drug-problem,0,"We had a large family gathering and booked two rooms. The kids went up against the adults to see who could escape first. The adults did Pedro's Cartel, in the Locker room. The kids did Eddie's Organs in the other room. Both rooms were really fun, and we all had a great time! Adults won!"
