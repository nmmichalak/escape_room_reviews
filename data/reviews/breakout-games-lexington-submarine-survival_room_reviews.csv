"Escape room ""Submarine Survival"" by Breakout Games - Lexington in Lexington",https://worldofescapes.com/lexington/quests/breakout-games-lexington-submarine-survival,0,I won the free tester game for submarine survival and had an absolute blast! It’s so fun and creative; unique. Another good thing is it’s very family oriented! Me and my group made it out (barely) and we were all laughing and cheering when we made it out!! Can’t wait to do more new rooms👍 definitely recommend this room when it opens
