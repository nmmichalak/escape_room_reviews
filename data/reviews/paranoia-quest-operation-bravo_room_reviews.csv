"Escape room ""Operation BRAVO"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-operation-bravo,2,"After a disastrous experience in another escape room in the area.. Big Escape Rooms, to be exact, we were somewhat nervous going in to this one. We had great experiences in other escape rooms, but that one previous room was such a disappointment, we didn't know how this one would turn out.We did the Operation Bravo room. There was a minor issue with a monitor, so our room monitor came in, took care of it, and added time back to account for the issue. The entire rest of the room worked perfectly and we were able to escape with room to spare.When you have a team taking care to ensure a positive customer experience, you get five stars out of me."
