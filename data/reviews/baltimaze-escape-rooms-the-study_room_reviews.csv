"Escape room ""The Study"" by Baltimaze Escape Rooms in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/baltimaze-escape-rooms-the-study,0,"I took my teenage sister to Baltimaze and we did ""The Study"" room. I've been to one other escape room before. This place looked very professional on the inside and the staff is nice and helpful. We signed waivers and started the game right away. We both had a ton of fun! The game was interesting and entertaining but (with helpful hints) not impossible to solve. I'm planning on returning to Baltimaze with my work friends sometime soon. I would definitely recommend this place!"
