"Escape room ""Forgotten Pharaoh Escape"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-forgotten-pharaoh-escape,0,We had an excellent time here for my daughter's 12th birthday. The Egyptian adventure room was perfect for their age and ability and they had a blast.
"Escape room ""Forgotten Pharaoh Escape"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-forgotten-pharaoh-escape,1,I took my and daughter and her friend for escape room fun for her birthday. We both have experienced other escape rooms. This trip was a first experience for her friend.  The staff was very friendly. We tried The Pharaoh's Tomb. We had so much fun that we returned the next day to experience more; Defenders of the Galaxy. We are also looking forward to the next adventure being added later this year and can't wait to come back and try out our skills. ;) Highly recommend this adventure!
"Escape room ""Forgotten Pharaoh Escape"" by Xscape Pods in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/xscape-pods-forgotten-pharaoh-escape,2,This is my first time in an Escape Room and it was SO MUCH FUN! You can tell just from entering the lobby area that there is so much attention to detail and design and it's shown in the rooms as well. We did the Pharoah room. It really felt like an immersive experience. I enjoyed all the puzzles and how they each required different types of thinking with which to solve them. We got out with 4 minutes left (mostly because of my team - I was not as clever) and I definitely want to come back with a bigger team to try out the other rooms!
