"Escape room ""The Composer"" by Escape Chambers in Des Moines",https://worldofescapes.com/des-moines/quests/escape-chambers-the-composer,0,"We did the Composer room this past Saturday night and overall our group had a fun time! This is the second time that I have been to this location and now that I've done two rooms I feel like I can give a review. I think recommending less people (our party had seven) would be a good idea. This room is smaller in space so there's just not enough for seven people to participate effectively. Also, there were couple activities/puzzles in this specific room that we had to do the same thing a couple times bc they ""stick"" or malfunction."

We had enough people to break out for the Recruit and the Composer. Both groups were pleased with the story-line, clues, and hints."

We completed using all three hints and escaped with five minutes left on the clock."
