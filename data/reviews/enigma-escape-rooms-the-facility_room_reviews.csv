"Escape room ""The Facility"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-facility,0,"Decided, last minute, to do an escape room. We had previously completed the first room, The Missing Scientist, and wanted to solve The Facility. We had a BLAST! There was only 3 of us but we still escaped successfully. We really like the puzzles at Enigma even if a couple of them had us stumped for longer than we would have liked.The website was easy to navigate and we had no problem buying our tickets and signing the waivers online.The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. We are looking forward to the third room they are working to complete. I hear it will be quite the challenge but we are always up for a fun challenge!"

The puzzles were incredibly clever and well thought out, and the twists and turns and ""aha!"" moments were so satisfying. The production value is top-notch. You have to experience this for yourself! Do it!"
"Escape room ""The Facility"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/enigma-escape-rooms-the-facility,2,I wanted to do something fun with a group of friends for my birthday! We invited our closest friends and had so much fun!!! We came very close but were unable to escape. Our group spent the rest of the evening talking about doing it again somewhere and how much fun we had! I would recommend this for anyone!
