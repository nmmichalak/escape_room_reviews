"Escape room ""Santa's Naughty List"" by The Greatest Escape Games in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/the-greatest-escape-games-santas-naughty-list,0,"We had a lot of fun for my daughter's 11th birthday party in the Santa Claus room. The facility was very accommodating, allowing us to use a room afterward for cake and presents. Only bummer was that we figured out the code to get out about 5 seconds after they opened the door. Next time, we'll try a different room and escape!"
