"Escape room ""The Ninja Protocol"" by Break Through Sac in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/break-through-sac-the-ninja-protocol,0,"The ninja protocol room was a lot of fun, with some interesting surprises built into the room. My group and I got out just in the nick of time! I liked that they tried to be unique from a lot of other game rooms that already exist and added in some modern techy stuff. Cant wait to come back to try their other room!"
"Escape room ""The Ninja Protocol"" by Break Through Sac in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/break-through-sac-the-ninja-protocol,1,My first ever escape room didn't escape but had a fun time. I was challenged for the most part and would recommend having as many people as you can. Highly recommend the room ninja protocol if you want a challenge.
