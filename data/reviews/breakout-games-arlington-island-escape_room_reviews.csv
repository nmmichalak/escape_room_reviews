"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Arlington in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/breakout-games-arlington-island-escape,0,"Of the three rooms I completed with this company, this was my least favorite.  It didn't feel as real (I would fill the room with sand).  And a few of the puzzles weren't put together well.  One of them was even incorrect when I participated and they had to inform us of the correct answer because of a mess up.  With that in mind, I went back to the company and enjoyed other rooms more."

Well, that night was this past Thursday. We were paired with 3 other young ladies and we were taken back to our event room(Island Escape) shortly after we arrived. After the brief explanation from the game master, we were off on our adventure.We got stuck a few times but after couple of gentle nudging hints from the game master we managed to work our way through the challenge. We all worked well together and all had a great time. We definitely didn't set any time record but, to be honest, running down to the final few minutes before 'getting out' seemed to heighten our experience even more. Thanks for a great time as apparently all of my girls had so much of a great time that I was informed that ""we need to do them all!"""

Not to say there wasn't some thinking, but mostly things were quite intuitive.Fun:Just wow - so many surprises to keep your eyes open for. This really got my adrenaline pumping a few times."
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Arlington in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/breakout-games-arlington-island-escape,3,"While visiting from Phoenix, I did the Island Escape with my sister. I am not quite sure how to describe our experience. The room seemed a little out of date to us, but that isn't necessarily a negative to us. But the clues were a little out there at times. There was one clue that required us to use binoculars, which since we are both over 60 and wear bifocals, we couldn't see anything thru them. Our gamemaster said we could use the ""zoom"" function on our phones instead. Well, I did say we were over 60, and we had no idea what the zoom function is, and we sure didn't want to waste precious minutes trying to find out. Also, colors were hard to differentiate between, which wasted time. And there was one lock that was so wedged between the puzzle and the wall, that it was hard to turn. Not exactly an ""even"" flowing game for us. We did 6 escape rooms at multiple locations on this visit, and this was our least favorite. My rating of this experience went from ""poor"" to ""average"" because the asst manager, Hannah, saved the day for us by being so pro-active and super nice at the end."
