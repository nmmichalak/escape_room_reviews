Once with my wife, brother-in-law, and sister. We made it through the diamond one. And then my wife and I went through the bomb for my birthday today as they sent us a coupon for a free game for me. We made it out. The rooms are very fun and clever. Super well thought out. Especially the diamond heist. I love going to this place. The game host Cody is very personable and makes the game enjoyable. I would highly recommend this place especially if you have a coupon or groupon."

Decided to check this one out with four other people and we were lucky enough to have a whole room to ourselves. We did the Diamond Heist and wow it was phenomenal! We got out in 47 minutes and (what seemed to be the owner and his wife) were both so friendly and great! Absolutely recommend and cannot wait to go back to check out their other rooms!"
