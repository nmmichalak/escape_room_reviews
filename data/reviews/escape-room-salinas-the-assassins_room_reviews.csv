"Escape room ""The Assassins"" by Escape Room Salinas in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-salinas-the-assassins,0,Such a fun/different activity to do on a date night or with a big group! Definitely coming back here again. The staff were very friendly and helpful!
"Escape room ""The Assassins"" by Escape Room Salinas in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-salinas-the-assassins,1,We just had our first experience in an escape room today. We had a party of seven and did the Assassins room and it was a lot of fun. We didn't get through it in time but we still had a great time. The staff is very helpful and informative. We would go back and try some different rooms it makes for a fun family hour. Put on your thinking caps :)
"Escape room ""The Assassins"" by Escape Room Salinas in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-salinas-the-assassins,2,"Was here this Saturday for a work team building exercise.  This was my first time doing an ""escape room"" event. There was no wait and it was not busy, but then again we made an appointment for 11am.  They have a large waiting area and water bottles for sale for a dollar. We were a group of 10 but we were broken up into two groups of 5.  My group did the Assassin themed escape room and we had an hour to escape.  I have to say it was fun albeit the puzzles were challenging (so many locks!).  The room we were in was nicely decorated to the theme, and it had a nice ""creepy"" ambiance to it to set the mood.  I don't want to say too much and give it away, but overall it was nicely done. The owner is nice, and she also provides up to three hints if you get stuck.  The only downside is that they have a small parking lot.  I recommend carpooling especially if you are a big group like mine.I definitely recommend this place if you love solving puzzles with friends/family and/or as a team building exercise.  We definitely learned teamwork and how to quickly share ideas to get the task done.  It is too bad that I am not close by to Salinas because I would like to come back here again to do the other themes."
