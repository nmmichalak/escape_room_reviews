"Escape room ""Outlawed"" by The Escape Company in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-room-entertainment-outlawed,0,"Played 'Outlawed' last night with my boyfriend! LOVED the game it was so fun! The puzzles were tricky but really fun and it was so exciting when you solved them. We had 4 hints we could use during the game, the only frustrating thing about the experience was sometimes the hints were very helpful but then sometimes the hint just told us what we were already doing. Maybe work on better hints but overall it was great! We escaped with a minute left! Last thing, we were placed with a group without knowing. The group was supposed to do an earlier room but missed their time so ended up going in with us. It would've been nice to be asked if that was okay or even just a heads up. Especially when a couple from the group vigorously made out the entire time and were in our way when trying to escape the room. It was uncomfortable and the management watching from the camera didn't even say anything when they visibly saw we were uncomfortable. I know thats a hard situation i just wish it could've been handled somewhat better. Anyways will definitely be back! Loved the game overall!!!!!"

We had never played and decided it would be a fun way to celebrate my sons 18th birthday with his friends. We did the outlawed room. What fun. We didn't escape but we were only 2 clues away. We will definitely be doing another room in the future.

I'm so glad we did! Matt was awesome and the Outlawed room definitely keeps your wheels turning! Can't wait to go back and try out the other rooms!!!
