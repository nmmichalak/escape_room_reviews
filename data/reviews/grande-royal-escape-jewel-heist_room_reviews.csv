"Escape room ""Night Train 1892 - Jewel Heist"" by Grande Royal Escape in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/grande-royal-escape-jewel-heist,0,"We did the Train Heist room and it was really fun, but the doors and locks didn't work that great. The concept is awesome as I've completed over 40 rooms across the country, but the lack of making sure the codes were correct was bad. We had to work on ""other stuff"" while a staff member had to fix a code on one item which is highly discouraging and distracting. I still believe the room was unique and fun though. If you're in town, it's definitely worth trying this room."
"Escape room ""Night Train 1892 - Jewel Heist"" by Grande Royal Escape in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/grande-royal-escape-jewel-heist,1,My group of six truly enjoyed the Jewel Heist experience this past weekend! We all felt like little detectives and I saw the spark in my friends' eyes brighten when they solved one of the riddles. It would be a great activity for families in town visiting during the holidays!! I am looking forward to bringing my dad to this location to experience the thrill of Grand Royal Escape.
