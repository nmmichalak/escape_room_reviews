"Escape room ""Chopper Down"" by Lockbusters Escape Game in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/lockbusters-escape-game-chopper-down,0,"I had always wanted to do an escape room for some time now. There were 7 of us and we did the ""Chopper Down"" room. It was soooo much fun - kinda like being inside a video game. There were so many puzzles, everyone got to participate. It truly does take team work to finish in time, and many of the puzzles were challenging. The staff was super friendly, and had great senses of humor. I definitely want to come back and try the other rooms. Highly recommended!!"
