"Escape room ""Motel"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-motel,6,"The idea of coming here at first was exciting, but the actual experience is much greater than what you could anticipate. The staff was really friendly and interactive with us, not only were they nice, but they are quick in resetting the rooms so that others may enjoy the thrill of escaping as well. This combination allowed for my group to decide that we will be trying to solve all other that are available and further encourage anyone to come and try your luck in defeating these puzzles."
