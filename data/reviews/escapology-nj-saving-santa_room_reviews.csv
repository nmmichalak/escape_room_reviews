"Escape room ""Saving Santa"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-saving-santa,0,"We visited Escapology yesterday for my Birthday. My family highly recommends both the particular game we played (Saving Santa) and the location in general. This was our first time there - the staff was so friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The game was well run and they gave us bottles of water and wristbands when we accomplished our goal and Saved Santa. The waiting area was clean and beautifully decorated. We will visit again!"

Beautiful place with such an inviting atmosphere immediately when you walk in.  Staff was so nice and friendly.  Michael and John (who is a long time Fanwoodian) welcomed us immediately.  We had a blast with the kids and we ""Saved Santa"" with 12 minutes to spare!  So much fun! Highly recommend checking it out.  Thanks for a great night out with the kids!"
"Escape room ""Saving Santa"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-saving-santa,2,This was a super fun experience! Perfect for group activities or even date night! We did the Santa escape room and it was really fun and challenging! When we arrived for our game time slot 15 minutes early we still had to wait about 15 minutes but overall it was a great 1 hour mind puzzle! Highly recommend !
