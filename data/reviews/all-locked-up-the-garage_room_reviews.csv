"Escape room ""The Garage"" by All Locked Up in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/all-locked-up-the-garage,0,"A group of friends and I tried the Garage and we left thoroughly satisfied with our experience. We weren't expecting to find such a gem in such a quiet location especially considering there isn't much to do in Canyon Country, but we couldn't have had more fun. We will definitely be coming back to try out the other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Garage"" by All Locked Up in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/all-locked-up-the-garage,1,My daughter has been telling me she wanted to go to an escape room for the last few months. I finally booked our first experience at All Locked Up. We made it a family night and had a terrific game in The Garage. We will definitely be back. Thank you so much for the fun evening.

They built a legit Garage complete with a regulation garage door, all inside their facility.  There were some surprises I did not expect at all, and I don't want to give anything away, but it was a blast collaborating with my family and friends.  I totally want to do it again, so I can't wait for them to build out their others rooms.  They had lockers to stash your stuff and they provide a keyed lock that you keep on your possession so you know your stuff is safe.It was nice to have something like this in Canyon Country.  Shout out to Betitos next door if you love Mexican food."
