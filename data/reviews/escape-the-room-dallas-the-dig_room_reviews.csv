"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-the-dig,0,Did The Dig. Got out with 4 minutes to spare...with just me and one other but it was too difficult. Didnt feel like anything was really linked together. Didn't like it. Look of the room was good though...

Staff was so friendly and fun. The room was very cool and I we figured it out just in time! I can't wait to go back and try the other rooms. We did The Dig, and I would highly recommend it!!"
"Escape room ""The Dig"" by Escape the Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/escape-the-room-dallas-the-dig,2,My group had such a great time on yesterday. We did the Dig Room... It was SO much fun! This was my first escape room and it really set the bar high for any others. The decorations felt like I was on a set for some Hollywood movie.

I've done a few other escape rooms and while The Dig was not the hardest, it was by far the most entertaining! The atmosphere was great and the props blew my mind. The staff was helpful, friendly and ran a perfect game. We're already planning another night out at Escape the Room."

We had a great time and although it was confusing at first, we succeeded in solving the room and escaped with under 4 minutes left on the clock! We had a blast and can't wait to return to try out another room."
