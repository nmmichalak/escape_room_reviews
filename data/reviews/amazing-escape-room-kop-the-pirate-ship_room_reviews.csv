It was very challenging and took our combined talents to solve. Our challenge master, Charles was super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it."

Cannot wait to do this again! We had a great time. We liked how we had to solve the puzzle to get to a different room. I would have liked if there were more rooms. Also smaller groups would be better so everyone can feel as if they got a chance to solve. We had some people that solved the puzzles really quickly without input from the others therefore we missed a few puzzles.
