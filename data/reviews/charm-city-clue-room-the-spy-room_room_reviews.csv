"Escape room ""The Spy Room"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-the-spy-room,0,"Challenging. Fun. Worth it.First escape room I have ever done. My group did the spy room, and you definitely come to know your people better.The entire feel of the building is great, with the old style stair railing, red brick, and dark colors. The only thing I can think to make this part better would be theme apparel for the staff. And the staff was good too... friendly and attentive.Anybody looking for a good team-building activity should consider coming here."

Our group of five opted for the Spy room and I was very impressed by the creativity and cleverness of the clues - not to mention we made it out of the room with 3 minutes left. It was entertaining to say the least. Cost per person is $29 but the experience was well worth it. The staff member we worked with was polite and helpful. Charm City Clue Room is perfect for a group outing, and I will definitely be back to escape from the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Spy Room"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-the-spy-room,2,The Spy room was a really fun experience! This is one of many escape rooms I've done and it definitely had some special things in it others did not. We had a group of 3 and we're able to work through the puzzles with almost 15 minutes to spare. Definitely recommended.
"Escape room ""The Spy Room"" by Charm City Clue Room in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/charm-city-clue-room-the-spy-room,3,We were just a couple of escape room addicts at a conference in Baltimore and decided to swing by the Spy room. It was truly a fun experience! My friend and I had three total strangers join us... I was a bit worried as I had only done these with friends before but it was a blast. The clues were fantastic and not just the same as all others. Hifhly recommend this!
