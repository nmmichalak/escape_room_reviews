"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-budapest-express,0,"So much fun! I've done another escape room when I was out of town, so I roughly knew what to expect. We did the Budapest Express, and it was so much fun! This was a birthday outing (for 3 people in my group of 7). Just 2 of us had done one before, so it was a new experience for most of us. Josh led us into the room, explained the rules, and met us at the end as well. He was so nice! Brett, the 'man behind the curtain' was great, and I'm sure enjoyed our anxious attempts at the puzzles! Haha. We all had a great time and plan to return soon!"
"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Garwood in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escapology-nj-budapest-express,1,My husband and I went this afternoon and played the Budapest Express room. We had a blast!! The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the entire process. I love that we could play by ourselves and didn't have to share the room with other couples since we were a small group as it was. I would definitely come again and bring more friends next time.

You are able to make a reservation online very easily, you just have to put a credit card down for at least two spots to reserve the room. I booked a room for late Saturday afternoon the night before. A group of six of us did the Budapest Express. Our game was an hour, and you get three clues throughout the game to help us. It was actually a very hard game! However, we made it out and got our victory picture snapped (it was also then emailed to me). I enjoyed it as a new/different experience."
