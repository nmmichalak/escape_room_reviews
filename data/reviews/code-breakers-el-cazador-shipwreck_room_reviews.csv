"Escape room ""El Cazador Shipwreck"" by Code Breakers Escape and Puzzle Rooms in Saginaw",https://worldofescapes.com/bay-city/quests/code-breakers-el-cazador-shipwreck,0,"The shipwreck game was a great escape room because the owners built it on their own and came up with multiple surprises and interesting puzzles!  There was a bit more reading than I would have cared for, and the immersion was broken each time a clue was asked for because the employees would walk into the game with us.  This room, however, is higher on my list than other games I have played."

We did the Cazadores room with four adults in our 40s, five kids ranging from 12-18 and my mother in her 70s. All of us had a great time! We'd done other escape rooms and this was one of the best. We were blown away to learn the owners had personally designed and built it all themselves. We look forward to coming back again!"

The staff was very kind and helpful. I will for sure be doing the other one!
