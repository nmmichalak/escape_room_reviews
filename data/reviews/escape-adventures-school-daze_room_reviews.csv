We will definitely be back to do all the other rooms and will be sure to recommend your business to all our friends and family. Thank you for an awesome adventure."
"Escape room ""Edge of Space: Discover the Truth!"" by Escape Adventures in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/escape-adventures-school-daze,1,I have visited many escape rooms and this one definitely ranks up with my favorites. My husband and I enjoyed the School Daze room today and we both genuinely had fun. The owner was fantastic and you can tell how much he loves his job! The room was well thought out and challenging yet was realistic in expectations for its players. I cannot wait to return and try the other rooms.

My wife and I took our son and two of his friends and tried to escape out of the ""School Detention"" room. We didn't succeed in the allotted time frame, but we had such a great time trying! The owners/staff were so nice and friendly and were more than willing to give us hints without giving away any answers. I can't wait to go back again and try some other rooms! I definitely recommend giving Escape Adventures a shot!"
