"Escape room ""Investigation of a Miss Treedeath"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-mke-investigation-of-a-miss-treedeath,0,"My friends and I had a blast scrabbling around Miss Treedeath's apartment to discover her next victim! I went originally for a school event and went back a couple days later with my friends! The puzzles were clever, but solvable and we even succeeded in escaping with minutes to spare! Our host Sherrick was great at providing personalized hints when needed. It was a great experience and I hope to go back and try my hand at the rest of the rooms!"
"Escape room ""Investigation of a Miss Treedeath"" by Escape MKE in Milwaukee",https://worldofescapes.com/milwaukee/quests/escape-mke-investigation-of-a-miss-treedeath,1,Visited Escape MKE for the first time on Thursday and loved it so much I came back on Saturday to try a different mission. On this visit we took on Mission MissTree death. It is a super fun and challenging experience with lots of fun puzzles to solve. The staff is great and hilarious. I really enjoyed our MC Sherrick who provided us with clues when we got stuck. Overall a great time that I would recommend to anyone you enjoys puzzles.

The experience was fantastic. Everyone had a great time, even when we found out I missed something. Overall I highly suggest a visit to Escape MKE. My roommates had done the Dr. K one previously and also enjoyed it. Our host, Sherrick, was also a blast. The hints were personalized which made the experience super enjoyable (Jackie's onto something). Everything was really fun. For those worried about the aspect of being locked in the room, it really does not phase you. I plan on coming back in the future."
