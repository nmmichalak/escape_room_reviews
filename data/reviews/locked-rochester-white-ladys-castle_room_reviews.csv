"Escape room ""White Lady's Castle"" by Locked A Rochester Escape Room in Rochester (NY)",https://worldofescapes.com/rochester/quests/locked-rochester-white-ladys-castle,0,Wife and I did the White Ladyâ€™s Castle room by ourselves. Probably the tenth room or so we did from about five different companies. By far the best customer service in any of the rooms we have been to. Thanks Andy for talking us into the more challenging room!
