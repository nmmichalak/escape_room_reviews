"Escape room "" Matter of the Mad Hatter"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-alices-whimsical-wonderland,1,The Clue Room on Havana was awesome! It's family owned and operated and it was obvious they wanted you to have a good time. We did the Alice in Wonderland room and were paired with a family of 6 which were very pleasant and fun to play with. The pricing was fair and the clues were challenging. The experience was great. I'll definitely be coming back!

Went with 6 friends, maybe a bit too much for this room, but still had fun. Completed the WonderLand room with 3 min to spare... Cant wait to try the next level up room another time."
