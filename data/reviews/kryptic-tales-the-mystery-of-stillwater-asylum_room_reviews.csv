"Escape room ""The Mystery of Stillwater Asylum"" by Kryptic Tales in Irvine",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/kryptic-tales-the-mystery-of-stillwater-asylum,0,My friends and I had an amazing experience here!  The Stillwater Asylum was challenging and most importantly very fun! There were a lot of different components to this room and many different clues which made it interesting and also exciting! The room was clever and very well done. Our host Adam was awesome!! He was detailed in his introduction and very knowledgeable about every aspect of the room. I highly recommend Kryptic Tales!

I came with a group of 5, some with more escape room experience and some with none, and we made it out in the nick of time with only two hints. I highly recommend it. Like others are saying, the puzzles were unique and the clues were given in interesting ways. Just the right amount of difficulty for me, and the overall setup was very good for the experience."

Was fun. Can't wait to try there other one. Guy that GM'd was super nice.Would recommend. Not as hard as some of the rooms We've tried but it was super fun. I would say it's not as ""scary"" as I anticipated but it was very good."
