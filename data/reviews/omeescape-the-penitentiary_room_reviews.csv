"Escape room ""The Penitentiary"" by OMEscape in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/omeescape-the-penitentiary,2,"This is a very fun, challenging activity.  The staff was very friendly and involved from answering phone calls to explaining and monitoring the game.  We had a group of 13 teenagers in The Penitentiary and while they didn't escape they had a good time.  Puzzles are challenging but not impossible plus they monitor and provide clues if asked.  Also the effects like smoke, lasers etc are fun.  Highly recommend."

We have been to a couple of other places and this is the best designed. They have very cool rooms and game themes, all puzzles are very thought out and logic. We and our friends really enjoyed the Penitentiary and Lab, we will be back for Room X! Staff was super friendly too!!"

We decided to do the penitentiary, because we loved the storyline and the fact that it is the most challenging room there (only a 10% success rate). We didn't escape in time, but it was seriously amazing!!! The space and puzzles are extremely elaborate and kept us engaged! Huang and Cindy the best! Very friendly and accommodating! I will return with more friends to try and conquer the other two escape rooms!"
