"Escape room ""Chapter Three: The Morgue"" by Evil Genius Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/evil-genius-escape-rooms-the-morgue,0,"Wow, these guys did it again! We came back to see the Evil Genius once again but this time we faced his challenges in their new room The Morgue. From the start, I knew this was a gonna be a good time. The room is such a new concept that it was truly a breath of fresh air! I am a big scaredy cat but this room is not supposed to scare you but it does get the adrenaline pumping. Take a chance and try their bonus room, you will be SO GLAD you did. So gooooood:)"
"Escape room ""Chapter Three: The Morgue"" by Evil Genius Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/evil-genius-escape-rooms-the-morgue,1,Came here to do Chapter 3: The Morgue and we were very impressed.I have always heard great things about Evil Genius but never got around to trying them. Well we finally got around to it and are so glad we did. The Morgue Room had great elements of tech and involved puzzles that we had never seen before! The theme of the room was consistent through out and the decor was high quality and visually appealing. We were kept on our toes the whole time and enjoyed all the puzzles. Customer service was great as well and we look forward to coming back and trying their first 2 chapters!
