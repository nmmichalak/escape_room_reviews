"Escape room ""The Medieval Library"" by Enter the Room in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/Enter-the-Room-The-Medieval-Library,0,"Midevil Library was fun. A little tough for us, but we made it out with 3 seconds to spare. I think we were overthinking a few puzzles. Great to see that the 2 new owners are trying their best to turn things around and make the place a good game. We will be back to try 999 Strange Place."
