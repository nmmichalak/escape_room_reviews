I loved the Casino Takeover room. It truly represents old Vegas and the mobster days! We had a big group so we were able to compete against each other in similar rooms split with a window. The room was tough, but the experience was so unique that it was totally worth it!I have recommended this place to all of my friends and will definitely be back!"
