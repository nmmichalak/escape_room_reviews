"Escape room ""Studio Wonderland"" by Escape It Houston in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/escape-it-houston-studio-wonderland,0,Room was incredibly well made. Loved the puzzles. It was a bit warm and the game master spoke way too quickly. But over all it was a great experience and would love to be back again.

The props included a lighted dance floor, turn tables, and bottles.  It was neat when we unlocked a certain clue the entire dance floor and lights come to life, and music started playing.  Some of our group dressed up in our club clothes to play this one.   A lot of fun, recommend!"
