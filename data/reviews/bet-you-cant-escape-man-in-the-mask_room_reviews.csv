"Escape room ""Man in the Mask"" by Bet You Can't Escape in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/bet-you-cant-escape-man-in-the-mask,0,"My husband and I have done a lot of escape rooms and ""Bet You Can't Escape"" ranks near the top of the list. We completed the ""Man in the Mask"" room and fully enjoyed our experience. The clues flowed smoothly and never left us grasping at straws. The gentlemen who own the place are very dedicated to their business and also heavily involved in their community. We plan to be back for both the rooms, and to support what seems like a great group of people. Thank you!"

Was super fun. All the staff are super nice, attentive, and helpful. Never had a place give us extra couple minutes because we were one step away from escaping. Will definitely be back when we can gather enough people for the Arcade."
