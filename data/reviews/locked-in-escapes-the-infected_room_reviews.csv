"Escape room ""The Infected"" by Locked In Escapes in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/locked-in-escapes-the-infected,0,My friends and I did their new infected room and it was awesome! We had 6 people in our group. The rooms were so unique and well put together and had enough space that we didn't feel too crowded.  I definitely like this place better than a few others I've tried in the springs!The owners are so nice and were doing everything to make our experience fun and awesome!!! We are definitely coming back for our next outing! Highly recommend.
