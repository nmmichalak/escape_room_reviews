"Escape room ""You Be the Judge"" by Conquer the Chamber in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/conquer-the-chamber-you-be-the-judge,0,"My family decided last minute to try an escape room, luckily, Conquer the Chamber had a room open that night. We played ""You be the judge"" and it was awesome! We had six adults and every one of us loved it! All of us were first timers and now can't wait to do it again. Loved it!"
