"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Lakeland Escape Room in Lakeland",https://worldofescapes.com/lakeland/quests/lakeland-escape-room-asylum,0,This was my first ever escape room and I absolutely loved it! The two of us took on the Asylum and had a blast deciphering the clues before successfully escaping with time to spare. Will most certainly be back again with more people in tow! Thanks for a great day!

They worked together, got a little freaked out and a few were too scared to finish it. We finished with less than a minute left in the Asylum and they had a blast solving it! Unforgettable!"

The owners were so friendly. We did the Asylum room and it was just creepy and challenging enough to keep us all on our toes. This was my second time and I plan to go again to try to escape the “Split” room next time!

The staff is friendly and informative, and we met Luna (she's adorable)! We'll definitely be back to try the other rooms."

The Asylum was challenging but we managed to escape with less than a minute left, it was intense. A great place to go for a night out with friends or the family! We will be back!"
