"Escape room ""Secrets of the Master"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-secrets-of-the-master,0,"Me and 4 of my friends came and played the escape room, ""the secrets of the master"" and literally had the time of our lives. The room was put together super well and was clean. It was simple to figure out and the hint system is great. 3 hints or less gets you on leader board which is awesome because some places take time away from you for hints. The game was simple to understand but still gave us a good challenge. The bathrooms were clean as well and the facility. The staff was pleasant and very friendly. We definitely will be coming back here we had an amazing experience!!"
"Escape room ""Secrets of the Master"" by Headzup in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/headzup-secrets-of-the-master,1,Awesome experience! Best escape room & archery tag was a blast! We did the Secrets of The Master escape room which was impeccable. Most escape rooms look home-made but this one was really sophisticated.

It was spacious, rather than claustrophobic, the challenges were inventive, and we had a wonderful time. Great for the whole family!"
