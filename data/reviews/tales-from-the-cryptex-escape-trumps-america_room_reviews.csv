But we loved the theme so wanted to try it out. We ended up having a blast! It was definitely challenging but not impossible. We solved it with 3 extra clues. It was very exciting to figure out the puzzles together. I highly recommend it!"

It was a very small room and maybe one couple too many, I felt a little overcrowded. It was still a fun time."

I want to go back!"
