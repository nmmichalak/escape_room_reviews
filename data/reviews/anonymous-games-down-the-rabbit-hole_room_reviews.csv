The room theming is completely immersive and the attention to detail is evident everywhere. The story is well-chosen and lends itself well to the puzzles, riddles, and game elements. Lots of fun mind teasers and elements not often found in other escape rooms make this a unique and enjoyable experience. A must-do for any real escape room fans. We will absolutely be back to visit the other rooms!"
