We looked for something new to do so the four of us me my wife son “22” and daughter “20” have this a try. What a gem Tuscaloosa has here!!! Very much a great treat for all of us!! The amazing thing is the team work that goes into it. We did the prison room and will be back to do all 4 , thanks for a great day!!!"

There were 10 of us and each of us was able to participate in the escape. It was a great way for us to get to know each other, learn to work together, and have fun while building relationships. It was really cool to see the leadership styles and problem solving skills that emerged. Best first day of school ever!!"
