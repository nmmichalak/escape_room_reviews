This was very reasonably priced and had many different themes to choose from. We did the clock tower one. The room master was very friendly, explained what was up and gave us hints at the right time without making it too easy. The immersions was top notch. Very fun, puzzles were unique and difficult, but very fun and satisfying. I’m definitely going to do more."
