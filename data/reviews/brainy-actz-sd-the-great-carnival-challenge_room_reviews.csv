"Escape room ""The Great Carnival Challenge"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-sd-the-great-carnival-challenge,0,"While visiting from Phx, I did the Carnival Room with my sister. This was a challenging room for us, in that you sometimes couldn't move on until you won a carnival game. But we DID beat the games, and we escaped and had a blast doing it! Sean was our gamemaster, and he was spot on giving us help. (Thanks, Sean!) This is an amazing place, and I recommend it for the entire family. (We are both over 60 and loved it!) I highly recommend this room for locals and travelers alike."

There were eight of us and we made it out in an hour but needed clues. Fun night, I would recommend it . Can't wait to try it again!!"
"Escape room ""The Great Carnival Challenge"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-sd-the-great-carnival-challenge,2,So much fun!! Did the carnival escape game and was surprised by how fun and interactive it was! Difficult enough to be a challenge for adult groups but not so much so that families with kids couldn't go and have a blast. Gaelin was our host and was fabulous. He was funny and made our hour in the room that much more memorable. Look forward to trying the other SD location's escape room!
