"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Wichita in Wichita",https://worldofescapes.com/wichita/quests/escapology-wichita-under-pressure,0,"4 of us came down from Topeka and did 3 rooms. First was Budapest Express. We got out in 34 minutes with zero hints. It was a fun room with some unique features. Next, we did Cuban Crisis and got out in 30 minutes with 1 hint. We struggled with Under Pressure as we made some stupid mistakes and were exhausted as this was our 8th room of the day...we needed about 2 more minutes to make it out. All in all, it was a fun time and with the drive. We will be back to do the Antidote and the Mystery room when it opens. The Alley was a cool place too!"

We were able to get out of 'Under Pressure' with just 2 of us, no clues, and in 45:46. We were very proud of ourselves due to the room's difficulty - the room was super tough (only a 20% success rate)! but the room was very well put together, the puzzles and clues seamless, and we enjoyed that we were able to work on different things at the same time. We are definitely looking forward to coming back!"
