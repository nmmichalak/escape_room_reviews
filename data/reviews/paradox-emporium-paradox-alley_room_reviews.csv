"Escape room ""Paradox Alley"" by Paradox Emporium in Bradley",https://worldofescapes.com/bradley/quests/paradox-emporium-paradox-alley,0,"Great atmosphere. Thought it was going to be some low-end place but it turned out so much better! The lobby/bar room is very nice! My group did Paradox Alley. I can't tell you how great that room was. It was high tech and well done! There were many moments where I said to myself, ""Woah! Did that just happen?!"" Great place. Will most likely come back for The Cure and future Escape Rooms!"

Such an awesome place and we had lots of fun! In the alley room, you really have to think out of the box but it's super fun! Totally recommend 4 or more people in a group because you're going to need as much brain power you can get!"
