"Escape room ""Conjurer's Dungeon"" by Conundrum Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/conundrum-escapes-conjurers-dungeon,2,"The owners of Conundrum Escapes have done a great job with their Escape rooms.  There are 2 rooms to choose from: Conjurer's Dungeon and Airship Legacy.  We chose the Dungeon and had a great time.  Since it was supposed to be a dungeon there weren't a lot of big items there which meant you had to search harder for the clues.  As with most escape rooms, you can ask for clues from the game master if you get stumped.  A really great way to spend time with friends.  Looking forward to going back."
