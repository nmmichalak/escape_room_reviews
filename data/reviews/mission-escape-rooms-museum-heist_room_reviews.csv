"Escape room "" Murder Mystery Train"" by Mission Escape Rooms in Annapolis",https://worldofescapes.com/annapolis/quests/mission-escape-rooms-museum-heist,0,We had such a fun time completing the Museum Heist! It was a great activity for all ages! Looking forward to trying one of the other challenges soon.

The decor inside this place, from the ceiling to the walls and everything inside the room itself, was exceptionally designed to create a true *experience* when you step inside. I loved the attention to detail and the whole vibe of the building. I was super impressed by the way things were put together. We did the ""museum heist"" room, which had a very Ocean's Twelve feel to it. We eventually solved the whole puzzle and escaped, but barely-- with only like 1 minute to spare. This room felt like it would've been impossible to complete without asking for a couple clues. We were completely stuck for the first half hour and started feeling pretty defeated, because we had already looked through every single object in the room and couldn't find a key- or a path to finding the key. It would be nice if they could add more puzzles to the beginning, or add more objects to the room, or alter existing clues or something to help people get the ball rolling. Once we started solving things and figuring everything out during the second half, it was a lot of fun! Difficult, but fun. I can't wait to try their ""sinking submarine"" room the next time I'm in Annapolis!"

We were so horrible at finding the clues but the staff was super friendly and didn't mind answering any questions we had-very professional! Love that the room could hold 10 of us so none of our girlfriends would have to do a different room. We couldn't believe 40 min had passed and we did get out!!!
