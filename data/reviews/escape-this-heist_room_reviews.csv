They're not actually open that day so we had the place to ourselves. We did the heist room which was SO much fun, every single one of my friends had a blast. A couple of them had been to a few other escape rooms but all admitted that this one was their favorite. The staff was super friendly during and post booking. Definitely recommend. I can't wait to go again!"
