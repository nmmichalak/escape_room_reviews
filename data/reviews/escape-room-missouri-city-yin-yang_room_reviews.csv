The staff were fun and welcoming. The Yin Yang room was tough! If we had 5 more minutes we could have finished. Our biggest mistake was not taking advantage of the clues earlier in the game. We will be going again soon to try another room.

The puzzles in the Yin Yang room were the right level of challenging and logical. The room decor and props were well made and thought out. The hosts/owners/and game masters did a great job! We will definitely be returning soon for the next challenge of the three other rooms!
