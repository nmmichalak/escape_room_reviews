"Escape room ""Mine Trap"" by Escape Room Park City in Salt Lake City",https://worldofescapes.com/slc/quests/escape-room-park-city-mine-trap,0,"First, we did this as a family; no kids. We did mine shaft. Only 2 out of 6 in our group had ever done one before but we all worked as a team; everyone relying on their own strengths and paired with everyone else’s to figure it out. It was a lot of fun and really requires everyone to participate. A very unique activity and now we’re all hooked! Can’t wait to do another one!"
