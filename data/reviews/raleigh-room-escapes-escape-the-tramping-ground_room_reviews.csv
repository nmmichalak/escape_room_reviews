"Escape room ""Contain the Tramping Ground"" by Raleigh Room Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/raleigh-room-escapes-escape-the-tramping-ground,0,Tara and Jill were fantastic! My 15-year-old son and I were able to join a group of friends in “Contain the Tramping Ground” on 8/18/18 and had a great experience. It’s the first time that an escape room I’ve participated in actually took the time to go over their observations (and explained why we were all sweating by the end.) Thanks for a fun and informative experience - we hope to be back one day soon!

RRE takes it to a whole new level; their actors are amazing at making you feel like a part of the story (my group had Jill, and she for real had me on the edge of my seat), and the room itself was like entering a new world. I felt like I was inside a video game. "
"Escape room ""Contain the Tramping Ground"" by Raleigh Room Escapes in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/raleigh-room-escapes-escape-the-tramping-ground,2,So much fun! We participated in the tramping grounds escape room. From the moment you walk in right to the end we were fully immersed in the experience. Jill was amazing and did such a great job of staying in character! She kept us laughing at the end and overall we had such a great experience. Would definitely recommend and will be going back to try the other rooms!!

Our gamemaster Jill and she was awesome and stayed in character thoughout the whole game. We were a group of four friends and were joined by four others. Everyone worked together really well and I felt like the clues were just difficult enough. Definitely recommend! And best of all, we escaped!!"
