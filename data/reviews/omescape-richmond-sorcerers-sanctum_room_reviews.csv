"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/omescape-richmond-sorcerers-sanctum,0,"My team and I went for our holiday party and everyone had a BLAST!! We played Sorcerer's Sanctum, which was quite challenging but definitely doable for experienced escape room players like ourselves. Puzzles were great and Matt was a phenomenal game master! Can't wait to try out some of their other rooms!"

My group and I played the Sorcerers Sanctum game and it's was amazing. The design is incredible and, while it was quite difficult, we were able to escape! I would definitely recommend this place"
"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/omescape-richmond-sorcerers-sanctum,2,"I've played all 3 rooms at this location (4 if you count the room they discontinued) and they are all good.  I was not a fan of the pirate / treasure themed room, but thankfully they replaced that with a room called Sorcerer's Sanctum, which is their best room yet.  The second best room is The Penitentiary and Omega is a distant third (but still enjoyable).   I would recommend the following head count for these rooms:Sorcerer's Sanctum: 6-10The Penitentiary: 4-6Room Omega: 3-5Sorcerer's Sanctum is the most satisfying of the rooms as the puzzles are straightforward and logical.  Penitentiary has one or two puzzles that make you roll your eyes when you finally get the answer because they just aren't quite fair.  Omega is a smaller room and probably better for people who are very analytical or math oriented.Overall, you really can't go wrong here.  I think this location has two of my all time favorite rooms and it even better than some of the pricier rooms in SF."
