"Escape room ""Wicked Witch's Castle"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-case-the-wicked-witchs-castle,0,"Our group of 6 did the Wicked Witch (Oz) room. This was our first time at Eludesions and we had heard that in Arizona, they probably average the largest sized rooms. It didn't disappoint! The design, props, decoration, and interactive puzzles we're very fun, tricky, and unique. We were definitely helped by our game master, as we got stuck in a couple parts, which after receiving a clue, it all made sense. So if you're used to letter locks and combo locks, you'll be challenged in this room. I would definitely recommend this room! The staff were very laid back and fun. Also, I spoke with a female staff member over the phone regarding a question I had, and she was very helpful in helping me find an answer. Then to my surprise, Bob the owner, calls me back regarding this question, and clarified the answer. He's definitely someone who's business I would like to support. Very generous gentleman, and I appreciate his customer service and business acumen. Our group will definitely come back to try all of the rooms at Eludesions (we learned it's pronounced like ""illusions"")."

We loved the first room so much (Wicked Witches Castle) that we wanted to do another one right after (Runestone). Both rooms had fantastic set designs and the puzzles were unique and definitely generation 3. Both of our game masters, Ahmed and Kyle were great as well. We will definitely be returning to do their other two rooms soon!"
