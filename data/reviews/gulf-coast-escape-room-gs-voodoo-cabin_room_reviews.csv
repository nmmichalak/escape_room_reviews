"Escape room ""The Voodoo Cabin"" by Gulf Coast Escape Room in Orange Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/gulf-shores/quests/gulf-coast-escape-room-gs-voodoo-cabin,0,"I would not suggest this room, there was 6 in our group all related but one got sick and wasn’t able to come.   We ask for a refund and was told they couldn’t do that because they had no control over what was done over the internet.   Just a few of us had ever been before and we got no where solving the clues.   We had to ask for help in every step and then ask how it was solved and we weren’t even 1/16th through it before our hour was up.   Told them that half of us just sat on the floor and we were so disappoint.   Then they told us it was difficult that they created it and they even had trouble solving it.   Maybe they should tell you this when you are checking in.  I could of found a much better way to spend my $170.  The ones who never had done this before will probably never go to another one.   I want, what a waste.   "
