"Escape room ""The Cabin"" by Excido Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/excido-escape-room-the-cabin,0,"Our family team of 6 ranged in ages from 92 to 14!  Yes, we escaped from the CABIN!!!  Everyone contributed; we were down to the last minute.  What fun, couldn't find a better experience that includes all ages.  It does help if you have done one of these escape rooms before, however, not necessary. "

There were 6 of us: age range 32 to 13 years old. We did The Cabin. Tons of great creative puzzles. We escaped with 6 minutes to spare. Love how they have a countdown timer. Room has a 30% escape rate, so we basically rocked it. We will definitely return to try the other rooms they offer."

We entered the Excido and the guy working was very nice, explained everything to us very well. There were six of us locked in a room, trying to beat the clock to get out of the cabin. The place is clean and organized. He gave us a radio for us to communicate with him, you can receive a hint. We used that up pretty quick. "
