"Escape room ""The Sorcerer's Curse"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-sorcerers-curse,0,"Arrived there on time, quick exit off highway, a couple turns and there it was. Anxious about this new room we reminisce the other 3 that we did while waiting for the setup. All were amazing and nothing compared to the other Escape rooms in Providence. Not to dis other ER but they were’nt immersive enough (in my opinion). Love the multiple rooms and tough clues! Only issue is that you can hear other players in the other room that can be distracting.Still haven’t tried the Green room, we’ll come back sometime for that. Love Lock & Clue!!! Keep coming up with more rooms!!!"

"Escape room ""The Sorcerer's Curse"" by Lock & Clue Escape Rooms in Providence",https://worldofescapes.com/providence/quests/lock-and-clue-escape-rooms-the-sorcerers-curse,2,"We did the Sorcerer's curse for my friend's birthday and we had an amazing time. We literally could not stop talking about how much fun we had once we left. This was our 5th Escape Room, but first time at Lock and Clue, and this place is definitely at the top. Fully immersive, great decor, aesthetic, and atmosphere. The puzzles were challenging, interesting clues, and a lot of cool technology. Apparently this is one of the most difficult rooms. Another thing that was cool was that it wasn't just ""one room"" we had to escape. The multiple rooms made it way more fun and moved things a long and made us more and more excited as we made progress. We can't wait to try another one here at Lock and Clue. Thanks!"
