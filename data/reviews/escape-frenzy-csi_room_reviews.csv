"Escape room ""C.S.I."" by Escape Frenzy in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escape-frenzy-csi,4,Loved this place! Went as a family of 4 and was lucky enough to be just us in the Crime Scene room. It was awesome. Son (15) and daughter (11) were in heaven as we battled time to understand the clues. Made it out with about 1:30 seconds left in our hour. Will definitely try some other rooms and may be back as a team building exercise. Our hearts were pounding the entire drive home!
