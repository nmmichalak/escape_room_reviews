"Escape room ""The Experiment"" by Escape Games NYC in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-games-nyc-the-experiment,0,Staff very enthusiastic about escape games and very professional. I highly recommend this company for the staff and design of their rooms. The Experiment was a fun room. I liked the generic but original theme and seemingly bare room. The tradition locks-based puzzles fit the generic theme. Four of us escaped in 40 min. and this room felt like the easiest of the three. A great room for teams new to escape rooms.

Although at first the venue was hard to find because it was two floors down and there was no clear sign. But, we did The Experiment and it was amazing. There was a clear, logical flow in the puzzles that helped me and my friends clear the room. It was a pretty unique escape room, unlike any that I've done before. Our game master was pretty awesome. Thanks for the great experience!"

We loved ""The Experiment"" room, lots of surprises and were only able to escape with 3 mins on the clock! Despite a minor hiccup with one puzzle/game in the room, it was so creative and definitely a challenge. The staff was attentive and watching our every move, thanks for a great time!"

What a blast. Three out of the six of us had done an escape room before, but this was great fun for the novices too. Clues were all relevant and well thought out. Almost stumped us, but we worked our way out with 10 minutes to spare!! Next NY trip we'll be trying another one of your rooms. Thank you, Escape Games NYC!"
