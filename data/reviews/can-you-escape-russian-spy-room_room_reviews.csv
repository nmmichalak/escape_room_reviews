"Escape room ""Russian Spy Room"" by Can You Escape? in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/can-you-escape-russian-spy-room,0,"We had a great time! My family of seven did the Soviet room. We had never done an escape before but decided to go big or go home and did the expert level. We worked together and made some great memories! We had some blips in the game due to the newness of the room, but we still enjoyed it. We made it out with close to 6 minutes to spare! Will definitely go again!"
