"Escape room ""The Cabin Of Doctor Bishop"" by South Side Escape Rooms in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/south-side-escape-rooms-the-cabin-of-doctor-bishop,0,This is one of the best escape rooms I have seen or heard of. It was elaborate and clever every step of the way. Our group did The Cabin of Dr. Bishop and just missed finishing by 2 minutes. I would recommend this to any group looking to have some fun and escape on the South Side of Chicago.

The Gamemaster and super dope and he did an amazing job with explaining how the rooms work for people who had not tried an escape room before. MY group was crazy fun and funny to work with and even though each of us were wearily walking into the room unsure of what to expect or if we would succeed, saving the world one clue at a time!!!"

We went as a group of three and did Dr. Bishopâ€™s Cabin, it was challenging but fun! There were so many different interactive puzzles and the owner is very nice! We definitely wanna go back and do the other room! 10/10 recommend."
