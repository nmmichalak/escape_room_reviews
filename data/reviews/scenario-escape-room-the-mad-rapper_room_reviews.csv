"Escape room ""The Mad Rapper"" by Scenario Escape Room in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/scenario-escape-room-the-mad-rapper,0,"I've played close to 100 escape rooms and Scenario Escape Room is a MUST GO. I'm all about this room- The Mad Rapper...the graffiti artwork, the music, the games, the hip hop themed room - all of it made this room hella FUN. I felt the games were different from other rooms we played which made it really unique. Not to give away too much, but there's this one room where you play a game that reminds me of one of those carni games. Loved it!!  My son who's 11 enjoyed the room and he was super helpful. If you're in SoCal, you gotta go to Scenario Escape Room and play The Mad Rapper."
