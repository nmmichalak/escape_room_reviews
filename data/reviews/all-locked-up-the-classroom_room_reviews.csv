"Escape room ""The Classroom"" by All Locked Up in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/all-locked-up-the-classroom,0,"8 friends went to All Locked Up last Saturday night. Some had tried escape rooms before but the majority had never been. Most of us didn't know what to expect. This place is AMAZING!! We had the GREATEST time escaping from The Classroom! I can't wait to go back and try all of the other rooms that are available. The location is creatively decorated, realistic and you really have to see it to believe it. They did a FANTASTIC job designing The Classroom. It's so easy to get lost in its reality and play the game to win. The owners are so friendly and so supportive and the customer service we received makes this our #1 Escape Room! We highly recommend this place for a fun night out with friends or family."

My group and I have played 100+ rooms and we loved it here! The decor in the rooms are spot on! We loved to be challenged and these guys def do that with their puzzles! We did the garage and the classroom! Both a great time I def loved the classroom there are 3 diff levels to this room junior high, high school, and now college (def expert level) the garage had that creepy vibe but nothing to scary (I'm a scary cat). Can't wait for their next room... the owners are what really makes this place... their passion for escape rooms shows..."
