Mel was a great guide for the experience. We had fun as a family trying to work out the clues. We ended up “cursed” but it was so worth the experience. We plan to come back in the summer and try a different room."
"Escape room "" Valley of the Kings"" by Puzzle Room Reno in Reno",https://worldofescapes.com/reno/quests/puzzle-room-reno-valley-of-the-kings,4,One of the best room we played ever! We are crazy about escape rooms and have played more than 50 around the World. This is probably our most favorite room ever. They have it in 2 different locations- one in Reno and one in Tahoe. The Tahoe one is the best. We tried Asylum in a reno and that one is amazing as well.
