"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-shanghaied,0,"I am sad to say this is one of my least-favorite rooms I have ever done. It's not immersive and the puzzles are very ""lock-combo"". Also, the tools for the puzzles don't really make sense for the time period of the story you are supposed to be in."

"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-shanghaied,2,Me and my friends did Shanghaied. Almost finished - just one last puzzle to open the lock to get the final key to get out. It was harder than we expected it to be.
"Escape room ""Shanghaied"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-shanghaied,3,"We've done 20+ escape rooms and were very excited to try this company. Did Budapest Express and Shanghaied and thought they were ok, but will not come back to try others.PROS: rooms are very atmospheric, excellent props and backstory, friendly customer service.CONS: All lock and key and combo-lock puzzles, not very intuitive and zero creative edge.If you're just getting started with escape rooms, it might be fun to do one of their rooms just for how immersive they are, but I feel like after you do one you'll know exactly what to expect in all of them because it's all the same lock and key puzzles, so the only thing that changes is the backstory and props."

Just walking up to it, my group noticed how inviting and established this place seemed. We added one person last minute, and they were very accommodating.My group did the Shanghaied room. It was a really awesome immersive room with quality components and interesting puzzles. Seemed like we did a lot of math, but we were okay with that. We escaped with time to spare and then enjoyed talking shop with our game master. Would love to try another room!"

Highly recommend Escapology - super fun, very classy and the game masters + staff are incredibly friendly!"

It was so good that we booked another Escapology room right there and then! Don't miss out on the fun if you're ever in Vegas!
