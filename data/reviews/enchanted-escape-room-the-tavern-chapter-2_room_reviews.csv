"Escape room ""The Tavern - Chapter 2"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-the-tavern-chapter-2,0,"As a first time escape room player I went in completely unaware of the types of puzzles to expect. The puzzles were challenging and engaging which resulted in an extremely enjoyable experience. I would highly recommend this escape room and I will be back for another challenge.  The owners did an amazing job informing the group and myself about the rules and how to play the game. After being left to find our way out of the ""TAVERN"", one of the new rooms. All the electronics worked and we used the on screen clues successfully. As a group we had fun digging through the props trying to find and decode the next clue which lead to a challenging escape."
