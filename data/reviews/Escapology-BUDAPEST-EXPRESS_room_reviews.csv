"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Las Vegas in Las Vegas",https://worldofescapes.com/las-vegas/quests/escapology-budapest-express,0,Did the Budapest express room. I'm a first timer and not very good with puzzles so wasn't expecting to enjoy it. I had a lot of fun trying anyway so don't be put off! They took a photo of us at the end and gave us some free wristbands. I would come again for another room for sure!

Escapology was surprisingly well decorated with a nice atmosphere inside. The staff was extremely nice and helpful as soon as we walked in. There was even a red carpet entrance!We chose to do the Budapest Express and was so glad that we did! This escape room had to many levels to it that it made the whole experience worth it! We will definitely be coming back to attempt their other rooms!

We chose what turned out to be the hardest room, the Budapest Express. Still, with some hints and teamwork, we managed to solve the case! The owner, Simon, and the rest of the staff were very kind and helpful. I'll definitely be back to try one of the other rooms!"
