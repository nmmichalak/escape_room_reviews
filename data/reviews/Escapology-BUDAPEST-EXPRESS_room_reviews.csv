"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/Escapology-BUDAPEST-EXPRESS,0,"Friendly and accommodating staff - I had messed up the booking process and Nivaldo took care of us and made sure we got to play anyway! Everyone we encountered was super nice and very helpful. The game itself was fun, challenging (but not impossible) and tested our team work. We will definitely be back to try another room soon!"

"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/Escapology-BUDAPEST-EXPRESS,6,"Escapology, which holds a special place in my heart for being my first escape room experience, recently opened their latest game - Budapest Express. After successfully defeating it last night, I believe they saved the best for last (or at least, for most recent).Budapest Express was the absolute perfect blend of fun and challenge. The kinds of puzzles found in the room were excellently varied. While some required us to find keys in unexpected places, others required us to put together several different clues and work out a logical puzzle, while still others necessitated a calm demeanor and focused concentration.The best aspect of Budapest Express, for me, was that it's one of the very few rooms we've experienced in which the storyline *matters*. Every escape room has a story line, whether it's a gun fight at the OK Corral, stealing a diamond from a vault, or curing a plague. But most of the time, that story is irrelevant to the puzzles you have to find and solve. Not so at Budapest Express - our roles as detectives onboard a train which had become the scene of a murder was instrumental in solving the puzzles and ""escaping"" the room. It added a very welcome layer of excitement and realism to our escape room experience.I've been impressed with Escapology since my first experience with them last year. Having now done all five of their rooms, plus 12 others at competing locations in Orlando and Tampa, I can safely say that Escapology is in the running for the most enjoyable escape room company I've visited. And it is by far the most professional. The well themed lobby and the employees with whom I've interacted create a sense that Escapology is serious business, rather than a hobby or part-time job. The game masters truly care about creating rooms that will give their customers a fantastic experience, and it shows.Another excellent quality of Escapology is that it is one of only 2 Orlando-area escape games (out of 7, at last count) that allows your party to book a room exclusive to yourselves, without the possibility of any strangers joining you. For those who want an experience with just your family and friends, Escapology is for you. Even just two of you can book the entire room for yourselves. That Escapology does this, to increase the guest experience, at the sacrifice of making more money off a room's time slot, goes to show how much they care about their customers, more than just trying to pad their bottom line.I've loved every game I've played at Escapology, and am anxiously looking forward to their 6th game, which I'm told may in fact be opening in the next couple months!"
