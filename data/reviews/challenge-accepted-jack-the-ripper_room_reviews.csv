Had a difficult time understanding the person explaing the rules.  Other than that, the puzzles and art work fit the room theme perfectly.  Had a blast and I'll definitely come back again."

All the rooms had amazing personality and Katrina was an amazing host for the rooms. The tips given by the workers for each room were very helpful and the rooms themselves were challenging but fun at the same time. Will definitely be bring others back to test more rooms!
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Challenge Accepted in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/challenge-accepted-jack-the-ripper,2,"I've been to 10+ escape rooms, and this was in the top 2 or 3.  The owner took plenty of time to explain the rules and set us up for success.  The room itself was well designed.... challenging, but not situations where the clues didn't make sense or fit the theme.  We're not locals, but we'll definitely come back if we are in town again."
