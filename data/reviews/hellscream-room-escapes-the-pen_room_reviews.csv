First time doing this with kiddos and was fun! Better than expected and a little more difficult than I thought. Really makes you use your brain! Great place, well decorated. Great actors, loved it!"
"Escape room ""The Pen"" by Hellscream Room Escapes in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/hellscream-room-escapes-the-pen,1,We joined a group for the pen escape. We selected normal difficulty and scary. There were multiple rooms to navigate through and several actors that came in and out adding to our experience. This was a great experience and I can’t wait to come back again. Now I’m really looking forward to the haunted house for Halloween!

Everything down to details was amazing we opted for the scary version (which it's pretty Erie as it is) we did the Pen Escape room and it was a blast! The actors are amazing and the staff were accommodating! We are so excited to book another room with them! Hands down best escape room"
