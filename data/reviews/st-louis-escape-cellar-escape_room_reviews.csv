"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by St. Louis Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/st-louis-escape-cellar-escape,0,"We did the Cellar and loved it! The props and design were amazing compared to the others Iâ€™ve been to. I liked that you had to get through multiple rooms. However, it was a little difficult trying to fit 10 people in these rooms. I only wish that we had a little more guidance in the beginning (the lady talked really fast). I would definitely come back to try the other rooms."
"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by St. Louis Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/st-louis-escape-cellar-escape,1,"Overall this escape room experience was awesome! The props, set design, and puzzles are all meticulously executed. However, the rooms show some serious degeneration and destruction from other clients who try to muscle open doors, locks, and other props. Lots of sticky padlocks, paint rubbed off of things, props ripped open, etc. These were time-consuming and frustrating for the gamers. It was difficult to hear the game operator at times.Also, this (The Cellar Experience) was more physically demanding than other escape rooms I have been too. Do not wear nice clothes; my jeans were pretty much ruined from crawling through dirty ducts on dirty concrete floors.Again, overall an amazing game play experience. Some cleaning and upkeep would make this a 5-Star experience."
