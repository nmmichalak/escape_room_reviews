A lot of care went into crafting this scenario, and I'd recommend locals to check it out sometime. We had the pleasure of meeting Miss Mavis MacGillicutty last night. Her kind, nurturing voice infrequently chiming in to guide our escape was a highlight of this trip. When I voiced concerns that I wasn't contributing to the goal, she chimed in, letting me know that what I'd uncovered would help us to escape. In another circumstance, an omniscient voice heard from a small talkbox would creep me out, but it just put a smile on my face. And she was right -- the couple of clues I discovered did get us out of the room! Good luck to anyone taking on this quest -- you'll love it!"
