"Escape room ""The Family Jewels"" by Idaho Escape Rooms in Idaho Falls",https://worldofescapes.com/idaho-falls/quests/idaho-escape-rooms-the-family-jewels,0,"I cannot think of a better way to spend an hour with family and/or friends…stealing grandma’s fortune! Teamwork is a must in this fun, interactive, challenging experience. Our camera operator and hint master was most helpful, when asked, in such a comical manner you couldn’t help but laugh, and we were able to solve the puzzles and find the fortune with just a few hints. I will definitely go again and experience different rooms as they develop them. Highly recommend for a new and fun experience!"
