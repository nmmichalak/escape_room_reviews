It was exciting fun and extremely entertaining. The hour passed so quickly! The people we were teamed up with were great, the owner was fantastic, friendly, accommodating and went out of his way to make sure we had fun.I highly recommend this place. I am planning to go back and try the other 2 games they have!"

"Escape room ""The Cambridge Killer"" by Miami Quest Escape Rooms in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/miami-quest-escape-rooms-cambridge,2,"My boyfriend & I decided to do the Cambridge killer. Since I love csi! It was so fun and challenging. We were suppose to be a team of 6 and the other people didn't show up. So we got to be our own team, which ended up being perfect. At first we had no idea if we could do this. But than you start using your brain and figuring things out, it gets more exciting and fun. We had an amazing experience. We worked together and solved the case, all on our own! A different kind of date night and we can't wait to go back and do the other two quests! Nice owner! Check it out!!"
