"Escape room ""Kidnapped!"" by Green Light Escape Room in Wilmington",https://worldofescapes.com/wilmington/quests/the-breakout-room-kidnapped,0,"Our first time participating in an escape room. We did Kidnapped. It was myself, my husband and our 13 year old son. We had a blast. We loved that it was a private booking so we could enjoy the experience as a family. Highly recommend."

The ""Kidnapped"" game was so much fun and a great team building experience for my co-workers and I. I highly recommend The Breakout Room to everyone! The staff was also very friendly and hilarious!"
