My dad and I went back the next night to do a second room, we loved it so much. The people running it were great too, especially Jamie. The new room, Hexadron, was awesome! Thanks for running such a great place to escape to (and from!) !"

We booked the Hexadron room & escaped with 2 minutes left! It was such a fun night working together to figure out the clues! You really have to think outside of the box but our game host gave us great clues without giving it away! The staff was awesome! I would recommend this activity for all ages & groups! Can't wait to go back & try a different room!
