Will definitely go back with more friends."

"Escape room ""Try-Wizard Tournament"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/square-room-escape-try-wizard-tournament,2,"Square Room Escapes is a decent escape room (nothing crazy elaborate set wise) but they have some fun puzzles.  We did the ""wizard"" room a couple years back and it was quite enjoyable.  We managed to escape with a few seconds to spare.  Nice time, very professional, and I was happy that it was a private room."
