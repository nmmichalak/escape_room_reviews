We stopped in over the holiday and escaped The Tomb! So much fun and a great making memories opportunity. Our group of 8 (ages 8-48) all had a blast and learned a thing or two about working together. Put down the devices, unplug for an hour with your family for a great adventure while supporting the business of a Northern Communications Alum. Anna was a fantastic host and we loved her enthusiasm and positivity to create a great experience for families and groups!"

We had a lot of laughs and worked as a team to escape before our hour was up. I have been telling everyone they need to go and check it out. It was definitely worth it and we look forward to going back and trying a different room!
