"Escape room ""Escape from the Wizard Realm"" by Family Fun Escape Rooms in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/family-fun-escape-rooms-escape-from-the-wizard-realm,0,"Our kids love this and I love being able to share our favorite activity with them. My husband and I do about 2-4 escape rooms a month on date nights and our kids always beg to do one with us. We have taken them with us to some adult rooms, but it's great to have age appropriate options! We have done both the Wizard and Dinosaur themed rooms. I felt the wizard room was a little better put together than the dinosaur room as far as attention to detail is concerned, but my kids(5 and 9) thoroughly enjoyed both. I mean not super high quality production value to be honest, but I like that there are a variety of rooms to choose from. My kids were engaged and that is what I was looking for. The owners have taken time to chat with us on both visits. We always request the puzzles be set to their most challenging level so that my husband and I can enjoy the experience more, but I love the option of being able to make it easier if my 9 year old ever wanted to try it alone with friends. I give 5 stars because these really are well done for the younger audience. Probably not going to satisfy hard core escape enthusiasts, but that isn't the target here. If you want to do something active, engaging and different with your kids, definitely give this individually owned escape room a try. I firmly believe in supporting the independent escape games in the area."

"Escape room ""Escape from the Wizard Realm"" by Family Fun Escape Rooms in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/family-fun-escape-rooms-escape-from-the-wizard-realm,2,"Totally awesome place!    Had my daughter's 9th birthday party in the Wizard room.  The room was great, and the kids had so much fun!    By the end of the party I felt like SuperMom for my brilliant idea.  Husband was surprised at how reasonably priced it was.  Employees were so friendly and helpful at the party.  It felt like there was extra relatives there to assist.  It is a bit of a drive for us, so we won't be able to come often.   But, we might have her 10th party there.   So, if your kid has an early-June birthday, forget everything I said.   It was horrible!   :)"
