"Escape room ""Tiger's Eye"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-tiger-eye,0,This was the first time for us all. We were successful in heisting the Tiger's Eye. Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was a fun experience for our three-generation family of 10. We all said we're interested in doing another one.

The room itself had really interesting and state-of-the-art technology and was filled with many puzzles, difficult enough to keep us entertained but not impossible to solve. A great room for experienced players. The staff was also very friendly."
