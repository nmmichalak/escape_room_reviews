"Escape room ""7 Deadly Sins"" by Escapology Burnsville in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escapology-burnsville-7-deadly-sins,0,"We played Seven Deadly Sins tonight and had Vivian as our game master, she was great and gave us little nudges when we we close and needed that little extra to finish the puzzle. The room was great, really made us feel that we were in a graveyard. The puzzles were challenging and made you think as long as you worked as a team. Can't wait for the last room to come in. Thanks for the great time Vivian and the rest of the Escapology team."
