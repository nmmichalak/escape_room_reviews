Went with my husband and four 14-year-old boys. We did the Saloon and escaped with a minute and a half left. Exciting, fun, and totally worth the price! The girl who was our guide was super friendly. I can't wait to go again! My heart was beating so fast when we opened the door. It was such a rush!"
