"Escape room ""Licastro’s Lair"" by Springfield Escape Room in Springfield (MO)",https://worldofescapes.com/springfield-mo/quests/springfield-escape-room-licastros-lair,1,We had a blast in the vampire themed room. Anything that has a creepy feel to it appeals to me anyway. Would be perfect for this fall as Halloween gets closer. I'm excited to go again and try a different story line. Lots of fun and laughs. Definitely puts your brains to work. Highly recommend!!!

They made my wedding proposal extra memorable. Licastro’s Lair was the theme of our room. Though we didn't ""escape"" we still had a blast in this fun and challenging room. I highly recommend you give them a shot. We'll definitely be back!"
