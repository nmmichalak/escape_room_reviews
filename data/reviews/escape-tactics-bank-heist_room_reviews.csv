It was a blast! I'd definitely come back and give one of the other rooms a try. If you come here with a group of people you know, you'll have an amazing time and make great memories."
"Escape room ""Bank Heist"" by Escape Tactics in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-tactics-bank-heist,1,Our first experience with escape room adventures. We made it out just as the alarm was sounding. What FUN! The Bank Heist was beautifully done with antiques and period novelties. The staff was AMAZING! They made the experience!! We are already getting friends together to do The Speakeasy. Worth the ticket price!!

If I had more time in Ft. Myers, I would go again and try the Speakeasy room (I did the bank heist). Also, David was fantastic! He was very encouraging and explained everything very well."

Did the Bank Heist room and beat it BARELY! What an amazing time.. The owner was so enthusiastic about our win; she legitmately was ecstatic for us that we escaped with the loot! Over and above helpful both before, during, and after the game. Brought my wife as a surprise and she didn't know what to think at first but left in love with it and we felt so goof about ourselves that we had the communication to get through it."
