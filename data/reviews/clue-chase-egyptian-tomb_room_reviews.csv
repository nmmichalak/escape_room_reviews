"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,0,"My family and I did the ""Egyptian Tomb"" room on December 26, 2017 and it was GREAT.  Six of us were experienced escapers and two of us were newbies.The location is gorgeous! When you walk in, they have some of the coolest puzzles in the waiting room.The production value of the room was easily the best I've seen. Decorations, lighting, etc. were all really immersive. They even had Egyptian costumes you could wear while playing.  (Or just for the photo at the end!)The room was also super challenging yet accessible for our newer players.The President of the company Dave Chase was manning the front desk, made sure we all had a great time, gave us his card, and encouraged us to come and complete the other three rooms.  Customer service in general was super friendly.We'll be going back.  (Oh, and we made it out of the room!)"
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,1,"A group of 7 friends and I completed the Egyptian Tomb challenge with 12 minutes to spare, which felt pretty great considering the 30% success rate.  I've done quite a few escape rooms over the years, and this is by far one of the best! The staff is informative and entertaining, and the production value is among the upper echelon of escape rooms. There are levers, locks, and secret passages galore, and the creative puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. "
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,2,We finished! Really fun. We did the Egyptian Tomb escape and had a blast. Would recommend it.
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,3,We had a terrific time at the Egyptian Tomb! Professor Colgate is hilarious and provides just the right amount of guidance and the rest is up to you! We got out in 57 minutes!!! Woo hoo!
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,4,"I've been to 5-6 different escape the room companies to date, and Clue Chase has definitely been one of the best so far. Our group of six set out to conquer the Egyptian Tomb, and we got out with 30 seconds to spare! The set was beautiful, with the puzzles being both fun and challenging. At other companies where the production value was not as high, important contraptions would break or malfunction, but we encountered no such problems here. The clue masters also helped us along the way, which our group took full advantage of. At the end of the hour we were able to take a fun group photo with themed props, which was a nice little touch to finish off the experience.Tickets are $29 pp, comparable to other places in NYC. We had a great time and look forward to returning for the other rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Egyptian Tomb"" by Clue Chase in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/clue-chase-egyptian-tomb,5,"My friends and I are escape veterans, so of course we were eager to try out a brand new escape room. I have now tried 9 different escape rooms from 3 different companies, and I've got to say, the Egyptian Tomb room at Clue Chase is definitely in my top 3. The attention to detail is unlike any other room I've escaped from (the owner David told us set artists from Boardwalk Empire helped put together some of the most elaborate props!) We will definitely be returning to try the Cold War room next. Be warned though, these escape rooms are TOUGH...but not impossible. The Egyptian Tomb room is designed in such a way that there a variety of paths a team could take towards the end of the hour to complete the final steps towards escape. I highly recommend cheking this place out!"
