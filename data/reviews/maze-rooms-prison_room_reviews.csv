If you love adventure, want to spent great time with friends, and you are looking for unique entertaining experience, - this place is for you. The design of the maze room makes you feel as if you were really locked in a medieval castle. The puzzles keep you challenged all the time. Every time you find a new hint, you feel truly excited! And when you finally unlock the very last door, and step out of ""prison"", you feel like popping a bottle of champagne."
"Escape room ""Prison"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-prison,6,"Prison - The weak part of this room was certain puzzles could be better camouflaged to blend into the environment better, with one of the puzzles that could be subjective, which slowed our group down. Otherwise, this was an excellent and very fun room. We attempted to do something using our mouths which was the wrong way to go at it, but made us all laughed either way. Loved starting off in different prison cells and working together to escape. Both the Motel and Prison are located in the same location."
