"Escape room ""A Knight To Escape"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-a-knight-to-escape,0,"We have played 2 games at The Escape Effect now and canâ€™t say enough great things! The owner is extremely friendly and clearly passionate about escape games! We played the new 2 hour A Knight to Escape and it has been one for the books for sure. Both the design and concept were amazing and have surpassed all others in the area, imho. As a family we have played well over 20 games or so and this has been a favorite by far! Please check this place out and support this local business!!"

I went there with my group the evening of 8/4/19. After scouring the Internet looking for an escape room we picked this one because of the 2 hour 'A knight to escape'. It was an absolute blast! We were so impressed we decided to do another one, 'Sherlock Studies'. Again, it was amazing and we had so much fun! I cannot say enough good things about this place! The couple that owns this place is amazing and so friendly- they've put their blood, sweat and tears into this place and it shows. There are so many little details to appreciate in the building and in the rooms. If you want a memorable experience and fun time, this is the place to come! Also, for those wondering, when we booked our party, it was just us- we we weren't paired with strangers (some places do that) which made the experience so much better! They also will give you as much or as little help as you want (other places give you a max of 3 questions). I will alway recommend this place and will be returning for sure!!!! thank you for being Awesome!!"

We were separated most of the time working together between rooms to solve clues. It was super involving and puzzles /clues to next puzzle flowed smoothly. Everything in this room was amazing and high quality. We highly recommend The Escape Effect."
