We did the News Room which was fun and engaging, but largely linear. Three adults and two kids had a great hour and then walked to Hard Rock!"
"Escape room ""The News Room"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-news-room,6,"Went to Escape the Room during a family ""girls weekend"" in Atlanta. There were 9 of us, ranging in age from 20's to 70's. Several of us had done an escape room before and loved it so wanted to share it with the group. Unfortunately I didn't really care for the ""News Room"". This room wasn't as logical compared to previous rooms I had done which I found frustrating. I can't include more specifics without giving away details of the room! Staff was friendly and helpful, I just didn't care for this particular room. We lost of course, but I don't think that's clouding my judgement! =)"
