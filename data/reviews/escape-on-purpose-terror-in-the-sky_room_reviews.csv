"Escape room ""(T)Error in the Sky"" by Escape on Purpose in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-on-purpose-terror-in-the-sky,0,We had a group of 6 friends and we have all done escape rooms before. We loved the (T)Error in the Sky and barely got out. The rooms had amazing props (an actual plane cabin) and lots of puzzles to solve. This is an awesome escape room and I would recommend it. We plan to go back to try the other 2 rooms soon.
"Escape room ""(T)Error in the Sky"" by Escape on Purpose in Raleigh - Durham",https://worldofescapes.com/raleigh/quests/escape-on-purpose-terror-in-the-sky,1,Went for my first trip to Escape on Purpose last night and had a blast! The owners were incredibly nice and I really love how a portion of the proceeds go to charity (they have 3 you can choose from). We did the airplane room. It was challenging and well thought out. I will definitely be going back!

Our group of four was able to escape with just minutes to spare. We canâ€™t wait to attempt the other rooms."
