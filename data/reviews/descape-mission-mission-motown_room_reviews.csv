It was great! Difficult puzzles, but not impossible. The room was not as immersive as some escape rooms we have done, but still a great experience. The hosts were great. Clues were given promptly and were very helpful without giving us total answers. We'll be back for sure!"

The hospitality was amazing. We had a great time. We all found clues and worked together to figure the room out. We had a lot of fun!"

Loved the challenge and loved the kind staff! But the best part was watching our group of 10 friends work together to figure it all out. I'm totally coming back to try another room!!
