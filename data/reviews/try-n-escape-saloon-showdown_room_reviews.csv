"Escape room ""Saloon Showdown"" by Try'n Escape in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/try-n-escape-saloon-showdown,0,"My friends and I love this escape room, Ingrid and her son Logan are so great and have made our experience unforgettable every time. The Sinking Ship is such a fun room where you are split up and have to work together in order to succeed. The Saloon Showdown room was super fun as well and really made us feel like we were trying to steal from the James gang. The rooms are beautiful, the stories are great, and the puzzles are really fun. I hear they are building a new room that will be a subway station scenario and i cant wait to get out there and try it. Try'n Escape is a must go for anyone looking for an all around great escape room."

We did the Saloon - one senior, one adult, and one 11 year old. We got stuck on a couple tangents and didn't get out of the room, but we had a blast trying to solve the clues and were so excited when we left we really wanted to try it again. The rooms are creative and full of fun surprises. Definitely worth a visit. We'll be back! I only wish they had more rooms so we'd have more to try. :)"
