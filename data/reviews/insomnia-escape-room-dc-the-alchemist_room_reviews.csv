The clues were clever, the room was surprising and we escaped with thirty seconds to spare! This was my first one and I would highly recommend. I hope to return to Insomnia Escape Room to try another."

"Escape room ""The Alchemist"" by Insomnia Escape Room DC in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/insomnia-escape-room-dc-the-alchemist,4,One of my favorite Escape Rooms I have played. We did the Alchemist room and it was really awesome. I highly recommend it as one of the top games in the D.C./NOVA area. Played it as the second part of a double header coming from another companies big expensive room right down the street. Insomnia blew them away in terms of game quality.
