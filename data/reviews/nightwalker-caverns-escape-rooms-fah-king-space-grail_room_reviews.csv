"Escape room ""Fah-king Space Grail"" by Nightwalker Caverns Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/nightwalker-caverns-escape-rooms-fah-king-space-grail,2,"We came here as a team building thing with some of my team teachers. We had so much fun. Having never done an escape room before, I was not sure what to expect. The puzzles were engaging and each unique. The story lines within each unique section of the puzzle kept our team active the entire time. We did the space themed room with 4 people and that felt about the right amount. I would highly recommend a trip to Nightwalker Caverns for any reason! I especially enjoyed that it is opened and operated as a family business. The father/daughter team were very passionate about the amount, variety, and complexity of puzzles. They're even traveled world-wide in their escape room quests. Again, highly, highly, highly recommend!!!"
