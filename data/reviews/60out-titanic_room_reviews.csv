"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,0,"Captain Judy is so amazing and funny. She is there to help you out when needed when you give her the correct call to request the help. The Titanic room has about 3 rooms you need to break through to end the game. It's so much fun, just remember to talk out loud with your team, this is not a figure out yourself type of game, or you cover that area and I cover that area. It's really a group effort. "
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,1,We did the Titanic Room with a group of 3 on Sunday. Our little group was pretty new to the escape room scene and we were pretty excited to check it out. The building doesn't look like much from the outside but it's super cute on the inside. Captain Judy explained the scenario and told us how to get hints if we needed them (we needed them!). I don't want to give anything away but all of the rooms were decorated great and we had a fun time figuring out the various puzzles.

Our friends had done an escape room before with 60out at a different location. Ivan oriented us with the do's and don'ts of the rooms and then we were off on the Titanic (yes, I had a sinking sensation going in). This is not an activity for someone with claustrophobia. Figuring out the clues is very challenging, and we did need to get an assist from ""Captain Ivan"" more than once. But we did escape at 59.5 minutes. And we agreed that we would return for another room in the near future!"
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,3,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these. The rooms are set up sooo well and the puzzles are challenging. Not a lot of locks to unlock, I have nothing against opening a lot of locks, I actually like it but these rooms are so incredibly creative that they are amazing. Also, when they give you hints they are very vague and get you thinking so they don't just give away the answers which I appreciate. They also don't put any other players you don't know in the room with you which is a requirement for us.We've done the Titanic and Zen Room at the Marina Del Ray location and Senator Payne at the West LA location. Judy was our Game Master at the Marina location for both rooms. She was amazing! She was so fun and you could tell she really loves her job. We will be back in a couple weeks to do Outbreak Judy!"

The lobby area is cozy, spacious, and even houses a couple of small games. This was our second escape room experience, and the design of the rooms was top-notch! The difficulty was noticeably harder than our first room, but some puzzles were exceptionally clever! Our game master, Judy, did a great job providing useful hints without directly giving the answer away. Thanks for being so patient with us!"
