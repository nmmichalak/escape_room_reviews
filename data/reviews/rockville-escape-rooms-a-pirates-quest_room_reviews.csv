"Escape room ""A Pirate's Quest"" by Rockville Escape Rooms in Rockville",https://worldofescapes.com/rockville/quests/rockville-escape-rooms-a-pirates-quest,0,A pretty straightforward entry level room. Probably best for much younger players. A veteran group should breeze through the room without challenge -  if not for all of the broken equipment. Puzzles can be done in parallel. Room could definitely use a refurbishment.

We went for my son's 16th birthday with a group of his friends and did the Pirate Quest. We had an awesome time and escaped with 2 minutes to spare. Customer service was great. I think there is room for improvement as far as the quality of the clues and the artifacts in the room, but overall we were very pleased with our experience and will definitely go again!"
