We had so much fun working together to find the clues. The room is very interactive and one of the best escape rooms I've done. Our host, Amanda, was awesome! We already bought our tickets for the next room!"

We were about five minutes from breaking out. I appreciate how One Way Out uses story-driven rooms that build on one another. The Patient is next up for our team.
