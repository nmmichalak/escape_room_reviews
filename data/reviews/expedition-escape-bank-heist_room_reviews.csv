We did the Bank Heist room and with a mere 44 clues (Thanks, Phil!!), and 2 minutes left we managed to escape.  It was no easy task.    Challenging to say the least."

The group had a lot of fun.  Creative puzzles.  Our guide, Austin, did a good job throwing us hints only when we really needed them.  I was happy that the room was kept cool, but if you get cold easily, take a sweatshirt.  We'll go again."

It was such a great experience. We had a party of 8 people and it was a perfect size. Diane was our guide and she was phenomenal. We are looking forward to doing another expedition soon!
