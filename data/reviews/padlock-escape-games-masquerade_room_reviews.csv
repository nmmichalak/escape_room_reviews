"Escape room ""Murder Mystery Masquerade"" by Padlock Escape Games in College Station",https://worldofescapes.com/college-station/quests/padlock-escape-games-masquerade,0,"The best part of this escape room is that many people can be involved at a time.  They have lots of concurrent puzzles for this reason.  However, some puzzles were executed so that (as they stated) you had to ask for clues.  I personally prefer their other two rooms because they make more sense.  However, I did escape and enjoy the hour."
