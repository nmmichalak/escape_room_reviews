"Escape room ""The Missing Five"" by Locked Up Philly in Philadelphia",https://worldofescapes.com/philly/quests/locked-up-philly-the-missing-five,0,"Well constructed room. Countdown clock in room. Doesn't have the typical combination lock puzzles; instead uses some clever and novel ways to ""unlock"" the next puzzle., even more so than 1409. It's one of the more physical rooms we've done.  It's not scary. It's a little creepy if you've seen the ""Saw"" movies, but not that bad if you aren't familiar with those movies.  Suitable for a group of 3-4. Overall a very fun room."
