"Escape room ""The Royal Heist"" by Escape Room 51 in Pittsburgh",https://worldofescapes.com/pittsburgh/quests/escape-room-51-the-royal-heist,0,DO NOT GO. we paid for 8 tickets online for 8:15 PM. we arrived 10 min early and the place was closed. All phone numbers are disconnected and a bunch of mail on the floor. We waited for hour and half and no employee showed. I tried every form of contact but recieved no answer. Escape Room 51 kept my payment. I had to turn them into my credit company as a fraud and now Discover is trying to make contact as well. VERY unhappy!!! Stay far away. $260 down the drain

I am so glad we decided to do this. We will definitely be going back to try The Mission to Mars. For a great time, try to crack the code in the Royal Heist room. We did!"
