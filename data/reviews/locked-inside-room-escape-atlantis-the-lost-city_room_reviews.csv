"Escape room ""Atlantis: The Lost City"" by Locked Inside Room Escape in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/locked-inside-room-escape-atlantis-the-lost-city,2,We were so close to escaping!! We had a great time solving clues in the Atlantis room! Staff was very friendly and helpful and we liked that there was varying difficulty in the clues so you could make progress and it was still a challenge! Will definitely be back to try another room!
