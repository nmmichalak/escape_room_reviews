"Escape room ""Nautilus"" by Project: Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/project-escape-nautilus,0,"We had 7 people in the Nautilus room, which was a good fit. The puzzles were intriguing and the room was full of surprises. It was tougher than I expected, but we escape with almost 9 minutes! Had a great time and would definitely go again."

The puzzles fit the theme, the decor helps to immerse yourself in the setting and the Game Masters are very friendly and informative. We will definitely be visiting Project Escape again."

We cannot wait to try to other rooms. The decoration and themes were on point!
