"Escape room ""Captain's Quarters"" by Alton Room Escape in St. Louis",https://worldofescapes.com/st-louis/quests/alton-room-escape-captains-quarters,0,"Myself and eight other newbies decided to take this on and I had a frustrating blast! We had no idea what to expect and nothing to compare it to but the room was way more detailed than I would have thought. The clues were difficult but help was always available if needed. We did the ""moderate"" level and sadly, we did not save the Captain.The owner really seemed to care that we enjoyed ourselves and it was obvious he/they had put a lot of thought into the entire experience. If anyone is on the fence about trying this, do it! Seriously fun, very challenging and an overall great time!"

There were 8 of us, with two people who had previously done escape rooms. The moderate level was great for us, challenging but not impossible. The owners gave us a walkie-talkie to allow us to ask for a nudge in the right direction when we were getting hung up on something. They were a fun, friendly couple, and the room had a fun theme with great details! I can't wait to try a new room!"

However, once we arrived and got into the room it was so fun!! The room feels like you are really in a Captain's Quarters. It is definitely hard but we asked for help and/or were given help when needed and almost made it out. Definitely can't wait until their next room is open in November!"
