The room itself is brilliantly decorated like a medieval castle to set the scene. The clues will keep you on your toes the entire game, the puzzles are a fun mix of math, visual and dexterity. The game masters who host the location are fun and make the whole experience wonderful! The location is easy to get to and well maintained. We will be coming back for more fun!"
