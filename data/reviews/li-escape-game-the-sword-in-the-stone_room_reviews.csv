"Escape room ""Battle for the Throne"" by LI Escape Game in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/li-escape-game-the-sword-in-the-stone,0,"Went with one child and three adults just to try something to do. The reviews on here actually spurred me to be a little more excited than I otherwise would have been. It was a blast. The effort to get out of the room is not easy, but it is cool as heck trying to work it out with people in your group. You work together, have a great time, and have 'aha' moments when you figure some of the tougher things out. The people there couldn't have been nicer as well."
"Escape room ""Battle for the Throne"" by LI Escape Game in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/li-escape-game-the-sword-in-the-stone,1,There were 9 of us in the room - all family and various ages from 21 to 63 and we had a blast! Only 1 of us ever went through an escape room before so we were definitely novices. Thank goodness for the game master because we might still be in there without the great clues she provided to us. And to our surprise we got out with about 1 minute to spare! We all want I do another one again soon!

This was so much fun. You may ask questions prior to entering the escape room. It is not claustrophobic at all. You do not need to have physical brawn but you do need mental brawn.And yes we escaped!Fun Fun Fun!
