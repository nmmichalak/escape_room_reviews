"Escape room ""Area 51"" by Twin Peaks Escape Room in Longmont",https://worldofescapes.com/longmont/quests/twin-peaks-escape-room-area-51,1,"We had a fantastic time working out all the challenging puzzles in the Area 51 room.We barely escaped with time left on the clock, about 11 min. Working the room took some creative thinking and everyone was happily engaged in the escape. The staff is friendly, welcoming and helpful with hints (only when requested).We will definitely return to escape the Yin/Yang room. And by the signs of some construction in the back, it appears more rooms are on the way."

We managed to find the secret of Area 51, but we cut it closer than we would've liked!Location is growing and is great for private events.  We love that they guarantee we'll have the room all to ourselves and that they have a point system to make it worth coming back to do the other room!We love this place and can't wait to come back!"
