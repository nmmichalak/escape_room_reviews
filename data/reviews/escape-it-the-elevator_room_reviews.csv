"Escape room ""The Elevator"" by Escape It in Baltimore",https://worldofescapes.com/baltimore/quests/escape-it-the-elevator,0,This was my first Escape room. I was with a church youth group. The Elevator Room was very well planned. It definitely made you think. Would love to go back with adults to figure out the other two rooms.
