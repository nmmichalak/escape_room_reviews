"Escape room ""Cell Block 9"" by Great Escape of Central Texas in Killeen",https://worldofescapes.com/killeen/quests/Great-Escape-of-Central-Texas-BOMB-ROOM,1,"We had an awesome time at our first escape, so much so that we went back to a second room the same night! We tried our Lost and Bank Heist, I would recommend both! Definitely a lot of fun for a family, team, or co-workers to bond and build communication skills. My friend and I went with a group of strangers and it was still a blast."
