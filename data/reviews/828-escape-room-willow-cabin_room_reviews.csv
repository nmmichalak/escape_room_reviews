"Escape room ""Willow Cabin"" by 828 Escape Room in Sylva",https://worldofescapes.com/sylva/quests/828-escape-room-willow-cabin,0,"Willow Cabin is horror themed and immersive. I’m a horror fan and I enjoyed this room a lot, squealing at few moments but it is no more terrifying than a PG-13 movie. If you are sensitive to low light I would advise another room. That’s all I’ll say about the room itself.The staff were extremely friendly and excited to answer questions and help us. 5/5 company and room. I’d definitely play again."
