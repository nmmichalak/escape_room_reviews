This was my husband’s and my second escape room and our two friends’ first. Challenging and creatively designed, the room we played (Deepsky) had a lot going on and would be good with a slightly larger group (maybe 6-8). The owners are really nice people, too. We’ll be back, next time with a more organized strategy!"
