"Escape room ""Mad Lab: Resurrection"" by Great Room Escape San Diego in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/great-room-escape-sd-mad-lab-resurrection,0,"This was SO scary!!! We arrived with a group of 10 and did the mad lab. It was everybody's first time so we didn't know what to expect. We all had to sign a waiver and listen to instructions beforehand. You are not allowed to bring phones and purses. You will have to put it in a bin that will be in the same room with you. For the actual escape room, most of the times, we were screaming and scrambling so it was very hard to think while a chained up radioactive professor was chasing you. My heart was pumping pretty fast and my adrenaline was rushing. The mad scientist who was supposed to be our helper and guide, scared us even more! This was definitely not an easy escape room. We didn't make it in the 1 hr limit but it was still so much fun + SCARY! Definitely  check in yelp for the free extra hint because you will need it! Kudos to you if you can solve this escape room with no hints!"

I thought it might be kind of awkward doing it with strangers but once the timer started we easily got into the groove as a team. I definitely enjoyed my time and will be going back to try another one. Whether you're going for a date, girls night, or team building I highly recommend Great Room Escape!"

We had a great time. The level of difficulty was challenging but not impossible. We did the ""Mad Lab"" scenario. There is a zombie on a chain and as time ticks by, the chain gets longer. If he touches you they put you in a cell and you have to answer questions to get out. Having this element added to the game definitely made it interesting and kept us on our toes!The staff was nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this one!"
