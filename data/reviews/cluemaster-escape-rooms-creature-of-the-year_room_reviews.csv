"Escape room ""Creature of the Year"" by Cluemaster Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/cluemaster-escape-rooms-creature-of-the-year,2,"This was one of the better escape rooms we've done. They asked us how difficult we liked it, and customized the room to fit our group of 9 people (mostly kids). We asked for a difficult room, and we definitely got one! We were able to escape with only 5 minutes to spare, which is far more enjoyable than escaping too early. The ambiance was great, and there was a good mix of puzzle types. We will be back when the Shawshank room opens!"

Michael was so thorough explaining the locks, how to get ""hints"" and story behind the room. Although this was my first experience in an escape room, I was with others who had done several. We all agreed that this was the best escape room ever! I plan to return and would highly recommend Cluemaster Escape Rooms to anyone looking for a great, entertaining way to spend an evening.. Thanks Michael!"

It was the first escape room any of us had done, and I will admit some of us were a little skeptical about it going in. But we all got really into it and had a blast! We're looking forward to going back when the next room opens. Thanks for a great time!"
