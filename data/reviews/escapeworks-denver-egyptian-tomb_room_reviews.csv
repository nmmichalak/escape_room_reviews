It was a bit dark, but that added to the atmosphere. The puzzles were challenging. We managed to make it out with just a few minutes to spare. This is definitely one of the best escape rooms we've done."
"Escape room ""Egyptian Tomb"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-egyptian-tomb,2,We had a blast! There were three of us and we escaped with 6 minutes to go. We did the Egyptian room. I would highly recommend it! The scenario does tax your problem-solving skills and we needed several hints but I felt a great sense of accomplishment on solving the riddle. We plan to do another one.
