"Escape room ""Submarine Survival"" by Breakout Games - Dayton in Dayton",https://worldofescapes.com/dayton/quests/breakout-games-dayton-submarine-survival,0,"My fiance and I went with a group of friends and it was a BLAST! We did the submarine treasure hunt and it was a ton of fun! It was very interactive with some puzzles requiring lots of teamwork, communication, and thinking. Our handler/ guide Sarah was the best! She was fantastic at giving hints when asked without giving too much away, just enough to point us in the right direction so we were never too far off course and could easily get back on track. I can't wait to find the time to go back again and try one of the other rooms!"
