Everything was perfect. From the excellent customer service to the cleanliness of each room, I had the best experience ever! We did the Playground room, which was so fun and nostalgic, but I can't wait to try all the other rooms. Shout out to Oscar and Haylyn for being awesome!10/10 would recommend!"

We held a team-building event for a group of twelve in the Playground room. The game was highly engaging, fun, and just the right amount of challenging. Our group was twelve people, the maximum for the room. I would recommend a slightly smaller group, because in such a large group, people could disengage.Overall we had a great experience and recommend The Escape Game for small team-building events."
"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-playground,3,Played Playground a few days ago with some friends and it was such a good experience. This was my first escape room and it was more than what I expected! The room was aesthetically pleasing. It really looked like a classroom which brought back some memories. Our game guide was also really friendly and helpful. Made us feel at home. Great experience and would recommend to other friends for sure!

All the staff were extremely nice and helpful especially @oscar and @haylyn. The room itself was right on theme with a 4th grade classroom and playground set. I definitely recommend coming here - I know I'll be back to finish the rest of the rooms! Thank you so much for the experience!"
