"Escape room ""The Da Vinci Experience"" by Escapade 360 in Chicago",https://worldofescapes.com/chicago/quests/escapade-360-the-da-vinci-experience,0,"My husband and I took our two teenagers (15 &17) today. The three of them had never experienced an escape room before so didn't know what to expect. Tonight, they're still talking about it and look forward to going back again. We did the da Vinci room. The room was very clean, well thought-out and fun. The owner, Dan, was very personable and enthusiastic helping to make our experience even more memorable. You can tell that he loves what he does.The best part of the day was the four of us working side-by-side and figuring out the clues together. It made for a good way to end our spring break. I highly recommend this facility."

It was so much fun. They won't put you with strangers if you request it. I accidentally booked 2 different slots and they promptly notified me to check and refunded me right away. Very interesting and clever clues. Suspenseful music and fun, surprising tricks!"

They really take care to give their customers a great experience. We did the Da Vinci Room for one of my best friends' birthdays, and there were balloons there for her in the room! The clues were clever and everything fit together well. There were some fun surprises and it was a great space for us to work together. The owners are very friendly, accommodating and helpful! We can't wait to go back for the other room!"
