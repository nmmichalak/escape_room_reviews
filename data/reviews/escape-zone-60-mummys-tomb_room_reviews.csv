"Escape room ""Mummy’s Tomb"" by Escape Zone 60 in Destin",https://worldofescapes.com/destin/quests/escape-zone-60-mummys-tomb,0,"We took a party of four into the Mummy's Tomb. Clues were abundant, but challenging and we managed to locate the last clue just as time ran out. Looking for an indoor activity or something to wrap up the day before heading to dinner? This is the place!"

I've done 10+ escape rooms and felt this was pretty challenging! We had a group of 4 who have all done escape rooms before. Would definitely come back again!

Even though my group didn't escape the mummy's wrath before our time expired (we were seconds away!), it was so much fun trying to decipher the codes to get to the next clue. This is definitely on my list to do again!"

"Escape room ""Mummy’s Tomb"" by Escape Zone 60 in Destin",https://worldofescapes.com/destin/quests/escape-zone-60-mummys-tomb,4,"We visited the Mummy room for our first experience and our large group of 10 had a blast! At first, we were a bit confused and lacked direction. The use of the monitor and attendant really helped! We did not escape, also by seconds like several other groups. Thanks for making my birthday memorable!"
