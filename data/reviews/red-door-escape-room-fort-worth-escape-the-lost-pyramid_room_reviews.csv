"Escape room ""Escape The Lost Pyramid VR"" by Red Door Escape Room Dallas in Dallas-Fort Worth",https://worldofescapes.com/dallas/quests/red-door-escape-room-fort-worth-escape-the-lost-pyramid,0,"Joshua was our game master, great guy, super cool, very helpful. Couldn't recommend him more. We did the VR Pyramid Escape Room and it was by far the coolest escape room experience I've ever had, and I've done quite a few. 5 Stars, 10/10, would recommend. A+. Joshua is a bonus."
