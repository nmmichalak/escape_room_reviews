"Escape room ""Mystery Mansion"" by Breakout Games - Cincinnati in Cincinnati",https://worldofescapes.com/cincinnati/quests/breakout-games-cincinnati-mystery-mansion,0,"Mystery Mansion is the best room offered by Breakout Games Cincinnati. It is the most immersive and offers best design (in aesthetics and game flow) out of all of their other options. It has a minor creep factor, but not so much that it would ""scare"" people. It utilizes all senses and fosters individual and team solves. I highly recommend this room overall (8/10) and it way outshines the other options by this company/location (#1 of their 5 rooms). This is not my favorite company for game design or room design in Cincinnati (that goes to The Escape Game), but it is one of the best."

Our assistant was positive, encouraging, and did a great job of allowing us to do our own problem-solving. If you want a great family activity, this is the answer!"

The keys to a great escape room are providing challenge without frustration, offering puzzles that keep the entire group engaged and involved, and creating moments of inspiration and discovery that keep everyone talking after the game is over. That's precisely what we found at this location, and I'd definitely recommend it to escape room rookies and veterans alike."

The staff was wonderful. Even though we failed to escape, we had a great time. We will definitely be back to try another challenge!"

We broke out of the Mystery Mansion and had a blast. Our host was amazing, she helped us just enough so we didn't get too frustrated, but not too much that it was super easy. Next time we are taking our kids. I will also be suggesting this as team building activity at work."
