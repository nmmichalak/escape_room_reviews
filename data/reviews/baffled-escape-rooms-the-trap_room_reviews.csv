So awesome if you really want to get into character. We had the honor of having Daniel as our clue master during ""The Trap"". He was super helpful and made our experience awesome! We will be back to try out the other rooms soon."

We had a blast... We needed some helpful hints to get through. Several different thought processes were needed to make the escape and enough to ensure everyone was able to play a part in our group success. We were able to make it with 10 minutes to spare. That's 50 minutes of searching, thinking and playing through scenarios. The teen that wanted nothing to do with it ended up having a blast. We are ready for the next challenge! Thank you Vince!"

At first, the room doesn't look like there is enough going on to keep us busy for a whole hour. But as you start playing, you find out that the clues are complicated but fantastic and just the right amount of challenging.  We had a fantastic time and the staff was great.  I would definitely do it again."
