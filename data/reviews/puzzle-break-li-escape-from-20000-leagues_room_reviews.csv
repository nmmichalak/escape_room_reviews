"Escape room ""Escape from 20,000 Leagues"" by Puzzle Break Long Island in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/puzzle-break-li-escape-from-20000-leagues,0,"We had a great time at Puzzle Break. We were a group of 4 people and we chose the Escape from Twenty Thousand Leagues. It was a medium level game. Melissa was our ""guide"" and she was awesome! I would recommend having her by your side during any of the games. She was fun, patient, and super helpful. Can't wait to go wait and request Melissa to help us escape again!"

We have done a couple of other escape rooms and this definitely has more brain power involved. I think we had to solve 5 puzzles in order to find the combinations to the locks we needed to open for the final puzzle. And in order to solve the puzzles you had to find the parts, which were hidden around the room. Our in room guide helped us out a few times with some nudges, which was great, because honestly without that bit of help we wouldn't have made it out before time was up. We got out with 10 seconds to spare. It was a lot of fun and I would recommend it."

The hour whizzed by at 20k. There was plenty to do for all team members and we talked about the experience the rest of the day. Our game operator, Michael, was very good at guiding us while not letting our frustrations go too far! Maria who greeted us was very welcoming and kind. I'm looking forward to trying the other rooms"
