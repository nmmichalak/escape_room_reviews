"Escape room ""Zombie Nation"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-zombie,0,"Came here Saturday night for the first time. We did the Zombie room. We were blindfolded to walk in, so my heart rate was going a mile a minute until it came off. The room was very dark, with blacklights and glowing objects. It would have been a cool room to do. We kept looking around to see if there was a flashlight, because it was so dark and you had to see something, but we never found one.There was a CD player in the room, and it took us about 15 minutes alone to figure out how to play it in the dark without the light. I think we got pretty far without the proper tools, but I think had we had the flashlight, we would have been able to complete this. There was one task we found out about after, that, had we gotten that far, we would not have been able to even complete without the flashlight.All in all, I would say this room would have been good. Just make sure all the proper tools are given to you."

We chose the Zombie Nation. Got blindfolded and taken to a room. Even though we lost terribly, the clues were obtainable had we practiced... a thousand times. At the end, they gave us the answers and it was amazing how much thought process and psychology went into this!Will definitely come back."
