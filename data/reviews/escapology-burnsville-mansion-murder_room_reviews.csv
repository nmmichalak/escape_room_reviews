"Escape room ""Mansion Murder"" by Escapology Burnsville in Minneapolis - St. Paul",https://worldofescapes.com/minneapolis/quests/escapology-burnsville-mansion-murder,0,"Honestly, my friends and I love escape rooms! This place, is awesome! Super friendly and the game master was on the ball when you needed help. This place, we learned is also a chain with tons of different locations, so there's no wonder why they do a great job. We played mansion murder which is one of their harder rooms, and honestly it was difficult, we've never played a room before that had so many different layers to each object you had to solve. Will for sure return to play the other rooms! Oh and another benefit to this place is that you do not need to book the whole room, every game that is booked is always private. So if you only have you and one other person, the whole room is yours. Which is great, cause a lot of the time we do not wanna book an escape room if we don't have enough people for the whole room since we'd rather not play with people we do not know. This place really is top notch. And if you go on a not so busy day, they can usually give you a tour of a room if they have one available to show you!"
