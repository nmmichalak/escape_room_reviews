"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Study"" by Escape Of A Lifetime in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/escape-of-a-lifetime-da-vincis-study,0,"I went with a group of 10 teachers, and we escaped with 24 minutes to spare. The puzzles were not too difficult, and at no point were we frustrated that we weren't making any progress. We didn't even need to use our 3 clues. But the puzzles were still interesting enough. If you have 10 people be sure to call for a code to discount the price (cheaper than groupon). Would definitely do another room at this location."

The room we were in was not big enough for 10 people, it was a small room for being in a room with people you just met. It was not enjoyable since there were too many people you didnâ€™t always get to help out or hold the clues yourself. The room was not well maintained. Not pleased."

The staff was helpful when needed to.  We did the Da Vinci and it was so challenging. I would definitely come here again because the other rooms looked better. I love that they give you a fan in the room, because running around the room will make you sweat with many people in there.The only thing that was pretty shady was the non-lit parking lot. Finding the place in the dark will be hard, it's behind a building and the entrance is almost down an alley-type street."
