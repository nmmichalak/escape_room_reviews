"Escape room ""Sabotage - Black Ops"" by Method of Escape in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/breakout-fresno-sabotage-black-ops,1,I just got home from a night at Breakout and I can honestly say that I will be back! I went with a coworker and played Black Ops. Unfortunately we did not breakout but we still had a lot of fun! We were welcomed with smiles and great personalities and throughout the game enjoyed the interactions that we were given. It is a fun and mind churning experience that I can't wait to experience again!

We totally didn't expect it to be as difficult as it was but we made it out in just under 3 minutes. That 60 minutes goes by WAY too fast...hahahaha

The room I played (Sabotage) was the right mixture of entertaining, clever, and challenging. There was definitely a lot of scrambling around and yelling, but that's part of the experience.  If not impressed by the room, you'll love the staff. It's owned by a lovely couple, who are very welcoming and fun to talk to. Our gamekeeper, Brian, seemed really easy-going and did his best to help us out whenever we needed, both before the game and during. I'm definitely coming back -- I'll try not to leave Fresno in a nuclear waste next time."
