The staff was so wonderful and accommodating, even when our group was running late and needed to push our start time back. We did the kidnapping theme and barely made it out in time! Love how it was so interactive and challenging. We especially loved working with Rodney. He was there guiding us and cheering us on during the full hour and really helped us when we needed a little hint or two. Overall, such a great group activity and an even better establishment. We will be back very soon to try some of the other themes!"

We did the kidnap room and the puzzles were both tough and fun. The immersion was pretty good as well. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and did a fantastic job of explaining everything. We will definitely return to do a different room!"

We did the kidnapped room and it was soooo fun. We escaped with less than 10 minutes to spare. The gm was super friendly and nice. We had a blast solving the puzzles and riddles. It was great and I want to do more.

There were six of us who went and it was the perfect number. We had much fun and cannot wait to go again!
