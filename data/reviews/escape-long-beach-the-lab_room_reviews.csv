"Escape room ""The Lab"" by Escape Long Beach in Irvine",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/escape-long-beach-the-lab,0,Finally a local escape room! The group had a great time. Drinks before and dinner after. Great location for a cool event. Highly recommend...
"Escape room ""The Lab"" by Escape Long Beach in Irvine",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/escape-long-beach-the-lab,1,What a great addition to Long Beach! We did both the queen Mary and the lab and had a lot of fun! Jack was very helpful and it's clear a lot of thought went into the escape rooms. It's especially nice that you are able to customize the level of difficulty for each room. We did the lab at intermediate difficulty and found that to be very enjoyable. We did the queen Mary at advanced and found that to be great too as it's the easier room of the two. Definitely worth a visit!

I did not know what to expect as it was my first go at an escape room! We had so much fun! The staff were very friendly and accommodating!! They have a lounge/ party room where we were able to enjoy some wine and apps we brought while half our group tried to "" escape"" the ""Lab""... It was a great time! There were plans made to return for their ""Queen"" room, which is opening soon!!"
