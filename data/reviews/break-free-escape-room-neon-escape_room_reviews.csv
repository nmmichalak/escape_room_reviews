"Escape room ""Neon Escape"" by Break Free Escape Room in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/break-free-escape-room-neon-escape,1,Overall great room and experience! The props and clues were well done.The game master volunteered too many clues even when we had plenty of time remaining near the end. Rather than simply telling the answer we would have preferred the game master prompt us in the right direction. I would def recommend this company/room. At the beginning before you start you should discuss w the game master about how many clues you want and how direct you want them to be.
