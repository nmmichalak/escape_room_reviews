We did the Detective Office and had a blast. We solved it and were out with ten minutes to spare. Highly recommended.

I visited Escape House with my 2 teen daughters for a birthday party. The puzzles were fun and a nice mix of linear and nonlinear. The old house is cute and provides a neat environment for all 3 games. We broke out of all 3 rooms and found them all entertaining. I think we all decided the detective room was our favorite. The owner was very friendly. We will be back when rooms change in the future! Thank you for a great day!
