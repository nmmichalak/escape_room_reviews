My hubby and I used a terrific LivingSocial deal that made it very affordable. Best date night ever! We combined with two smaller groups to make one large team. We were all newbies but managed to escape with 7 minutes to spare. We loved it and will definitely be back when the next room opens."

We went with a younger group (ages 9-11) and the gentleman that worked there was awesome. When he saw the girls struggling he would give them a little hint to help them along. Definitely will be doing this again. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it, it's a unique, creative experience.Thanks for everything Escapism"
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,3,Great escape room! It was our group's first room and we all had lots of fun. We had a group of five and were able to complete the room. Overall the room was tons of fun. I would recommend this room to everyone!
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,4,"Well, how can I not give it 5 stars when we beat the room time record! This was not my first escape room, and I'd say it's right up there with my favorites. Good series of challenges that are thought-inducing and challenging, but not too impossibly hard that you just get frustrated. It's well organized and professionally run. The art gallery theme plays nicely into the challenges too. Definitely recommend."
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,5,"I've done a few of these escape/puzzle rooms, and Escapism is by far the best one.  It is challenging and fun.  You do have the option to ask for clues, which we tried not to do.  This is a great activity for a group of close friends.  I DO NOT recommend this activity for couples who are just dating. This game can get rough and a bit physical since a lot of the clue will require you to get on your knees (not a clue).  A group of 8 might be too much energy and too confusing.  A group of 4-6 is good."
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,6,"Awesome experience! Super friendly staff, all of whom were very helpful.  Our group of 8 decided to try out this escape room and were greatly pleased.  We did the Art Museum escape room, and there was a great number of puzzles for our group to solve.  There were a number of very innovative and unique puzzles, and it also had a good number of creepy, twists and turns (although nothing scary)!  I would love to explain more, but I don't want to give anything away.We had to use one hint, but we made it out with 15 minutes to spare.  Definitely looking forward to trying their next room."
