Staff was super nice, and even though our group was beyond help they still gave us an additional clue. Would recommend to everyone to try at least once, you'll be hooked."

"Escape room ""Treasure of the Seven Keys"" by Escape Room Adventures in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-room-adventures-treasure-of-the-seven-keys,2,Excellent room (Treasure of the Seven Keys). We did have a problem with one of the locks that we had to get technical assistance with but everything else was awesome. One suggestion though: review all the lock types with players before starting so we know exactly how the locks work.

It was our first time doing an escape room. My parents have gone to plenty so it was nice to have the help. We made it and we were 30 seconds from beating the record time for that room. Had a blast we will have to try the other rooms.

We did the 7 key's treasure. Quin was our host he laughed with us and made sure we enjoyed ourselves. This was our first time we went as part of my birthday celebration, and it was well worth it. We made it all the way to the last box but couldn't open it in time lol. We will be returning to try one of the other rooms."
