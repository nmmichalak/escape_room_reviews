"Escape room ""Broke, Broker, Broken"" by The Escape Artist KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/The-Escape-Artist-KC-Broker-Broke-Broken,0,"On January 16th I made a reservation to attend ""the escape artist"" at 8pm on January 18th with a bachelor party of 8. When we arrived on the 18th the lights were off, doors locked, and no one inside. When I asked the beautician next door she advised to check the board downstairs to see if ""they"" were in. We checked and the clothes pin marked EA stated they were out. Giving them the benefit of the doubt I attempted to call several times and even left a couple of voicemails and received no response. This was at the time of our reservation and 2 hours before their listed closing time. I have called everyday for the past 7 days and still haven't received a response. This company is absolutely horrible in their customer service and I wouldn't wish this treatment on anyone."

The room was challenging and fun. We went as a group of 8 with no issues of crowding or lack of tasks for anyone. I cannot wait to go try new rooms and will definitely be bringing more friends to experience the fun of Broker, Broke, Broken."

It was a perfect get together for all 6 of us lifelong friends who don't get to see each other often enough since graduating high school together almost 20 years ago. Thank you, Brian and Sullivan of The Escape Artist KC for making our day special!"

Went here on a date with the hubby, and were teamed up with 6 strangers, but it wasn't awkward, we all worked as a team and had over 12 minutes to spare.... He said that put us in the above 90 percentile.... Can't wait for a new room!"
"Escape room ""Broke, Broker, Broken"" by The Escape Artist KC in Kansas City",https://worldofescapes.com/kansas-city/quests/The-Escape-Artist-KC-Broker-Broke-Broken,7,"We just did the Broker, Broke, Broken room this evening and I have to say it was SO much fun! We have attended both of the other Escape rooms in Kansas City (Breakout KC and Escape Room) and were a bit nervous because this one is very new and didn't have too many reviews yet but it is every bit as good as the other ones! We went with a group of 8 people and found the puzzles to be very challenging and fun, the story and theming to be great, and the owner very nice! There was even a mistake in the booking and he ended up giving us a 50% discount because of it, which we really appreciated! I highly recommend this escape room!"
