I can't wait for the next room to open!  My favorite room is still the steam punk inventors room and am sad to hear it is closing soon.  You have got to try this one before it is gone!  The new alleyway room is also good and wish we had more time to finish!  next time we will get out!"

First time for everyone in the group. And we went to the CSI room. Which beside escaping, you have to solve a murder. We actually escaped, but didnâ€™t have time to solve the murder. Abby was fabulous."

The puzzles were great, some harder than others. I would definitely recommend this for groups of 6 or more as there is a lot to do. Great theme and great staff!"
