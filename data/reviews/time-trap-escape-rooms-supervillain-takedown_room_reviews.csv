I was looking for something different to do and this was perfect. There were 6 of us and we did Supervillain Takedown. It was great fun! It was challenging and more than we expected. We escaped with only 19 seconds left on the clock. We're all super excited to do another one.

We were able to complete all the tasks and make it out before the hour was up in the Supervillain Takedown room. There was so much thought put into the design and patterning of the room that truly made you apart of the action and gave you things to think about. So much laughter and communication as we all bustled around the room finding each clue. Our showman was a wonderful addition to the fun! Definitely worth the trip.
