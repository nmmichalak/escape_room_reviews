"Escape room ""Glitch"" by Escape Room Arlington in Arlington (VA)",https://worldofescapes.com/arlington-va/quests/escape-room-arlington-glitch,0,"We did the glitch room it was very fun and tricky, we had to think together and use teamwork. The staff was nice and very helpful in explaining the game. We were a family of four and even though the Glitch room was one of their hardest rooms, we were able to solve it in around 50 minutes. We will be going back again when they open their new Supervillan room."

This was our first time here and I'm already dying to come back. We did the ""Glitch"" room and it was a bit difficult at times but we were still able to escape. The staff here were so welcoming and pleasant. I would definitely recommend this to others. I can't wait to try another room!"

Highly recommend this experience. Refreshments available if you need a beverage and restrooms too. We had a great host Connor. We will go back and do the other rooms they have.
