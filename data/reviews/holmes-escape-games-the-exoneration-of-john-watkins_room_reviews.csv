"Escape room ""The Wizarding World of Wally Whimz"" by Holmes Escape Games in Houston",https://worldofescapes.com/houston/quests/holmes-escape-games-the-exoneration-of-john-watkins,0,My first escape room experience but I loved it! Our group had so much fun finding clues and putting them together. We did the Exoneration of John Watkins which was their easier room but still only had a 40% success rate. Our group made it out with 23 minutes left!

We did the Black Friday Bombing, which was difficult but the clues we got really helped us out! Each new discovery gets you significantly closer to getting out. The Holmes' are super great owners. We had the best time and are already planning our next trip back!"

This was our first escape room and the hints were helpful. The owners are very friendly and customer service was excellent. Highly recommend!
