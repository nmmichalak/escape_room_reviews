"Escape room ""The Mustache Thief"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-the-mustache-thief,2,"Excellent change of pace from the monotony of boring group activities. I personally panicked while my group kept it together, but we all had a blast and spent the following three hours talking about how we could've handled the challenges better. Too much fun, just the right level of difficulty without sitting around painfully on one task at a time. We all can't wait til next time."

Would recommend to any family. The only thing we were bummed about is one of the locks was not locked so we skipped one door. They did apologize but thought they could give us a coupon for the next time.
