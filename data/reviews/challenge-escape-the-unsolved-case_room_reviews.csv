"Escape room ""The Unsolved Case"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-the-unsolved-case,0,"I'll give them 4 stars for courtesy and a warm welcome at 1030 pm as it was a first time escape room experience for my parents. However, the FBI room was way too hard and not very enjoyable to solve. It's a disappointing feeling when you are not even halfway done at 50 min into the game."

I didn't think I would be into any activity like this, but Challenge Escape Rooms changed my mind. I came with a group of friends and we completed the unsolved mystery room. The set up was extremely well thought out, and we had to really work together as a team to figure out how to piece together the clues. We had so much fun in the process. The staff was extremely nice and helpful, and gave us clues along the way. It took us almost all the time to escape but we did it! If you're looking for a fun and unique activity to do with friends in queens, I would highly recommend this!!"

I went with a group of my friends to do the Unsolved Case room and had the best time ever. It was really hard and took us 45 minutes to get out, but we did it!! This was my first ever escape room and I can't wait to go back and chek the Virus Room out ."

I did the unsolved case room, and without mentioning any spoilers, I loved how they involved different types of technology to solve the case. I can't wait to go back and try the Virus room. So much fun! Definitely do this!"
