"Escape room ""MUTATED! A New Strain"" by Trapped Columbus in Columbus",https://worldofescapes.com/columbus/quests/Trapped-Columbus-ROCKED,0,One of the best escape rooms that I have done. Our group did the Spaced themed room and had a blast. The puzzles were quite extensive and took a lot of thinking to figure out. We made it out with 10 minutes to spare and felt quite accomplished! The staff were also super friendly and helpful and stayed in character for the course of the room. I look forward to returning sometime again in the near future!
