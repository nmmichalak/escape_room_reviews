"Escape room ""Friday the 13th"" by Escape Room Live in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/escape-room-live-friday-the-13th,0,"Overall we had fun doing the “Friday the 13th” room. Main lobby was nice to wait it, and they have lockers for jackets and phones to safely be stored in. The room itself looked amazing. The decorations were well done and we were creeped out from the start. We were told we only had 45 minutes to get out of the room, compared to a usual hour at other places. In the first section of the room, there was literally only one set of clues to work on so most of us just stood around and watched, or looked for other clues that didn’t exist. We entered the last part of the room where there were multiple clues to work on. Still seemed extremely easy and we escaped the room in about 13 minutes. Didn’t feel like we got our moneys worth out of it. They said since we set the time record for that room, we would get a 20% discount on our next room. We will see."

TJ was awesome letting us know the rules, giving us time checks, and sadly the ONE hint we needed to escape."

We had so much fun working together to figure out the clues and escape within the timeframe! This is a great activity for any group, family, work team, etc."

The difficulty level was marked as a 7/10, which was pretty accurate. With a few clues in the second room, we ESCAPED! We had a great time, but would have liked to see one more room as part of the experience. Overall, given the amount of time allotted, I would recommend this activity for anyone looking to try something challenging, fun, and new together."
