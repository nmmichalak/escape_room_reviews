Did the Mystery at Lost Point Lodge room with family and friends.Ok so we were more like a bunch of bumbling fools but we did figure out some clues on our own.   Wow Bobby and Monica were fun, friendly and professional.  Will be coming back again to try different rooms.The Ceniceros and Merlin family."
"Escape room ""Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-mystery-at-the-lost-pointe-lodge,1,"My family and I escaped the Mystery at the Lost Point Lodge. When I first walked in, the room felt very authentic, the sounds, the props made me feel like I was in a lodge. The things we had to figure out and find was fun. It was a great experience overall and I hope to go back soon to escape some of their other puzzle rooms."
"Escape room ""Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-mystery-at-the-lost-pointe-lodge,2,"We did the Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge room and rented it out just for our group. The room itself was decorated very nicely and we definitely felt instantly immersed in the story provided -- it has a maximum of six people so it's definitely the perfect size for a private room. The gentleman that greeted us and gave us the story, and took us into the room was great as well! We did have a hiccup with the game master with 8 minutes left on the clock. However, the company reached out to us the following day to apologize -- they were training new staff and things just got a little out of order for a moment. We've since returned and attempted The Secrets of the Master. Our faith was definitely restored in them due to their quick and understanding customer service, as well as our great second experience!Regardless of the hiccup, the Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge was actually our favorite room out of the two. If you're a group that's looking for a creepy room that isn't necessarily scary, it's perfect. The puzzles for both rooms are very well put together and as newbie players we didn't stand a chance to escape without clues!"
