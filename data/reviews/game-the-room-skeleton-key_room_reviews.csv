"Escape room ""Skeleton Key"" by Game the Room in Rohnert Park",https://worldofescapes.com/rohnert-park/quests/game-the-room-skeleton-key,2,"Our group of 5 had an awesome time doing the Skeleton Key room today. Three of us had done escape rooms in the past, and two were rookies. All of us had a great time and can't wait to go back and do the other room. The owners were very kind and we enjoyed talking to them prior to doing the room. We are so glad we don't have to drive all the way to San Francisco to experience an escape room."
