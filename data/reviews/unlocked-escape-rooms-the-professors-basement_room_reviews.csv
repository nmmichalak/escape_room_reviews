"Escape room ""The Professor's Basement"" by Unlocked Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/unlocked-escape-rooms-the-professors-basement,2,This place is fantastic! Our family came here and did the Professors Basement and had such a great time we came back and did the Sheriff's Office. Both rooms were so much fun for all of my family and we all contributed and haven't stopped talking about how fun it was. We are hooked on escape rooms now and Dave and the team here at UNLOCKED are great and have amazing customer service and really enjoy with they are doing here which makes it that much more fun. They gave us great hints and really kept the fun going! You really need to check this place out if is so much fun!
