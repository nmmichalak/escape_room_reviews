Each puzzle is fair and definitely requires a group effort. I had a fun time figuring each puzzle with my friends even during the more difficult puzzle. The rooms are real immersive and creative.The staff members are courteous and was open to our groups feedback. I highly recommend this activity for team building or for anyone looking for something fun and new. I'm already planning my second trip so I can try the other rooms. 5 out 5 for sure going again!"
