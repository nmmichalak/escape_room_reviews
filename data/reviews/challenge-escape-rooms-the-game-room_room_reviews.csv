"Escape room ""The Game Room"" by Challenge Escape Rooms in New York",https://worldofescapes.com/nyc/quests/challenge-escape-rooms-the-game-room,0,My husband and I have done escape rooms before so we were really excited about this place cause it was close to home. We went into the Game Room and had a good start but conundrum once we got to the third puzzle. The answers to a lot of the puzzles were way too outlandish and the last puzzle (which we got to with 15 min left) was not solvable. I enjoyed the whole game but felt very defeated even after they told us the answer to the last puzzle. It wasn't a logical answer and I felt it was something constructed to merely make people lose. However the rest of the game was awesome.

Here you only get 3 hints. I feel like 5 would be better, but what do I know. I'm a novice.We got a groupon for the Game Room, which was perfect for me because I don't like things popping up and scaring me.Would've been more fun if the people we were doing the room with didn't come drunk. I might try it again with only my friends, or just buy out the room so I don't have people messing up the fun."

They were in the Game Room and I chaperoned. My son has done close to 10 escape rooms already but it was a first for his friends. The room is family friendly, perfect for 1st timers of any age. I would definitely recommend it. I look forward to returning and trying one of their other rooms."
