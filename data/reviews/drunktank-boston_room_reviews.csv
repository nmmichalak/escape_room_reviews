"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,0,"Love love love this place. A great challenge, and not expensive at all. "
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,1,"While the puzzles are top notch and well designed (probably some of the best I've seen) execution and staff are super important with escape rooms. One puzzle had extra pieces that made it unsolvable. Markers used for puzzles were dried out and didn't work and other puzzles broke while in use and the staff did not address these broken items unless a clue was asked for if at all. Unfortunately all the staff did was say sorry but considering the cost of the room I would expect either fast reaction by the staff while in the game or something more than a ""Sorry"" afterwards. It was super disappointing for something that otherwise would be awesome."
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,2,Was new to these - very fun and extremely clever in scenario layout. A must on the to-do list of nights out with friends. Will be returning for the new rooms in the future!
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,3,The best room escape I have ever done! I have played at least 13 rooms and this one is the best! We went on my birthday and they were wonderful to me I can't wait to go back and try every game they put together (see you soon)
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,4,"So much fun! Will definitely be going to places like this again - and of course the new room that trapology is working on. However will recommend not to go in a group of 10 people, I would like to be a bigger part of all of the different parts of the game rather than being 1/10. So next time I'll go in a group of 4-6 people probably. Really awesome experience!!"
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,5,What a great experience!! We came here for a team building event and it was fantastic. We worked together and came up with some creative solutions together and felt like a team trying to escape. We can't wait to go again once the new room opens up! We were a little nervous on how all our personalities would work in this environment but it really helped us highlight our strengths and brought us together as a team. Highly recommend to anyone for any reason!

Lots of fun and it's wise to be observant.  Oh yea, we won the game too which is a source of pride when you think how many make it out in under and hour."
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,7,"You're lead into a bleak gray cell, and you can't help but feel a chill as the bars slam closed behind you.  Cold steel binds your wrists.  Strange cipherous graffiti covers the walls.  Raquel Welch mocks you from across the room.You have 60 minutes to think, act and discover your way to freedom.Can you escape Trapology?I did."
"Escape room ""The Drunk Tank"" by Trapology Boston in Boston",https://worldofescapes.com/boston/quests/drunktank-boston,8,"I really like the creativity of this place! It's also a great way to meet new people and work together really as a team. The puzzles are totally doable though my team definitely got stumped...Even if you don't escape, you'll have tons of fun. The location is a little bit hidden so be sure to leave an extra few minutes to find the right entrance."
