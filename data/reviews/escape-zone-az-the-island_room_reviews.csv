"Escape room ""The Island"" by Escape Zone in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-zone-az-the-island,2,"This room was the bomb. I went with my co-workers as a team event, so we were able to fit 16 of us comfortably in there. None of the teams made it out, but it was super close! I loved how my team was working on one clue for a hot minute and we had read the clue ""upside down"" and one of the employees told us to take a closer look to make sure we were right....they nudged us enough to understand we had read the clue wrong but never gave the answer away. I would absolutely come back- so fun and it felt exciting to be in volcano *-*"
