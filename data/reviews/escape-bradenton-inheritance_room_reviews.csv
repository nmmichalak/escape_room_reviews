"Escape room ""Inheritance"" by Escape Bradenton in Sarasota",https://worldofescapes.com/sarasota/quests/escape-bradenton-inheritance,0,Had a great time in the inheritance room. Played with 3 people. Challenging enough to be fun but not so challenging that it is frustrating and not to easy to be boring. Wasn't successful in escaping the room in the allotted time but got very close. Had a blast!

The scene was set, the props and puzzles were intriguing. We were completely absorbed in the game. This is a great team-building and family-building activity that helps you see the strengths in others. The owner custom creates the rooms, and this makes the experience really authentic. Go do it!"
