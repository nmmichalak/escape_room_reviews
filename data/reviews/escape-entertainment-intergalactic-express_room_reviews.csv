Everything from start to finish was awesome! We were completely immersed in the game! The puzzles were fun and kept us busy! No escape for us but had a great time! Will be back to try the others :) Thanks Jerry and Kristen!"

Set design was amazing and the clues were well-thought out. Will definitely be going back!"

Definitely gonna go again! We totally died in space, but we got through 70% of it with only three people, so I think we did good lol!"
