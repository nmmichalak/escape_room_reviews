"Escape room ""Nuke M"" by West Palm Beach Escape Rooms in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/the-great-escapist-escape-room-bomber,0,"This was such a GREAT TIME!! We went on a Sunday evening and had such a great time! Spoke with Randi over the phone and she directed us to the exact kind of escape room we were looking to do- being that we were a group of 6 first timers. She was so friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate us and see what we would like! We did ""The Bomb"" and it was a great time!! The room was set up so neat! It really got our minds working, even though we couldn't complete it without some help lol! We will DEFINITELY BE BACK! They have 5 rooms total! And the one we did started in a room and then we had to get a code to get into another room. It was such a good time! Can't wait to go back!! Thank you so much Mrs. Randi! You were absolutely wonderful and we can't wait to go back!"
