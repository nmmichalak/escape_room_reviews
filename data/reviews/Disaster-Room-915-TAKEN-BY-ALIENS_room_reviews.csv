We couldn't stop talking about it and how great it was. We did Taken by Aliens in 55 minutes with only 2 hints and we set a new completion record, which made our day even better! We're already talking about coming and doing the other room, Haunted Heidi, and even the other rooms that Disaster Room 915 will have in the future!Something awesome, new, and different to do in El Paso. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT"
