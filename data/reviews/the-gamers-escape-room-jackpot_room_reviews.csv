"Escape room ""Jackpot"" by The Gamers Escape Room in Temecula",https://worldofescapes.com/temecula/quests/the-gamers-escape-room-jackpot,1,"We had a team bonding experience a few months back when they had opened. The staff was family friendly. The room we had done was interactive with plenty to keep us all busy. I enjoyed the theme. We have done a lot of rooms, so this room was more basic for us. Not bad to play. Overall a fun for beginners."
