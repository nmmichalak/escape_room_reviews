Our Game Master was Emily and she was extremely helpful. I'm sure she was cracking up at us from the control room. We completed Island Escape.The only downfall of the place was the location with parking. I did not want to park in front of the building and get blocked in. Strangest parking lot I have ever seen. We ended up parking down the street a little bit and walking. Other than that, amazing experience."

It was challenging but we still managed to get out! Would definitely recommend for a small group outing for team building or just for fun. Can't wait to try out the other rooms!!

It takes a team effort of individuals with diverse backgrounds to make it out of the room.
