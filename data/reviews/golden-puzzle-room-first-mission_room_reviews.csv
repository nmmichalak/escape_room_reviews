"Escape room ""First Mission"" by Golden Puzzle Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/golden-puzzle-room-first-mission,0,"We just hosted our son's 10th birthday party at the Golden Puzzle Room. The kids were boasting that First Missions would be too easy but it took them the entire hour and they had a BLAST. Couldn't stop talking all the way home and they want to do all the other rooms! :) The support was great & we loved being able to rent the party room for dinner and to watch the puzzlers on the closed circuit tv. We will be back for more, thank you!"
"Escape room ""First Mission"" by Golden Puzzle Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/golden-puzzle-room-first-mission,1,We took our 3 grandkids (10 and 13) to the Golden Puzzle Room. They first did the First Mission Room and then we all did the Rocky Mountain Zephyr Room. We all loved the experience and had a great time. The room presented a very realistic setting I would definitely recommend it.

We did the Zephyr room and the First Mission. My kids (13 and younger) did the first mission all by themselves and loved it! The puzzles were challenging and the staff was great. Will absolutely come back for more fun.
