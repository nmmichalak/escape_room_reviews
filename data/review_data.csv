This was by far the most fun-filled day ever! There were six of us in the group and they recommended the Dinner Mystery room for us. It was so much fun that the time flew by. We can't wait to go back and try out another room. The owners are so personably and friendly. We can't say enough about them or the experience. We highly recommend for everyone to try this.

We really had a blast. This is the nicest escape room I've ever been to. We did the Dinner Party room, had a little spooky touch. Even under pressure we really couldn't stop laughing.

I was super excited and also kind of nervous. We had 3 girls in our group and made it out with about 5 minutes to spare! We did the Dinner Party room and I thought it was very well put together. It was so much fun! The clues were unique and helpful. I definitely want to come back and try the other rooms!"

The Dinner Party was our room and we can't wait to try all the rooms. Perfect for pre-dinner, post dinner, birthdays, team building, friends or ANY occasion. Love love love this place!"

It was all of our first escape room and it was absolutely amazing! I love the theme and that the employees dressed up, it was so awesome going back in time to a speakeasy.

"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-hostage,0,This was our first experience at Breakout Games in Jacksonville. Our group of 4 did The Hostage room as part of a Christmas gift.  It was nice that the rooms are private and we could experience it on our own. The whole experience was much more immersive than I would have thought.  We will definitely be returning to try out other rooms. A shout out to Isabelle for her help from start to finish with our escape room experience.
"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - Jacksonville in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/breakout-games-jacksonville-hostage,1,"We had a team building experience here with our bosses and had a blast. Half of our group did the hostage room where you go in blind folded and are handcuffed to a bench. I won't ruin the rest but that's the one I did and LOVED. Catilyn was our behind the scenes angel that watched us from another room and would would give us a clue if we were stuck but let us use our own brains and didn't give it away. SHE WAS GREAT! The other team did the island something. Sorry I forgot the name but they really enjoyed themselves as well and Daid Josh, their behind the scenes guy was really awesome. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it and can't wait to do it again!"

Definitely will be back and bringing along some friends and family!"
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,1,Did the Sherlock room and it was amazing. Fun time trying to solve all the puzzles. Super tough room with fun twists throughout. This is my 3rd Escape the room and these puzzles were harder than the other 3.

"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,4,"My friends and I decided on a whim to do an escape room one night. When we called to book a room, the staff was very friendly & accommodating. The ambience & decor were great, and the puzzles were creative yet challenging. We did the 221B room and enjoyed the twist (solving a crime instead of actually escaping the room) I would highly recommend coming here!"
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,0,This was my first experience with an escape room. We attempted the Bad Medicine room. We only got about 60% through before the clock ran out. We had lots of fun trying to figure out all of the clues. This room is very challenging!
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,1,"Every time I come to Tucson, which is often, I do a room (or two!) at Ace of Escape, they are by far my favorite in Tucson. They have a wide variety of rooms, if you catch their Christmas room during the season, it's the best Christmas themed room out there. Very well thought out, not just another room with Christmas decorations. By far my favorite is Bad Medicine, super hard, but I love a challenge! They just opened a new two person room that I can't wait to check out - I've never done a room specifically made for two people. I have a feeling it's harder than it sounds. "
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,2,We had a lot of fun figuring out all of the puzzles and were ecstatic to have escaped the Bad Medicine room!! We can't wait to come back and escape again

"Escape room ""In a Galaxy Far Away"" by Great Escape Delaware in Newark",https://worldofescapes.com/newark-de/quests/great-escape-delaware-in-a-galaxy-far-away,4,"We took my son and three of his friends today for his 8th birthday celebration and of course did the Star Wars room. Knowing how difficult the rooms can be, we warned the boys that we probably wouldn't solve the puzzle in time. But our game master Joey was amazing! They adjusted the room for the kids and he gave us an insane amount of clues anytime the boys asked or he could see we were stuck. We all know there is no way that we would have unlocked the door without all of his help. Needless to say, I have a very happy birthday boy who cannot wait to go back and try another room! Thank you Joey for an amazing adventure! We will be back!"
"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,0,"Had an amazing time last night tackling the Innocence room! Great challenge! The staff was super friendly, too! Will definitely be back to try their other rooms."
"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,1,That was the best hour ever! We opted not to prove our innocence and escape as fugitives.
"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,2,"We did the Innocence room as part of our sisterhood retreat and it was fantastic!! It was so fun and well-thought out. The room was challenging but still solvable and we had a great time doing it! Even when we were waiting to go, the employees had us playing games that were hilarious and time flew by! So creative and would highly recommend!"
"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,3,I've been here twice and both times it was a lot of fun!

"Escape room ""Innocence"" by Urban Enigmas in Athens",https://worldofescapes.com/athens/quests/urban-enigmas-innocence,4,"We did the Innocence room as a date night activity, and we were blown away by how awesome this experience was! We have done about a dozen other escape rooms, and this one is one of the best if not the best we've ever done.The puzzles were challenging enough to flex your creative problem solving and logical thinking skills, without being overly difficult. They've really succeeded in creating a fun atmosphere and story that you can jump into for an hour.We stayed to chat with the owner, AJ, for a while after we finished the room, and he was super friendly.This is absolutely worth every penny and we will be back soon to do their other rooms!"

"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,0,"This is a challenging but enjoyable room. I took my son and a bunch of his friends for his 13th birthday, which happened to be on Friday the 13th. It was just the right amount of spooky and strange to go with the theme of the day. The clues are very challenging but extremely creative and with just a tad bit more time, we probably would have solved it. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a challenging, fun, group experience."
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,1,This was the first escape room I've ever attempted but it was so fun! It is a little difficult to find but there is lots of parking. The asylum theme brought the whole room to life. (I got scared not going to lie). And the puzzles were challenging and very well thought out. I had a great experience.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,2,We had a great time at TrapZone. There were lots of good puzzles and they weren't repetitive. Most of the puzzles worked well for a group so everyone got involved. Overall a very well designed room.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,3,It was super challenging and fun. A great interactive set up! Better to go with 4-5 people than with a large group if you really want to escape.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,4,"Our whole dental team escaped the asylum with just minutes to spare!

It was great! I've played all 3 games at this company and its newest game has polished the interface and introduced a cheeky sense of humor and a cute game mechanic. Our game hosts were fantastic as well, providing appropriate hints to keep the pace of the game fun. We had a wonderful time, thanks!"
"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,0,My first escape room and it was an amazing time!

"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,1,This was the best escape room I've done!  It's pretty challenging but solvable.  We learned at the end that there are a few ways to solve some of the puzzles which was really cool.  I did this escape room with a group of friends and we had a blast and really enjoyed our night.
"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,2,"Without giving too much away, this was a very fun escape room with a great theme, but my group left a little disappointed because the last puzzle was too difficult, and required us to get several hints. We had quickly figured out WHAT we had to do, but it was so difficult, I almost believed that it wasn't the right thing to do. I've done many escape rooms, and usually the difficult part is figuring out WHAT the puzzle is, not solving the puzzle. But in general, I really liked many of the puzzles, and especially the theme."
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,0,"Great way to celebrate,  any occasion!Can't wait for the next girls night out!Have a creepy fun time trying to escape from THE ATTIC!"
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,1,"I had never done an escape room before this one, and I must say it was an excellent first experience. Two other friends and I tackled the Attic room and made it out alive just in the nick of time. One of my friends has done multiple escape rooms before so it was definitely a benefit to have someone on the team with their head in the game. The room was super creepy and dark (very on theme) and the clues were challenging but rewarding to solve. The room was extremely well decorated and believable, I felt like a part of the story and that our mission was real, but it was quite small. I think our group of three was the perfect size. We'd bump into each other sometimes with the limited space, but there were enough puzzles that all of us were working on something different at the same time. The staff were also super friendly and helpful, commending us for finishing such a challenging room. I highly recommend this place and I'm looking forward to going back to finish them all!"
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,2,"Came here for a friend's birthday and did The Attic, so fun!

"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-asylum,1,"My friends and I adventured through The Asylum! It was creepy, challenging, and probably one of the coolest team building exercises a person could go through. Samuel was very humorous and helpful on getting us started, his personality definitely kept us in better spirits on finishing the room! I will certainly be coming back to challenge another room soon!!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-asylum,2,Was our first night to go last night. Didn't pass the Asylum escape room but had tons of fun trying. The guy at the front was absolutely funny and made our visit the best! Can't wait to try the others as well!
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,0,"Dynamic Escape Rooms has come up with a great game idea. An escape room with varying degrees of challenges. You can chose medium, hard, or extreme depending on how experienced or brave you are! And apparently even if you chose one style one time, when you come back to do another style, you don't play it the same way, so it's almost like a completely different room. We chose the medium Deja Vu and it was just right for us. You don't have to be a Doctor Who fan to do this room. It just adds to the fun and the geekiness if you are. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this room. The decor is great and It was a very fun experience. Our gamemasters were Ignacio and Adam. Ignacio knew exactly when to give nudges and hints, making him one of the best gamemasters we have ever had. (Thx, Ignacio!) Also, Adam is one of the best front lobby people. He is also available on the website for a chat if you have questions. (Thx, Adam!) If you want to play a private room, you don't need to ""buy out"" the rest of the spots. You only pay $30 extra to make it yours alone! The lobby and restrooms were clean and uncluttered. This room would appeal to all ages, sci-fi fans, Doctor Who fans, puzzle fans, game fans. In other words, if you like escape games, we recommend this business to anybody and everybody, travelers and locals alike!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,1,"This was my first ‘escape room’ experience and the team at Dynamic Escape Rooms have set the bar very high. Initially I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of being locked in a room and forced to escape, but was immediately comforted by the amazing staff that assured me that this wasn’t the typical escape room. I could leave and take a break as needed, the door wasn’t locked, and to think of it as an interactive experience instead. And it was just that. I was amazed at the complexity and range of the puzzles in the room and the imaginative story line that linked the entire experience together. I first played at the medium level of the Time Machine Game, my team and I barely completed it on time, but felt we could definitely complete the hard level now that we were familiar with the layout. We couldn’t have been more wrong. I was amazed at how much more complex and different the puzzles had become with a change in levels, needles to say we did not complete the level on time. I will definitely be back and will be recommending Dynamic Escape Rooms to all of my friends. Great Job Dynamic!!!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,2,"WOW! What an amazing experience! I have been waiting for so long for a great escape room experience. I have been to escape rooms in Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix, none compared to Dynamic. The staff is professional, courteous and helpful. The room can be set at different levels, I can't wait to go back and try a harder level! I definitely recommend checking out Dynamic Escape Rooms to all looking for a fun and immersive challenge! Great job Dynamic Escape Rooms staff and creators can't wait to go back!"

"Escape room ""Dungeon VII"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-dungeon,1,"I have to say, Legends Escape Rooms must be one of my favorite yet. My friend and I were able to try out the Dungeon VII room, and it was an absolute blast! The decorations in the room were splendid and the room itself was definitely a fun challenge. The puzzles and challenges really put our group to the test, and although we did not escape, we had a great time. Well worth the price, cannot wait to come back and try again!"
"Escape room ""Dungeon VII"" by Legends Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/legends-escape-rooms-dungeon,2,"I can not say enough great things about this escape room company. When we walked in, we felt warm, and welcome -and we had a toddler with us (which personally, I do not recommend for your first time) and was immediately welcomed with opened arms. Very family friendly. We were able to escape the dungeon - the puzzles were challenging, and the detail was amazing. We were blown away. We have done over 90 rooms and that room was one of the top. We are very excited to go back and complete the others. Thanks for a great experience!"

It was a surprise. The room is actually really hard for someone like us who never played escape room before. We do have to think differently in here compare to the real world. Also alert to all of you. This room is hell scary!!! Nothing jump out. I think the guy who built this room was genius."
"Escape room ""Special Inquiry"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-special-inquiry,1,"Came here on a whim. Never did an escape room before. This place was a little tricky to find. It's upstairs of the building so head inside.Before we go into the room, we watch a screen with rules and the backstory of the escape room. Then we get a walker talkie in case they need to talk us or if we want to ask for a hint. There are cameras in the rooms for them to watch to make sure you follow the rules. We might have been reminded about some rules....We did the special inquiry escape room. Since it was the first I've ever been to it took a little bit to figure out what needed to be done in there. It was pretty fun and it did get a little creepy. We didn't make it out... but it has inspired us to try another escape room."

These are 45 minute puzzles with different themes: zombie apocalypse, pirate ship, and alien uprising. My group did the pirate ship and we got out just under the wire. From what I heard of other groups, the alien room is very difficult and neither got out. I found the pirate ship to be good for all ages as it's all on one level, the puzzles are challenging but not too much, and there isn't a ton of chemical fog. There is low light so if you have any vision problems, that could be an issue. It's appointment only, so make sure you call to reserve your room!"

This was the most fun we've had in a while. You are locked in a room with clues that you have to figure out in an hour in order to escape the room and get the picture to prove you got out in time. The clues are some common sense, some general math and problem-solving. We visited 2 other game rooms with other companies and this one is by far the best. I am so glad they opened up in Montgomery. They are also located in a great side of town!!"

"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,0,"Fyi to set expectations, my friends and I have done several dozen escape rooms. Not sure experts but not new to the scene either. We loved the puzzles. They were refreshing compared to some of the overused ones we've seen. They did an EXCELLENT job with the startup tech theme. Lots of jokes that techies are sure to love. But if you're not from the startup world, you'll still be able to enjoy the puzzles and story without feeling lost. Great for group sizes 5-8. The first few puzzles are a little linear to get everyone warmed up, but the following ones can be parallelized so everyone's working on something and not feeling bottlenecked. Definitely would recommend!"

We have done all of their rooms, most recently doing their Big Top Circus. Their circus room is amazing! Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this room. It is now in my top five favorite rooms (we've done 121 total so far to give you a comparison). It is very aesthetically-pleasing and the puzzles are very clever, well-themed and challenging. All of their other rooms are very well done, too. One thing that sets North Valley apart from some other local escape room places is their employees. They are personable, fun, helpful and have a genuine passion for escape rooms and talking to others that do as well. Their clue system is very fluent and doesn't lead you in the wrong direction and they are quick to deliver them when needed. We love North Valley and can't wait for their next room to open because they never disappoint. There is a lot of heart that goes into their rooms and it definitely shows. Keep up the great work and keep wowing us with whatever comes next."

It was really thought out and well done and lots of riddles, puzzles and locks, but it was linear so we couldn't work on different puzzles/riddles individually. We had to ask for quite a few clues since some of them were a bit difficult. There were multiple rooms and it was fun seeing each themed room. I can't wait to try The Great Outdoors next time!"

We did the Project Iceworm room which I would highly recommend. The room is dimly lit and you have to search around with flashlights for clues. We thought the puzzles were really creative and challenging. Since it was just the two of us and both of our first times we didn't make it out in time but we still had so much fun. The couple running the place are also super nice and create the rooms themselves, which is super neat. Can't wait to go again!"
"Escape room ""Project Iceworm"" by 21 Keys Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/21-keys-escape-rooms-project-iceworm,1,"I'd never been to an escape room before and wasn't sure what to expect but we were blown away by 21 Keys. I expected something cheesy (think like murder mystery dinners) but this was so well thought out and executed that I'm still thinking about it 3 days later.I booked the Project Iceworm room for me, my mom, and my sister and we ended up having the room to ourselves (probably not peak hours for this type of activity). This was the most difficult room, which I knew and we were warned about again before entering, but we're puzzle/game people so we wanted something challenging. The room allows a max of 6 players and I was worried about not having enough people for it since we only had 3 but unless we had someone experienced with escape rooms I don't think additional bodies/brains would have made it any better. The story was not only entertaining but so well translated into a game and the time (and money) that they had to put into the design and technology of the room is evident and impressive.We ended up asking for three clues and were impressed with how they were delivered. I expected to just get direction via an intercom or even to have someone walk in and guide us but the clues were integrated into the design of the room and were gently guidance, not just ""do this next"" which made having to get a clue less disappointing.We didn't solve the room but were told we made it about 75% of the way through. Honestly, solving it would have been nice but the hour of entertainment (which FLEW by) was worth what we paid and more. If we weren't so hungry I would have asked if we could stay and do the Speakeasy room which looked very cool, too.btw, there are lockers for your jackets, purses, etc so you don't have to deal with those while you're in the room which was a nice touch."
"Escape room ""Project Iceworm"" by 21 Keys Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/21-keys-escape-rooms-project-iceworm,2,"This place is incredible. It is fairly new and the woman who runs the place is so nice and you can tell she really cares about what she's made here. We did the Project Iceworm room which was technologically incredible and honestly so well put together it was astounding...by far the best escape room experience myself and my group have collectively ever had. We were so into this room that we followed it up immediately after with another room called The Speakeasy. Though less challenging overall, still very well thought out and definitely would be a great first introduction to escape rooms. Please consider coming here, I promise you will not regret it. A+"

"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,0,"We tried the game titled ""The Lost Expedition"" which was rated medium-hard as far as it's level of difficulty. Without giving anything away, we'll say that it's a lot different than what you're used to, and has a lot of parts to solving which will make your team think outside the box, communicate well, but this particular Escape Room had a particularly good ""flow"" as you progress through the room. We will say that the actual room used for the puzzle, are well thought out, Jason was a great host, and we all agree that this Escape Room is one of our Top 5 favorites we've ever tried. Not because we solved it, but because it was VERY fun to do! Have you ever done an Escape Room where it's a lock defeating puzzle and all you managed to do was open 15+ locks? Well, this Escape Room is far from that, and was really really interesting. Give Steal and Escape a try! We think you'll like their games A LOT! Steal and Escape's experiences cost $32/person, but we also think it was time very well spent in our humble opinion."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,1,"So I actually ran The Lost Expedition as my first escape room ever on December 19, and while I thought I had done a bunch of research ahead of time on how escape rooms work and what to expect, this room subverted my expectations and set up a tough standard for future rooms I would do.Everything in the room is user-activated (really heavy arduino use), and one of the mechanics of the room actually gives the players more agency in their experience. There are no traditional padlocks or number pads. There is a critical path for the players to follow, but non-linear encounters line that path. Certain players have roles defined in the context of the game that provide a natural kick to encourage participation and communication, and I feel like that's really clever and probably doesn't get enough credit.Jason is a great game master and clearly has the experience to know when and how to nudge versus hint, and crafted an experience for our group that felt appropriately challenging, but never frustrating. My first experience with an escape room just happened to be this one, and it was so great that I was motivated to visit a different facility on the same night. The only bummer here is that so much heart and soul has to go into the creation of each room that I don't want to come back too soon, because once I play Mysterious Stranger I'm going to have to wait until the next room is released."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,2,"My group and I completed The Lost Expedition and HIGHLY recommend this company and room! For my birthday my group and I decided to do an escape room crawl in San Diego and this was our first stop. Not only is this room very immersive, the staff is also extremely nice.We originally were supposed to have four people playing this room, but plans changed and could only do it with three. Instead of turning us away and saying that we couldn't do the room, the two gentlemen working just came in at one point to help us with the one puzzle that required four people. Without giving too much away, the room begins with everyone being assigned a role that will help you in completing the room. I really liked this idea because it ensures that everyone gets to be involved in the room, instead of just have a few players steamroll everyone else. The team elements that are required to escape really add to the experience in my opinion.The other major difference with this room is that it isn't your traditional 60 minute room. It's all dependent on the choices you make throughout the game how long it will last. Your time could end in 20 minutes, or it can end in two hours. We will definitely be back next time we're in San Diego to do their other room, and can't wait to see what this company has in store for the future!"

Game master was also super friendly and super helpful.Me and 3 other friends did the seven deadly sins room and it was very well done. Theme and decorations were great and the storyline continues throughout the entire room. We weren't able to finish the room in time but the game master was nice enough to take us through the rest of the room. Also if you're easily scared you should be fine to do the room, I'm a chicken and I found the only thing that really scared me was the smoke machine turning on.Just keep in mind that if you decide to do this room it's fairly difficult, 3/4 people in our group have done escape rooms in the past and we needed a lot of help. Also the rooms are fairly tiny, so I recommend keeping your group to about 4 or less people."

"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,1,We booked our Escape Room experience this afternoon; we chose Alice's Dream. We had so much fun! I love the setup in each room - super cute! Totally Alice in Wonderland theme. We find the puzzles & riddles challenging. You don't have to know anything about Alice in Wonderland to solve the puzzles. Christina was super nice & friendly;she gave us clues to help us move along & not get stuck.  She said she does not penalize us if we ask for help; what matters is we have fun. We would come back here again & try out other escape rooms. And their restrooms are super clean which is important to me & what I always like in a business.
"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,2,I brought my family here for my parents' and little sister's first time doing an escape room and we all had an incredible time! I was always worried my parents might get frustrated or not really understand what's going on but Alice's Dream is really family friendly and great for all levels. Barry and his wife did such an amazing job into the production of the escape room - it really felt like we were in Alice's dream from Alice in Wonderland! I will say that nothing is actually frightening but I did scream multiple times when things would open up but that's just me being me LOL I would 100% recommend this place to everyone!

We have played around 20 escape rooms now and this was by far the best lock-and-key style room we have ever played (& probably my 2nd favorite game we've ever played!). We are typically more attracted to rooms with more technology and effects but the puzzles, decor, and INCREDIBLE ATTENTION TO DETAIL made for an incredible experience. The decor and props made for a fantastic, immersive experience! We were bummed that we didn't have time to play the other rooms, but when we're in town again we will be sure to return!"
"Escape room ""Encore"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-encore,1,Great escape experience!

"Escape room ""Encore"" by The Escape Effect in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-escape-effect-encore,2,The Escape Effect was an excellent escape room experience and this is a recommendation coming from my family and I who are enthusiasts that have completed over 30 escape rooms. The theme and decor of the room we did (Encore) was well-designed and the puzzles were a lot of fun. The establishment is clean and the staff are kind. It is a locally owned mom and pop shop and the quality shows.The Escape Effect can adjust the challenge level of your room if so desired and they offer unlimited hints or none at all...basically they'll do whatever you want/need to ensure you have a great time.

If you're going to do this one... don't overthink!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock's Library - Destination London"" by ALL IN Adventures Lawrenceville in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/all-in-adventures-lawrenceville-sherlocks-library-destination-london,1,"Just did the Sherlock room at Mystery Rooms. It was a really fun and unique experience. I have never done anything quite like this. You choose a room (each one has a theme) and you have 45 minutes to solve the puzzle inside. There are various clues hidden through out the room and you and your other detectives work together to solve the case. As a mystery nerd, I absolutely loved this, but I think your average Joe would too! The owner was incredibly nice & attentive. If you find yourself at Discover Mills, definitely stop by. It's an affordable, fun, and unique way to pas some time with your friends. The only complaint I have is that the room was really hot. It could have been the fact that you are in a small room with a few other people with the door closed, but other than that, this place was great!"

A perfect and fun thing to do when you want something more original than a movie.  We loved the sherlock room and the royals room.  Clues can be tricky...on your first room you might want a clue if you are stuck.   But put on your thinking caps and give it a try.    Good luck!

Similarly, a number of the items in the room are in disrepair, misspellings are crossed out and corrected- which kind of takes you out of the moment, one of the UV lights we were given was basically useless because of how dim the light was...In summary, a well designed, challenging room, but not as professional of a company as say Omescape."

Two players are equipped with power shields that can block attacks and also be thrown like a boomerang, and laser pistols. The other 4 players carry laser rifles that also have a flamethrower... Theme is alien invasion... If your teammate gets damaged too much they shut down and you have to tap their shoulder to heal them and they can rejoin the battle.  If alien eggs are allowed to spawn they may jump on you and start biting your chest and your teammate needs to shoot them to get them off, but you can kick the eggs to break them or hit them with the flame throwers... A fun team tactic: give the kids the shield to block, and adult stands behind them with a rifle to shoot overtop of the shield! :)"

He had a great time. We did Amber Sky and my son loved the experience. I would say this is bit pricy. I could have taken kids to Great America all day for the same price. This was a 30 minute long game so I hope they would lower the price to attract more people.

This was our 1st ever escape room experience and it did not disappoint. When we arrived we were greated by Grace (who was also our game master for the room) and asked to sign the typical ""dont sue us waiver"" . Once that was handled there was a short safety video and away we went. We were lead to our room and presented with a short introduction video which set the theme for the room and the game. After that the clock started and the game was on! I wont spoil anything but we barely made it out...it was super fun. A very good mix of brain teasers and puzzles and red herrings. Once we completed our adventure we were walked out to the photo area to discuss the room and take our victory photo! We will absolutely be returning again soon to try a different room :)"

TMER was amazing on the phone (we called within two hours of closing) and directed us to make an easy reservation on their website. I've done two escape rooms at two other businesses and the Dino escape room was truly outstanding. The puzzles were harder (and a little more temperamental) than some of the other rooms I've done in the past but we made it with a just a couple minutes to spare! A good game master can make or break an escape room, and we were lucky that our game master was following closely and was clued into some of the minor difficulties we were having and was able to help us out when we needed and asked for it.We did Dino with three people (one of whom had a little too much to drink at dinner and possibly made it a little harder at times ) and it was challenging. Go with friends ... I'd say your best bet is to do this room with 4-6 people!"

The theme and story of room were spot on and immersive. No random items that feel out of place like directional locks or number locks. There room is challenging in a fun and clever way.

The immersive aspect of the room was really amped up having to talk to our fortune teller.If you've been here before, you'll know that this is the same space that was used as the Disrupted Decades room but they've done a phenomenal job making the room its own experience that I couldn't tell at all what the room was before.Great job Level Games team!"

The fortune teller herself is more of a mediator than a medium. She will guide you through the narrative and provide some hints along the way.The room has great atmosphere. It is like an old penny arcade that has a variety of delightful challenges requiring problem and puzzle solving, dexterity, and creativity. Teamwork was encouraged and rewarded by our live Zoltar.We had a group of 3 and found that there was plenty for each person to do. They recommend 4 people for this max of 5 room. As the cards are dealt, the game design definitely benefits a group of 4.I can see great success for this room and continued success for Level Games in the future.

This escape room was AMAZING. When we arrived, we were welcomed by one of the owners who was amazing and so, so friendly. He took the time to talk to me for a good 15 minutes after we escaped and I have tons of respect for an owner that will stop and talk to their customers. If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I really would. Highly, HIGHLY recommended. I did the ""Sarah's got a secret"" room with a friend and was blown away by how well put together and thrilling it was. I have been to numerous other escape businesses in the past all over South Florida and very few can even compare to the room I did here. If you are seeking an extraordinary, adrenaline filled, and unique bonding experience that is not just your run of the mill outing then you really need to get over there to 'Try N Escape'!!!"

I'm disappointed to have to go to any other places knowing that this is my new standard. The rooms are designed down to the T. Everything makes sense while still being super challenging and surprising. The owner is the funniest and nicest guy ever. We were so pumped by last night's Sara's Got a Secret (which the description, though amazing, STILL doesn't do the room justice) that we're booking the other room tonight. The owner knows what he's doing and has been to enough escape rooms that he explained ""this isn't like other escape rooms"" before shutting the door on us. Beyond incredible. I would recommend Sara's Got a Secret to anyone who can handle some creepy plot lines, some scares (nothing too bad but be on guard), and a real challenge with my group's time to beat!"

So show up early, have a drink, grab some food. We had a variety of apps and some beer. Ok then we did Under Pressure. This is one of their hardest rooms and we didn't make it out; bring a strong team if you're going to get this one. We have been to several different companies around town and this was one of the best. Two things we really appreciated the most:The room/tasks were well built and clean. There is nothing worse than a run-down room with crapped out locks or letters that have been rubbed off. This room had very good locks and tasks. So you knew that when a lock wasn't opening it was your fault, not just a bad product. Also, the tasks were very creative. Some more than others but we really liked a handful of the tasks. They were hard but still felt solvable. Sometimes you finish a room and realize you NEVER would have solved that. That's disappointing. This place didn't feel like that. The puzzles were certainly tough but with good communication and thinking we're all very doable. Overall this was a high-quality place with well thought out tasks. And they even have beer and food too! Thanks!"

Most of us were still recuperating from the night before when we arrived at 330 PM but that didn't stop us from taking on the hardest room there. We chose ""Under Pressure"" which was a submarine themed Room. I thought the staff did a great job of explaining things  and the room was designed in a cool way. I hesitate to explain further because I would hate to give anything away for future players. The game was super engaging and really fun! We didn't escape :( but we were on the last puzzle so that's something? Also! They were doing a cross promotion with the Denver Museum of Nature & Science and we found four free tickets in one of our clue boxes. That was an unexpected, yet really great surprise!"

We were told the room has a 9% success rate. We finished it we 10 minutes left on the clock. The initial puzzles were fairly easy, but became more complicated towards the end. This room was really engaging, and had a good story to go along with it. The one thing I didn't like was that you simply ""escape"" out the same door you come in, which was physically unlocked the whole time in case some needed to get out for an emergency. Overall it was a good experience, and I would definitely go back."

The room itself was decorated very nicely and we definitely felt instantly immersed in the story provided -- it has a maximum of six people so it's definitely the perfect size for a private room. The gentleman that greeted us and gave us the story, and took us into the room was great as well! We did have a hiccup with the game master with 8 minutes left on the clock. However, the company reached out to us the following day to apologize -- they were training new staff and things just got a little out of order for a moment. We've since returned and attempted The Secrets of the Master. Our faith was definitely restored in them due to their quick and understanding customer service, as well as our great second experience!Regardless of the hiccup, the Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge was actually our favorite room out of the two. If you're a group that's looking for a creepy room that isn't necessarily scary, it's perfect. The puzzles for both rooms are very well put together and as newbie players we didn't stand a chance to escape without clues!"

"Escape room ""Kingdom of Cats"" by Omescape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/Omescape-Room-Escape-SF-KINGDOM-OF-CATS,1," My boyfriend and I came here with our friends and we had a great time! My boyfriend booked the Cat Kingdom in advance which accommodates 6 people and is the least difficult out of all their rooms. The people at the front desk were very nice and helpful as well to get us started.The process starts with everyone watching a video and getting a backstory about the room you enter and also the staff provides you guidelines so you can narrow down your search when looking for clues to help stay within the 1 hr time limit. Cat Kingdom is a great starter for anyone new to escape rooms as this one still gave us quite a bit of difficulty. The room is well designed and you really have to look at everything as a whole.Overall, we're definitely planning on coming back again to experience the rest of the rooms as we had lots of fun. We managed to escape just 1 minute before the time limit so hopefully for our next experience we will finish a bit faster."

My youngest who will soon be 8 wasn't engaged for the full time, but he was captivated exploring the room for more than half of the experience, so I'd call that a win. "

I've done about 15-20 escape rooms total at this point and it solidly lands in the middle in terms of enjoyment. We escaped with a little over 10 minutes left.The setup was pretty cool but I felt that the puzzles were a little rudimentary and seemingly a little random at times. They also did not really tie together all that well in my honest opinion. We also had quite a few components of the room that were broken when we went which further detracted from the quality of the experience. All in all, I still enjoyed the room, but I don't feel that it is as good as other reviews would lead you to think it is."

"Escape room ""Blind Tiger"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/blind-tiger-sf,4,"My second time ever doing an Escape room and I would say EscapeSF is AMAZING! Hands down. The location doesn't stick out too much but you can't really miss it on Kearny! You can take public transportation or even drive and park at that underground parking lot of the play ground if you'd like.I got a LivingSocial deal and thought, why not! $80 is a steal. Especially since the weekend evening price was $139 or something. But hence the fact when you purchase the deal that they have restricting days for certain pricing! Following the instructions of booking your reservation is super easy, but I was a little confused if Antique room was the only option for booking or if the link provided to book had Antique's page as default trying to book a time with EscapeSF. So we ended up doing the Antique room and LOVED IT! Though my friends (3 others) and I didn't succeed, I had tons of fun!The main reason why I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a few times where my friends and I had no idea what triggered us to solving some of the puzzles... Sometimes they would just happen. I guess I'm just comparing my first experience of doing an escape room and they had where you had to unlock a bunch of stuff so I was expecting that but nonetheless, this concept was SICK. P.S.: Tiffany and Allison were awesome employees! Getting us started and answered our questions in the end. AND they're coming out with a third room - Blind Tiger - coming out in August!!!

"Escape room ""The Painter's Collection"" by Eludesions Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/eludesions-escape-rooms-the-painters-collection,0,"So, I did not escape this room :(. However, despite my failure I have to rate this 5/5 because it was phenomenal. This is the hardest room they have and by FAR the hardest room I've ever done. I truly felt that I lost this room fairly and squarely (and I don't say this often lol). Before starting this room, you have a choice of picking it in difficult mode and of course being with fellow avid players, they chose the HARDEST MODE. That was our first mistake. I probably wouldn't pick the hard mode unless you had at least 5 people all of whom have done 20-30+ rooms. This was a true v4 room with little to no keys/locks. Lots of puzzles to solve and definitely a lot of puzzles that I have NEVER SEEN and was WOW'd once clue master explained it to us. This room put lots of different skills to the test and made us quickly realize our weaknesses. I highly recommend this room!"

"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,0,"This was an awesome escape room!  Very well done, no red herrings, and an appropriate amount of encouragement from the Game Master (Dillion).  The puzzles were great and plentiful.  The room was very professional and functioned as designed.  There were no cheesy puzzles or tricks that were stupid, as sometimes happen.  Just a Grade-A experience.  And no, we didn't solve it by the time limit, but they let us continue, and we got out about 10 minutes later.  The first escape room we didn't complete, but probably still the most fun and most challenging.  Also, the room was well-lite, so you can see without straining.  I've been in escape rooms where you can't read the combination locks because it was so dark...very frustrating...but that didn't happen here. You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.  A word of caution...don't leave anything in your vehicle while you do the escape room.  Our van was broken into and we lost some stuff.  It was our fault, we had been told earlier in the week in San Francisco not to leave anything visible in your vehicle, or they will smash and grab...and it happened to us.  Live and learn.  Good luck!"

"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,5,"I'm a big fan of San Francisco history (and turn-of-the-century history in general). Located in the old Exploratorium building at the Palace of Fine Arts, where currently housed is the wonderful Innovation Hangar exhibition of old Panama-Pacific International Expo historic items, you'll find the Palace Games' Great Houdini Escape Room. This is the same room that Houdini presented to his notable friends 100 years prior. With a team of friends, you'll use your wits and teamworking skills to solve your way out of the room. It's challenging and very, very fun. Not sure when the Houdini room ends, but from what they've told us, we can expect a spy-themed room coming in the future.Highly recommended!"

"Escape room ""The Great Houdini Escape Room"" by Palace Games in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/great-houdini,7,"The Houdini Escape Room is by far the best escape room I have done. The puzzles were all well thought out and much more creative than the standard combo-lock puzzles I've seen in the other rooms. The puzzles are challenging, but all of them made sense and there no crazy leaps that you had to make to solve it. The room itself is well put together with an underlying theme that pulls everything together and enhances the experience. The only downside of the Houdini Escape Room is that I fear that no other escape room will ever live up to this new standard.I definitely recommend the Houdini Escape Room as it is not only extremely fun and challenging, it is also the best escape room out there."

We didn’t even complete the room, but we still had an unbelievable time! It was like being on the set of an action movie!

Everyone played a crucial role in solving the puzzle.Tip for advanced players: This is a good challenge to do without any hints and about 4 players.Tip for beginners: They give 5 hints maximum, so use them wisely.

I might also add that we escaped both times! We didn't need any hints in the Roosevelt Room and we still managed to escape in 72 minutes. One thing that was exceptional about our run in the Roosevelt Room was our host, Alan. He was funny and very helpful. If you are into escape rooms, I would definitely check out Palace Games.

Better yet, they truly feel as if they are organic and belong in their environments.  What sets Lockdown apart from other escape rooms is their commitment and attention to a particular aesthetic.  They have realized that challenge does not have to detract from the overall immersion of a room escape experience.  Their design principles are a welcome change from the many rooms where escaping the zombie apocalypse, a fallout shelter, or an alien research facility requires the unlocking of a half dozen bike locks.Lockdown is a challenging, affordable, and engaging option for a group room escape.

The overall theme was really cool for Savannah and the good news is that we escaped - but only with like 3 minutes remaining (and we only had to use one small hint)! It was a lot of fun and the escape was a perfect balance of being difficult, but not impossible. We were placed with another random group because there was only two of us, but it was kind of fun being forced to work with strangers. This was one of the highlights of our trip! Thanks!!"

Initially we were supposed to play Da Vinci, but when we arrived the game masters warned us that it has about a 10% escape rate. Wish we would have known that before we booked! (The website just lists it as ""hard"" so we had no idea). We were nervous since we've done a couple dozen rooms but didn't feel like we were ""experts"" in any sense, so game master Jess suggested we play Red Alert instead and we were so glad she did. The room was a perfect mix of physical puzzles, lock and key, and technology, and we never felt stressed or stuck. Jess was awesome with giving the right amount of hint without just telling you how to solve the puzzle, and we escaped with a few minutes to spare. We also talked to her for a while afterwards and got some recommendations for more 60out rooms to play. Can't wait to try them out next time I'm in LA!!"

Temple's production design is the clear highlight. Scenic elements, lighting, sound, and electronic effects combine to create the immersive experience of exploring a pre-Columbian complex of chambers. The mission is straightforward: find the treasure before your ex-partner does. The objective is more mercenary than the typical tomb adventure but it leads to a fun ""payoff."" Puzzles include logic and translation challenges presented with thoughtful design, interesting props, and technological flair. Puzzle difficulty ranged quite a bit, and I could imagine solvers of all levels of experience finding ways to contribute. Temple is among the best escapes I've played in Colorado!"

"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-island-escape,2,"We went to the Island Escape room. They had a really fun theme and room design and a lot of new and novel puzzles that were well engineered. The staff was friendly, engaging and on top of monitoring our progress. The communication was clear and easy to understand.Cons:Some of the puzzles were huge leaps of logic. One of the first ones took us about 15 minutes to figure out and we had to use one of our three clues. A few tweaks on it would have made it much more understandable. After we won, the room leader came in and told us that a lot of people get caught up on it. If that's the case, then it's probably the puzzle that needs fixing. I don't like the feeling of being stuck on the first puzzle! I wish they had given me a few more wins before a big stall.This experience puts this room at the middle of the pack of my escape room experiences, but I do hope they continue to refine the puzzles because the room could be great!"

I've done a few other rooms, but nothing like this one. We put on our pith helmets and escaped the space ship into the tomb only to discover we had to keep going back into the space ship. All of the rooms work together, and you have to split your group into small teams and work on the puzzles, and just keep building on puzzles until the very end. We were overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere created by this room. It was incredible with Hollywood style special effects, but I don't want to give too much away. You feel like you're in a tomb!! After we escaped, we had to all hang around and check out the technology in this room. It's mind-blowing to see how this whole thing works together.

We did the room where we had to find the sword.  That room was challenging but fun!  Our group loved it.  We were sooooooo close, that we even got bonus time!  Sadly, we still didn't get out.  In any case, it really brought our team together, and we are looking to come back soon to experience Area 51 =)"

The games were fun, the party room was great and the staff was fantastic! For this age group, I would suggest the Witches of Salem, though they really enjoyed ""the Sword of Hattori Hanzo"" very much as well, they just needed a bit more time to complete it.  We will soon be back to try the ""Inside Area 51"".  Did I already mention the staff? :)  They were amazing, friendly, caring and on top of everything.  I highly recommend it!"

The theme is a ghost pirate ship, and the decorations are some of the best I've seen for an escape room, and really make you feel like you could be on a ship. You can tell the owners spent considerable time and effort to build a great immersive experience. In terms of the puzzles, I won't give anything away but they are logical and are well-intergrated with the room elements. My group ended up getting stuck on one puzzle for too long (due to not figuring out the wording properly on one clue), and just barely escaped on time."
"Escape room ""Escape from Myth Room"" by San Jose Room Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/myst-escape-room-ghost-ship,1,This was our first escape room experience.

We did the Study Room and it did not disappoint. We definitely needed to use my sister for quite a few puzzles but between all us, we only needed one clue and we escaped - I think that's a win! At the end of the room, the theme definitely came full circle so I appreciated the attention to the detail and I would highly recommend this to anyone.However, it doesn't beat my favorite room of all time which is the Great Houdini Escape Room which is actually in San Francisco, so if you're ever in SF you definitely need to go there!"

So I had written a review about how expensive it was and the manager responded saying they NEVER charge $75 a person. The picture I have clearly shows 2 people for $141, I guess it's not $75 but still close. They then had written to me and discussed why it was that expensive. Mind you I'm a paying customer. I had already bought the experience even though it was expensive, I had found a cheaper option. However, they did not care if I paid or not. They just kept saying bring more people and it's cheaper per person. Okay, so bring you more money makes it cheaper, I guess that makes sense.I asked if a refund was possible, they said no all sales are final.So I ask if I can add two more people and to charge my card. They respond saying you booked the room and it fits 7 people, when I get there I can pay for the rest. I said ok. And was just waiting till the day of the experience. Couple days go by and all of a sudden I get an email saying I'm being denied service for my malicious intent. All I did was point out how expensive it was.So I asked for a refund and they say they can't and DEMANDED to have my address to send me a check. There's a couple things wrong with this:1. Were in the 21st century, we've figured out how to refund people's credit cards.2. Asking for my address to send a check? That sounds fishy. Almost like they want to avoid the refund in the system to not look bad.I did not want to provide my address to a business that has taken a paying customers money and has now refused the service. So they said too bad. If you want, there's a check here waiting for you or you can cancel through your bank.Doesn't seem like good customer service to me.I had asked why she was being so unprofessional and she just kept saying I was a liability.I'm a liability for writing a review based off there pricing.As funny and as ridiculous as this story may seem, it's true. I honestly couldn't believe the service received as a paying customer. I knew the prices were high but still took decided to pay it to surprise my girlfriend for her birthday. And instead of the manager thinking of changing my mind and providing a great experience to change my review down the road about price, I'm harassed and denied entry. That's the last time I ever spend a penny at this place. Now I have to dispute through my bank this ridiculous charge because they refuse to refund me the normal way."

We've played numerous rooms across the country and were looking for a great one in the area. Sprightly Escapes didn't fail us! We played Mission Improbable and gave our best attempt at stopping an evil time traveler from rewriting history. Our entire group was impressed with the immersive feel of this particular escape room - we often feel like that's missing in other rooms. Clues and puzzles were also aligned to the story which we really appreciated. This kept us immersed in the experience and it kept us on our toes throughout the entire hour! Definitely recommend checking this escape room out if you're looking for something fun to do in the Denver area.

"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,0,"Best price point for a ninety minute game anywhere!  $29 bucks!? Comeon, I pay that much and more for shorter sixty minute games.Overall I give it five stars across the board, quality of puzzles, difficulty level, theming, quality of the props and decorations.  And the briefing they give is spot on, the lore of their backstory is so cool, mostly because it has a lot to do with actual history.  Of course I love time travel to start with, but Escapeopolis actually pulls it off and makes it seem authentic."

Hardest puzzles our group have ever been challenged with, yet excitingly delicious at the same time.

This is a hidden, and soon to be a not so hidden treasure in NWA!!  My husband and I and another couple tried out Escapeopolis and Basinga! we found our new favorite escape room game!!First, the puzzles are phenomenal, all very crafty and unique - especially compared to other escape rooms that seem to depend on way too many padlocks.  My hubby loved it!!!  You really gotta think, you know, use the old brain pan to figure these puzzles out.And the look and feel of this place is awesome!  From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were thrown back in time to some military laboratory where top secret stuff went on.  The look and feel continued from the front door into the game and all the way out the door!!  Very nice.We played their newest escape room, the insurgent attack, where we were sent on a mission as security agents to 1969 to... oops no spoilers here folks - lol!We didn't win initially, but we played again later in the day when they had another time for us to book and killed it.Don't forget to book early for this one, they were pretty busy when we went.

It was their first game ever, and I’m afraid we completely spoiled them! This game was by far the best game we ever played! The level of immersion from the time we walked in to the time we escaped the room was the best we’d ever seen! Plus, the way the puzzles were set up made sense, like we were in a real place and not a game!

So here’s my review for that room as well.The insurgent attack was nothing like the 1959 game, but boy, was it cool! The story is kicked up a notch and the special effects are super cool too! The game is also 90 minutes, unlike the 60 minute 1959 room. The puzzle were harder than the 1959 room, but they’re still solveable, thanks to the extra 30 minutes. My friends and I didn’t escape, but we’ll definitely be back next weekend to beat this game too! We found our newest favorite escape room today!"

The story of the game was not only in the game, but also through the rest of the building as well!Once we were in the game, we had to change our normal strategy since there was only one padlock in the entire room! Crazy, I know!We escaped with just seconds left on the clock, but, boy, was it ever so exciting!Definitely give this room a try! My friends and I had such a good time, that we immediately booked the newest room, the insurgent attack, for after lunch!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,7,Unfortunately this was the absolute worst escape room I have ever done. Which is unfortunate because the couple that run it obviously put a lot of time into it. My wife and I have done 20+ escape rooms in several different states across the country and this one was BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE and BY FAR THE WORST! We brought 2 friends that had never done an escape room and I am so sorry that was their first experience. We paid $140 to do their newest room having something to do with time travel. Sadly after having spent over 2 and a half hours there total I still can't even properly explain the room. He talked FOREVER before we even were allowed in. Even though I had asked repeatedly to go to the bathroom. Then serval of there props didn't work. The flashlight we needed to get into the second room wouldn't turn on. The intro video was excessively long. They entire thing was WAY TO COMPLICATED! The clues he gives you aren't even real clues and they were off center so we couldn't even see all of it on the screen. I was so upset with how ridiculous everything was that we told him we were done even before our time ran out. We just wanted to go home. He offered to let us come back for free to do this room again since so much of equipment didnt work correctly but he should have offered us half our money back. I will NEVER go back and I will be sure that none of my friends go either. If you want a fantastic escape room experience go to Bolt NWA! The only reason we tried escapeopolis is because we had done all the other escape rooms in NWA.

At a normal escape room you are greeted at the door and led to the room where you solve various puzzles to escape. Escapeopolis is much different than a normal escape room. From the moment you are greeted at the door you feel like you are already immersed in an elaborate storyline. You are led to a room full of intricate details and thought provoking challenges, which truly test your puzzle solving capabilities.

We split into two groups and tackled two different rooms. My group was able to escape the Museum Heist room.The game master was very friendly and clearly explained how the game works.

"Escape room ""Escape the Air Raid"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-air-raid,2,"This was my first time doing a room escape and it was a lot of fun. We did the Escape the Air Raid room and it was set up in a WWII theme. A lot of attention to detail is evident in how the room and the clues/puzzles are set. I like that hints are available if you're stuck.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the maximum number of people who can be in the room is ten. We were a party of four, so there were six other people in the room with us. One girl in particular was very obnoxious. She kept trying to control everything and would interrupt others when she thought they weren't doing something right. But she was wrong most of the time, which wasted precious time for everyone else.With a smaller group (say six or eight at the most), I think that everyone could be involved more and it would be enjoyable for everyone."

"Escape room ""Spy Chambers"" by The Clue Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/the-clue-room-spy-chamber-1,0,"This was our third time visiting the clue room since they opened a few years ago. Their rooms and puzzles never fail to provide us with laughs and provoke thought. Truly well designed experiences. Other live escape rooms tend to have condescending staff members, but this one is quite the exception! The owners are very nice and helpful and always have been. This time, they had a new employee who was kind, helpful, and addded even more to an already outstanding business. Well done, Clue Room, well done!"

The room was sufficiently challenging but solvable especially if you utilize the 3 hints wisely!Brian is a really nice person who showed us around.

I had a plan set in motion to help my friend celebrate his 300th Escape Room and they helped me store the cake and balloons in their party room until after we exited the room. They even decorated the room by writing Happy 300th on their wall. For the room itself, we did The Menagerie. When I tell you that we had a blast, it doesn't even begin to describe it. The room was so well designed and there were lots of things to do for the 8 people in the room. I usually don't like larger groups in general for a room but this was a special occasion and it did NOT disappoint for one minute. We were thoroughly entertained throughout its entirety. I can't wait to see what else Level Games has in store because this room was great! Thank you again for the amazing hospitality!"

My girlfriend is such a scaredy-cat and screamed multiple times at inanimate stationary object, which made it that much more exciting. We also played the Doggy Dog and Disrupted Decades rooms in the past and left with big smiles. All REALLY well done and super fun. Will be back if they release new stuff."

It is a great experience developed by the creative minds and hands of the designers and owners of Arcane and Escape Chronicles.  All the puzzles and set pieces demonstrate the skilled craftsmanship of Arcane's wooden and mechanical wonders coupled with the originality and innovative puzzle flow that is a hallmark of Escape Chronicles.  This room was more of a cabinet of curiosities than a menagerie, with beautiful and intricate showcases that are interesting to look at and challenging to fully comprehend. There are some thrilling and unsettling moments provided by good production, sound and light effects, and most importantly a sense of timing and pacing that a certain evil genius would be proud of.

This is a great team-building, critical thinking, and fun experience - even if we didn't make it out in time from one of the rooms. The owners will be changing the rooms/clues every few months which will allow people to go back for repeat visits to try a new challenge.

"Escape room ""Headless Horse Man"" by Pikes Peak Escape Rooms in Colorado Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/colorado-springs/quests/pikes-peak-escape-rooms-headless-horse-man,0,"I did this one a little over a year ago now.  I’ve done 14 different escape rooms, and to be honest this is easily my least favorite one.  The decorations felt low budget, the hint system was terrible, and it realistically was just one puzzle.  I took my in-laws to it, it was their first escape room.  I insisted the next time they visited we do another room so they would get a better impression of escape rooms in general."

"Escape room ""Spellbound Supper"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-spellbound-supper,0,"We had such an awesome experience playing ""Spellbound Supper"" last night. Shoutout to our most excellent game master JONATHAN for being just the best. Very pleasant, welcoming, and how he conducted himself as the host/maître d' from start to finish really made this a top-notch gaming experience for our group.The game itself was very innovative to me. Not sure how they pull it off, but I definitely felt we got our money's worth. For me, personally, Real Escape games have felt very challenging and near-impossible. SS was actually quite solvable -- thanks to Jonathan's gracious assists. We just didn't make it in time, but again, I felt we got our money's worth and got to experience something innovative and fun we'll be talking about for a long, long time.Minus one star for the condition of the game objects. The projector could have been stronger, brighter, sharper, I suppose. And did not project precisely on the plates. And some of the game objects (like felt and colored masking tape) were coming off whatever the objects they're supposed to be sticking to. Other than that, it was a great evening for all!"

But important thing is we had a great time to solve the mysteries! What a fun activity I recently discovered.I thought nice mixture of modern and classic.At the beginning we had no clue what we had to do. But A kind butler who serve the supper was assist us really nicely:giving us hints. I impressed that they have a real person(actor) to assist and lead the game,wasn't only automated computer system. I thought it was expensive activity when I purchased it, but after the game I felt great,I'm glad I came!! I can see this game works for building teamwork skills and own brain stretch. I should bring my boss and coworkers to here. I even became a fun of puzzles because of them. I would love to try other games they have!! highly recommended!"

It was quite challenging and we needed a lot of help on some of the challenges, but the staff was great and we got so, so, SO (darned) close to solving the puzzle. Alas. Without giving anything away, this was unlike any escape room any of us have ever done, so it was a fun new challenge for us. Every moment counted. Even though we weren't successful, it was a fab way to spend an afternoon followed by sushi and ice cream treats in the mall across the street for dinner. The kids even thought it was cool to hang out with their parents all day. Win win!!"

For those looking for a small-group challenge, play Inventor's Secret. Larger groups will want to play Burned Out. I particularly enjoyed the mini-escape room that they offered in their lobby.

It's very tech related and the puzzles aren't like the other puzzles in other rooms. You have to really think what you would have to do in that situation. Also, the simulations are really cool. You feel that you are truly going under water, because the capsule moves slightly to give you that feel. If you are very claustrophobic I'd advise against this room, as the space is kind of small. Not extremely small, spacious enough for 2 people to move around, but not a lot. Very fun maze room. Highly recommend."

"Escape room ""The Abyss"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-the-abyss,2,"I attempted this room with my boyfriend recently when we found out that this opened because we had been wanting to do a room with just us 2 to see how much better we have gotten at escape rooms. This room was immersive, but that's every maze room escape room. It was pretty linear, considering how the room was only designed for 2 people to play. The only issue I had with this room was that there were a few technical issues with the room, such as things opening when they shouldn't, and other parts not working properly. I imagine they probably fixed it now, but those were some issues we had when we were playing this room. We still managed to escape with a few minutes to spare, although I imagine we would have escaped much quicker if we didn't have all those technical difficulties that threw us off. "

This is strictly puzzles and solving riddles. Party in Vegas was so much FUN!!! It was a nice pace of change compared to other serious rooms. The decor was great and highly immersive. But I would say it's one of the easier escape rooms. We only had three people and escaped in 53 mins.

We've played escape games in at least five major cities and after having played 'Heist, Gold Rush, and Spec Ops' these are some of the best!! The sheer ingenuity of each room is astounding! We were challenged in ways we'd never before seen in a room. If you're seriously considering taking up the escape room challenge, do yourself and a favor and book here!

"Escape room ""Gold Rush"" by The Escape Game Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/the-escape-game-atlanta-gold-rush,2,"Best. Ever. I've tried several escape rooms in the past. I found that most of them don't make much sense to follow especially in the beginning. You have to be some sort of psychic to get started. This one is clean, logical but also with varying difficulty. It's clean, well organized with great instructions. The people working there are friendly and the scape room is fun! We did the gold rush escape room however there's many more to choose from. They vary in difficulty and next time we're gonna try the hardest one. If you get out in time you can buy a prepaid card for 15% off the next visit! After trying a couple of escape rooms in other locations I was weary of trying this one but they definitely change my mind to how much fun escape rooms can be and I will be going back for sure! I think you should definitely check this place out, it's located near the SunTrust braves stadium. There's tons of places to eat there there's also tons of other fun stuff to do there including shopping. It has a great night see you in the area and I think there's parking available but it's paid. The price per person at the escape room is fairly decent around 35 bucks. Some of the rooms start later like around 1130/11:45 PM and they open around 8am (they rooms run through out the day!) I was impressed and had a great time!"

We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted and felt welcomed and comfortable. Great lounge area overlooking the Battery while you wait. I wasn't sure what to expect, because each game is unique and everyone's experience is different. I'm not gonna lie, it was not easy. But CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! We had 3 teams of 8. Our room was the Gold Rush. I won't give anything away. I will tell you our room host was Richard and he was really helpful to us first timers. You have an hour to escape the room. I was worried about claustrophobia for some but it wasn't like that at all. Plenty of room. You are given a few clues which are helpful. Adrenaline rush was fantastic! Everyone had a unique contribution to help us solve our way through. Logic, math and common sense. And we did it with over a minute to spare! You get a sticker proving you did it and if you want, you can buy merchandise to further brag about your brilliance. You HAVE to try it. I will go back, for sure!

The decorations were well done and we were creeped out from the start. We were told we only had 45 minutes to get out of the room, compared to a usual hour at other places. In the first section of the room, there was literally only one set of clues to work on so most of us just stood around and watched, or looked for other clues that didn’t exist. We entered the last part of the room where there were multiple clues to work on. Still seemed extremely easy and we escaped the room in about 13 minutes. Didn’t feel like we got our moneys worth out of it. They said since we set the time record for that room, we would get a 20% discount on our next room. We will see."

The whole production of the room was really cool, and the room was non-linear so one thing necessarily didn't lead to another. We came late at night so parking wasn't an issue.

My friend and I joined another group of six and they came really late so our game master let us start early and they even offered to step in if a puzzle required more than 2 people which was really nice of them! Eventually our team eventually did show up so we didn't end up needing any help.We did the paranormal room and the production value was great! But it is very dark and you're only lit by the flashlights you're given so be prepared for that. Though it is creepy, it isn't too scary so besides from the occasional loud noise, you shouldn't be expecting any jump scares. And also you get unlimited hints, so that's great, our game master was very helpful and we definitely made use of those hints. Some puzzle do require things to be just right when you do them so that did lead to a bit of confusion in different parts. But other than that it was great and a lot of creepy fun! We got out with just a minute to spare!"

"Escape room ""The Millionaire's Loft"" by Escape House Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-house-mesa-the-millionaires-loft,0,We had such a great time doing the millionaires loft here!  We have done escape rooms in multiple cities around the US and this was one of the best!  The staff made us feel so welcome and made sure we had a great time!  The room was very unique and challenging and we were able to finish it with only a minute to spare. We used a couple hints and they were well thought out giving just enough to point us in the right direction but not just giving away free information. I recommend this place to anyone that enjoys an hour of great family friendly fun!  We will definitely be back to try the other rooms!

We escaped with 38 seconds left. We had such fun, we signed up for ""The Detective's Office"" immediately afterward. We can't wait to do ""Flood the City"". I would say that this business is a ""must-do"" escape room experience for newbies and experienced pros alike. If you like puzzles, you will like Escape House Mesa."

Avoid if you have escape room connoisseurs. 5/5 for room design - it sets the mood for a break in. 1/5 puzzle difficulty - most of the puzzles were ultra easy to figure out. I could be that I'm a little more experienced and should have opted for a more challenging room. (We were out in less than 20 minutes, so understandably, I didn't feel like we received our money's worth). "
"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,1,Nice backstory and immersive room. A mix of modern and unique traditional puzzles that fit the theme nicely. Good room for newbies. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the booking process. The game master was tracking our progress carefully and gave hints promptly.
"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,2,Escaped the Theft room with my family on 5-14-17 (with 3 seconds to spare).

"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,5,We had a great time doing the Thief room but got stuck a few times. We did end up figuring it out in the end and beating the time but only with a lot of help. Overall it was a great experience but the North Valley Escape Room in Anthem is so far the best we've been too.

The manager, Marian, who was also our gamemaster, was super nice and welcoming. We did the Pipe Works, which turned out to be a good, solid escape room. This room could be divided into 2 teams racing against each other, or as we did it, one team. This was a fun room, run by a fun staff. Marian was a great gamemaster, and she knew exactly when we needed nudges and help. (Thx, Marian!) We highly recommend this location to beginners and experienced gamers alike."

The rooms have great production quality, a wide variety of clues, and are interactive so the whole group can participate and enjoy. The theming is great and the staff is friendly and helpful. The zombie room was harder than the bunker, so I'd suggest starting with the bunker or asking the staff which room to book if you haven't played before. They're very helpful and will help you find a room that's a good fit for your group."

We were able to escape but the puzzles were definitely challenging and keep you on your toes.The tech in this room was fantastic and seamless, anytime something would be completed or unlocked the transitions were seamless and very well designed.Our game master, Anthony, did a fantastic job setting the stage and environment for the room.

My friend and I made it 1/2 way through the last room before the we ran out of time. (We did the Swiss Original room).

A little frustrating but the puzzles were great.

Upon arrival, we were very happily greeted by Zoe and her partner in crime. They gave us the full disclosure and all of the info we needed to fully enter the room we were going to escape from. We had an hour like most folks and that was just enough time for the 6 of us to find our way through the various puzzles (with several hints from the awesome duo up front).

The owner was very helpful with clues to guide us without giving too much away. It was the best escape room I've been to in the Tampa Bay Area thus far.

"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by Big Escape Rooms in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/big-escape-rooms-outbreak,10,"We did the Outbreak Room and solved it with a few minutes to spare. We lost a few minutes to a broken lock, but they were helpful when that happened. The room is the best I have seen- lots of real clues and not red herrings. I would not suggest this for your first experience, though. First-timers are overwhelmed by the pace and the complexity of the concept, so doing this room will be frustrating for some. I would also suggest getting a Groupon or other discount, as it can get expensive to do escape rooms without when you have a group of people. Lastly, we had 10 people- our group of 6 and 4 strangers. That was too many. I think a group of 6 would have been perfect. You simply can't strategize or communicate the way you need to when you can't hear or come up with a plan for who does what because of chaos. Overall, I would highly recommend this for experienced escape room fanatics and teams who work well together and can delegate."

"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,2,"Very rarely do I leave reviews for places, but my experience here last weekend absolutely justifies one. I had a chance to try to escape the Cold War Bunker, and quite simply it was one of the most fun things I have ever done. The staff are incredibly friendly, the rooms are built and themed like mini soundstages, and the puzzles are genuinely difficult, but not impossible. It all adds to an awesome hour of puzzle solving and team building. I paid $33 to spend an hour frustrated and failing, and I can't wait to go back for more. If you derive any sort of joy from problem solving and working a riddle over and over until you finally solve it, you NEED to check this place out.RoomEscape LA, I will be back."
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,3,"My group did both rooms, and BOTH are so perfect. The exact level of difficulty and ingenuity that you want in an escape room.We liked the bunker more -- escaped with ten minutes to go. It was impeccably decorated and had a good mix of logic and physical challenges. The bank was also so fun -- the flashlights were a good touch, and this room had a great multi-section layout. Escaped with ZERO seconds left on the clock!! Challenging but not undoable!"
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,4,"I've never tried anything like this. I'm not the least bit into video games but this was one of the coolest experience I've had in recent weeks. Just go with an open mind and be ready to think. My team did the cold war bunker. Allegedly, that's the easier of the two rooms, but we certainly found it challenging! One hour went by way too fast! The cool thing about doing this, is that for one hour you are completely immersed in what's going on around you. No phone or outside distraction competing for your attention. I thought of nothing but the task at hand the entire time we were locked in there and it was a very nice change of pace. The crew there is fabulous! Jo is so sweet and gave a nice little pep talk before you enter the bunker. Listen to what she says - she gives a few helpful hints that you're likely to forget once the action starts. I had a slight problem signing up online but she was more than helpful and took care of everything right away. Looking forward to going back and trying the bank vault!"
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,5,"I've watched a lot of James Bond movies, and I've always asked myself ""I wonder if I can do what he does"" - Now I know I can.I got together with a group of friends and did the Bunker. It was one of the best exhibitions of teamwork I had ever seen. We each had different positions, 1 person was a scribe, another would organize clues and process them, another would focus on the puzzles, one person was the leader making executive decisions, another person was constantly scouting the room for things others missed or things that changed in the room etc. We all had a lot of fun, and each person contributed something that helped us get to the next level, it wasn't just 1 person solving everything. Believe me when I say, every single position matters. Irene was a great host. (I think that was her name). She had a great sense of humor, and even joked with us when we we're doing something wrong. As the last 10 minutes hit the clock things got intense with the last puzzle. Finally we solved it, and saved the world! You're welcome."

After booking the room, we realized it was also the most difficult, but we decided we were up for the challenge.  The staff here was also great!  Since we were newbies, he spent some time letting us know how it works and then went on to tell us the back story of our game. We were to discover the clues to unlock our door and to save the city from being flooded.  We were allowed 3 hints during our hour game, which we did use.  There were five of us and the game was definitely difficult but we escaped with only minutes to spare.  So much fun and we can't wait to return and try the other rooms!"

We love them; we came here and played The Theater room, which was fun, and a little challenging. We recently came back to do OutBreak, which we knew was the hardest room, but this room is specifically meant as a money grab room, which I have played a few rooms like this, elsewhere; before! What I mean by that is the room is designed so you don't make it out, and they take your $100 bucks that is costed you to book it! There is a difference between challenging and just making it so hard that you spend the whole time on one set of puzzles starting at screens which hurt your eyes! I thought the concept of the room was awesome but the way the room was laid out, game wise was not good at all! This room in my opinion needs to be reworked; I will not becoming back here again, and I will not be doing another escape room in general, for a long time as this room left me with a very bad, and annoyed feeling, of being taken advantage of money wise! I can no longer recommend this place to anyone that I know or that asks me!"

Our game host Nick, and Game Master Ferd did an excellent job of helping us keep the game moving along. We were always engaged and working towards our next clue. Definitely worth the price."

"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,1,"We did the Camelot room. It was fun and very cleverly done. We ran out of time butt it was our first time. We didn’t realize that some steps had multiple steps. We were trying not to use hints. We finally used one... we got to the last step. I will say that it would have been better to say...10 steps, and spend less than 6 minutes per step. That budgeting would have helped...then, if we got stuck after 4 minutes, then use a hint. So, we want to go back and try that logic next time."
"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,2,"We tried the Camelot Room on a recent Friday evening (along with my youngest son’s college roommate). We called and reserved the room in advance.The 2 staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. After paying and signing waivers, we were shown a short video explaining the “Do’s & Dont’s” and how to use the iPad.They have lockers where you store your cell phones (& other items if you choose), as they do not allow phones in the rooms.This escape room does not use interactive game masters that we were used to. Instead, your hints are delivered by scanning QR codes around the room with the iPad. When you use the hints, it deducts from your time. There is also a bell in the room that you can ring at any time to have a game master come in and help if needed.We found the Camelot room to be challenging, but not to the point that it was frustrating. It wasn’t easy, but it also wasn’t so hard that it was unsolvable. The theme, layout, and props were all thought out very well.Without using any hints, we did escape with a couple of minutes to spare. Although I must admit, had it not been for our kids, my wife and I probably would’ve struggled a little more to make it out in time.After you escape, they take a group photo, which they post to their Facebook page.Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely try one of the other rooms next time!The only negative thing I can say (and it’s not that big of a deal) is that their sign and parking area were not very well lit and we actually passed the place when we first drove by."

My husband and I have probably done 25+ escape rooms both in the Bay and in other states and countries. (You would think we're really good at them, but no we just enjoy them .) We did the Mystery Room and didn't escape in time (got out in just over an hour). The host was really attentive (he wasn't in the room, but I guess from the monitors he could tell when we were struggling) and asked if we wanted clues at just the right times. He was super nice and friendly too and is why I give this place five stars instead of the four I would probably give just for the room itself.Storyline and theme was just okay, but it was still an overall good time. Would recommend this for a fun little date, the room is doable by two people."

We were unsuccessful at that place so we were determined to try and escape to one in SF. We tried the Alcatraz room and finished with 18 min left on the clock. Not going to spoil this with hints but all I can tell you is everyone needs to work together and also separately so you have adequate time to complete this. Its part physical and the rest mental. Most of the clues are right in front of you so don't sweat it and overthink too much. Think and act like a prisoner ;)"

As you may already know, you get locked in a themed room for an hour and you have to try and escape by overcoming a number of different physical and mental challenges. It's an experience like no other. My entire group had a really great time and we are looking forward to experiencing the Insane Asylum.  They like to have 6 people per session so if your party is less then 6 you may get paired up with people you don't know. They also don't serve food or alcohol so get your drink on before you come."

It really challenges your logic skills and forces you to exercise teamwork - LOVED IT!Parking can get pretty challenging.  Luckily, we reserved a later time slot so parking wasn't bad, but, I would suggest arriving early, to lock up a parking spot.Susie was a great hostess!  My team (Team Adobo) and I only needed ONE hint to escape and Susie was on the other end of the walkie-talkie ready to help us without giving away too much.

It turns out that it was the best experience! The fact that we didn't know each other was irrelevant because we were able to escape with seven minutes left. Molly's Horror Room was definitely a challenge and may not be suitable for younger children as it has a few jump scares. Ovi was our game master and was great with setting us up and providing us with gentle nudges when we weren't quite on the right track. Overall, I would definitely do it again!"

The clues were all working, they were clever and tough, and the decorations were on point. We escaped in 61 minutes and used 3 clues. You get an unlimited number of clues, but we tried to do as much of the room as we could without hints. They take your photo at the end and airdrop it to you right then and there (again high tech!).

The only thing I will say is that I think the last puzzle with the rotating numbers is a bit too difficult and not sure anyone would get that without a clue. We had to get clues several times and I doubt anyone has ever done it in time without using clues.My advice: don't waste too much time not getting a clue if you really need one."

I'm not sure what you're supposed to say about these kinds of things without giving much away, but if you choose to spend your time in this escape room you'll find it well worth it.Rather your average run-of-the-mill employee, those who work in this fine establishment role play the game perfectly and you will sincerely feel like you are in a high-stress, real-life situation rather than just a game.The puzzles were incredibly unique and nothing I had seen before, despite having done several escape games. If you're expecting to play an escape room game with a bunch of locks that ask for word or number combinations, be warned. Your brain will be stretched to the max in this game."

We did Helter Skelter with 8 people ranging in age from 17 to 48. The theme was done well, the puzzles were clever and the game flowed well from clue to clue.  I think 6-8 people is good for this room, and I would say it is about Medium in difficulty. The host Ashley was extremely accommodating, I cannot say enough how pleased I am that she moved us to a different room that would work better for our group.  Nick was the game master, his clues were good maybe a bit too easy even, but he was extremely attentive, he could tell we were lost down a wild goose chase and nudged us along. Which keeps it fun. I will definitely be booking again for one of their many other rooms! Note: if you book Black Site, there are only 4 of you in the room together, if you have more than 4 you will not get to play together, which was why we moved our group of 8 to Helter Skelter."

A great way to spend time with friends or family and you will learn how they handle problem solving.
"Escape room ""Scorched"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-scorched,1,"Our group of 4 did the 'scorched' room and we were absolutely blown away! Other escape rooms we had done before didn't even come close! I won't give away spoilers- but the entire atmosphere of this room was just top notch. You go through so many different areas, it is decorated perfectly, and they even have music/temperature/scents/extras to set the mood! I (unfortunately) typically find escape rooms to be too expensive, but with how much detail (both set up and during the game) went into this room, I feel it was appropriate. GO TO THIS ESCAPE ROOM! Challenging & oh man, we couldn't stop talking about how cool the experience was."

We only had four people in the room working on solving the puzzles so it was super challenging. We ended up not escaping in time but were told it was a hard room and it's best done with 8 people. What a cool concept. Clues were hidden in places you never would have looked or places you did look and just past right over them. It was quite the adventure. We solved all the puzzles but one before time ran out. We are hooked and want to do more. A great way to spend a few hours with friends. I would definitely recommend.

"Escape room ""House in the Woods"" by Pacifica Escape Zone in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/pacifica-escape-zone-house-in-the-woods,1,"We visited Pacific Escape back in April. It was a long drive for us to Pacifica, CA but it was a nice & scenic one near the coastline. There’s plenty of parking outside of Pacifica Escape Zone. When you pull into the complex, you might not be able to see the name Pacifica Escape Zone as it’s named as their parent company “Anime Imports”.In addition to Pacifica Escape Zone, the owner also owns a comic book store in the near vicinity so if you are a comic book fan, make sure you check it out! As we entered the lobby area, there’s really no check in or décor which we thought this could be improved to give the player the whole experience. Today, we are trying their newest room called “House in the Woods”. They currently offer two rooms total with ""Murder Scene"" being the first. In ""House in the Woods"", you are playing in the dark for the majority of the time which makes it quite challenging. If you like escape rooms with locks, this is the one for you! Since there is a lot to do in this room for just two people, we were 95% in and didn't escape in time. Pacifica Escape Zone is trying to acquire another space within same complex to create another room! We can't wait to see what they have planned for their future!"

It's been about 6 months since I last played a room. But I've done about 40 now in total. Both games were wonderful. Some seriously genius puzzles that fit the theme and made sense to be there, especially in the witch game. Their other game, The Last Supper, was the amazing! I'd consider it a a thriller/horror game. But the unexpected and best part to me was that I have never laughed so much while playing an escape room. Or maybe in the last few months of my life lol. They set up moments to make us laugh, or for us to make ourselves laugh. The actor was great, the story flowed perfectly. As well as continuously throughout, constantly developing to immerse us further and further. Timing of the puzzles allowed us to finish with only a few minutes to spare. My biggest wish is I want to get amnesia so I can just forget it and play it over and over haha. Thanks for the great evening!"

We did the witch's cauldron a few weeks ago and loved it! We were told another scary room was opening soon so we decided to come back and give it a try! The last supper was the BEST room I've done so far. The actors are amazing and there is the right amount of scare to keep you on the edge of your seat (you'll know what I mean) but not soo much where you can't solve the puzzles. Definitely recommend 100%!!!

It's a fairly low tech room (mostly just spin locks, and keys). The hint system was through walkie talkie and the GM was very attentive and helpful when we were stuck on some of the puzzles. There are no red herrings in this room, which is very useful so that you don't get stuck on something that isn't part of the game. Only negative thing is that there is no countdown in the room so you either have to ask, or just remember the time you started and time yourself on the clock. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We ended up parking outside in the metered parking. I believe it was $1.50 for 1 hour. We will be back for the other 2 rooms."

I love that nothing in these rooms feels like a huge leap. Even when you get stuck and get a clue, you immediately go ""Oh! How did I not get that?!"" It's also great that in a small room, they have multiple things you can be solving or working on at once so that everyone is always occupied. And this time we got magic tricks AND we got to play with a dog in the lobby. Seriously, the staff here is the best. Definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back and do Bonnie and Clyde!"

Our game keeper was great, kept the game going, let us know when we were totally off on a wrong direction. We had a teen and a child with us, and I they had an awesome time too (make sure to check the policy on bringing kids under 15). Everyone was able to be involved and it was a fun time. And luckily we escaped the Madame Lumina Room!! Would definitely love to do this again!"

We played with a group of six, which seemed about right for the Madame Lumina room-- any more, it may have been a bit too chaotic for me anyway. But with six players, there seemed to be enough to do to keep us busy and keep the excitement building in the room. The game maker/runner did a good job at keeping us moving along and not letting us get stuck in futile searches. Overall great time!"

We were a party of 5 and did the Uncooked game.  Person who checked us in explained everything clearly and answered all our questions.  At the end of game she went over how we did and explained some of the puzzles where were stuck on - eye opener!  lol  Everyone enjoyed themselves and would definitely go back and do it again.  Uncooked game was different from other escape room game types which was a nice surprise and change.  Instead of trying to beat the clock to get out of a room, you're fighting the clock to try to make as many recipes/dishes as possible - nice twist.  Good for all ages."

"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Escape Room 5280 in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-5280-jacksonville-sherlock,0,"This place was one of the best escape rooms I had ever visit! At first, we were sketched out by the area (downtown Jax) and the safety of the room, but the game master assured us about our safety (not to mention that there was an emergency code to escape). A group of us reserved the Sherlock Game and enjoyed the challenge! We were left with 5 minutes left when we escaped and every one of us had a blast. I am most likely coming back and recommending this to everyone I know!"
"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Escape Room 5280 in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-5280-jacksonville-sherlock,1,"We have done many, many escape rooms all over the southeast, and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in the Sherlock room. All the puzzles made logical sense and fit well with the story. While the technology and scenery were fairly simple, there was a variety of hands-on puzzles beyond just finding 4 digit codes and keys. Sometimes escape rooms use fancy scenery to mask flawed game design and puzzles. This place is the exact opposite. The puzzles and game are the stars of the show. The old house located in the downtown area adds an intriguing twist that you won't find at your traditional strip mall escape rooms. We had to walk up the stairs to the second floor to get to the room. There are certainly flashier (and more expensive) escape rooms in the Jacksonville area. But if you want a fun and unique experience with solid puzzles and minimal distractions, I highly recommend giving this place a try. The owner was awesome as well. He took plenty of time to talk to us about our experience and definitely made us feel like welcomed guests."
"Escape room ""Sherlock"" by Escape Room 5280 in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-5280-jacksonville-sherlock,2,"We did the sherlock room and really enjoyed it. The puzzles were logical and made sense. They were difficult but I didnt get frustrated like I had in some escape rooms before. This particular room was low tech, but really worked out better that way. Less distractions so I felt happier working the puzzles. The owner was very helpful and friendly. The outside of the building was under construction, so it didn't look like a business but the address was correct."

We are looking forward to doing another one soon. Also, our ""stage manager"" (the room's host) helped make the experience fun.

"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,3,"My group of 4 absolutely loved Sabotage! It was somewhat linear while also leaving a lot of room for exploration of codes. The theme was awesome being smashed into a train car with everyone. It gave a real sense of urgency without having to do much to affect us mentally. There were enough red herrings to keep us going down a rabbit hole or two without overwhelming us with useless items and meaningless clues. It's so hard to gush about the room without giving away hints, but I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find something to dislike about Sabotage! Go try it!"
"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,4,"Sabotage is an excellent room fun, challenging puzzles.

Knocked out the ""Missing Scientist"" in about 45 mins. We had a group of 4 with only 2 of us ever doing an escape room before, and Mel explained everything really well for the couple of people who had never done an escape room. We needed a couple of hints at first because we stalled in the first room, looking for clues in the wrong places. But I think that's good because then once we got on a roll, we all kind of knew what to look for and did a good job of dividing tasks up between us. Solid first time, will definitely be back to do the ""Facility"" room soon."

Don't miss the opportunity to play Back Alleys Escape rooms. The owners Simon and Angie are helpful and so fun to interact with. It's a family run business with such a fun vibe. The two rooms that they have are very challenging and well thought out. I think they make there own rooms. A ton of detail and fun is packed into each room. The Hut was challenging but we got out in time with the help of our game master. The Basement was a 9/10 in level hardest. We could not get though it. We are doing it again and hope to escape the next time. We have played 20 escape rooms to date and consider this to be one of the most challenging. Highly recommend you play here. Also the have VR escape rooms. And they are fun as well. We enjoyed both of them and will go back again just to play. One last bonus is the laxer tag room. My children enjoyed themselves and it's a great idea to take the whole family for a afternoon of fun or even a birthday party.

The theming was great. We really felt like we were in a bar. The puzzles were well designed. There was enough to do with our group size of five. We have done over 50 rooms and this room still had some puzzle that made us work, think, and wrack our brains for the solution! That is the mark of a nicely designed escape room! Great for 4-6 players. On the down side, the hint system used a tablet for receiving texts. Players should have their hands free. There are little red stickers on items “not to be interacted with.” -- mostly items on the walls. This just takes away from the immersion experience and these items should be propery secured in place. This is lazy room construction. I hope the company fixes these issues for their new rooms."

Some of the puzzles were innovative and had some cool technology involved, but the final puzzle was a bit simple and made the ending a little anticlimactic.

"Escape room ""The Lost Jungle Safari"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-the-lost-jungle-safari,1,"For my second escape room experience, I brought three 13 and 14 year old boys that I babysit. The four of us took on the jungle room and we all had a blast solving the clues. We did escape but the boys also took full advantage of the use of the walkie talkie and asking for hints whenever they got stuck for more than a couple of minutes. The hints were helpful, though, and we were able to quickly move on to the next task with a little nudge. I thought that the dim lighting in the jungle room provided an extra challenge as it made things a little more hidden and harder to see. There was a good mixture of easy to more difficult steps to solving the puzzles and I love how these rooms force you to communicate and work as a team. I'd definitely love to come back and try other rooms in the future."
"Escape room ""The Lost Jungle Safari"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-the-lost-jungle-safari,2,Omg so much fun! The gal that was assisting was awesome! This was my first time here and didn't know what to expect. She left us in the room with one clue. From there you look for the clue that she gives you and then you find another clue with one of the clues that you just found. We were in The Jungle Room and we had to find the gold skull. We did it under the our time but there were a few glitches that held us up due to someone putting a lock on backwards so there was no way we could ever get the lock opened to get another clue to move on to the next phase. She came in and helped us and figured out what was wrong and then gave us a free clue. You're allowed three Clues if you get stuck within the hour to help you move on. It was fun all of us got along and we did a lot of laughing. Looking forward to going back again.

Edward gave us a warm greeting and a thorough explanation of everything we needed to know before entering the game. The puzzles are difficult and we were able to keep all 14 players busy. I got to meet the owners, Greg and Shannon while I was there and they told me their newest game will be ready soon. I cannot WAIT!

We ended up finishing with 30 something minutes left and the guy was generous enough to reset the remaining 2 rows of puzzles (normally done with large groups) so that we could do the rest of them. I really enjoyed this room as it was full of all sorts of different puzzles from logic, to word, and everything in between. They really make use of every possible type of puzzle as no two are alike.

"Escape room ""Ground Zero"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-ground-zero,2,This place is awesome!!! My Sister booked the Ground Zero room for today. We had 6 family members and we needed every single one of us to complete this room in the 75 minutes we were given. Before we entered the room we were told Ground Zero only had a 20% success rate. That scared us. 3 of us have never done an escape room. The rooms were decorated great. So many combination locks to open. So many things to figure out just to get to the second room. There is a 3rd small room attached to the second room. While in the 2nd/3rd rooms we only had around 18 minutes left. We started to really worry. We were all sweating to figure out that last combination to get the door open. We made it with 1:46 to spare. When that lock clicked open we all let out a huge celebratory scream. I would highly recommend The Prism Escape Rooms. I would recommend having the maximum 6 people if you choose the Ground Zero room. We all had a fun time!!

On May 28th I visited this escape game particularly because it was the only place that could accommodate 12 of us in the same room.  I spoke to several employees on different occasions and each time they were patient and very polite! We were originally 8 and grew 4 times, eventually becoming 12. I know it must have been frustrating dealing with our party changing several times & us arriving an hour late on top of everything. The night went perfect! We escaped and had so much fun doing so!!

"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,0,"Captain Judy is so amazing and funny. She is there to help you out when needed when you give her the correct call to request the help. The Titanic room has about 3 rooms you need to break through to end the game. It's so much fun, just remember to talk out loud with your team, this is not a figure out yourself type of game, or you cover that area and I cover that area. It's really a group effort. "
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,1,We did the Titanic Room with a group of 3 on Sunday. Our little group was pretty new to the escape room scene and we were pretty excited to check it out. The building doesn't look like much from the outside but it's super cute on the inside. Captain Judy explained the scenario and told us how to get hints if we needed them (we needed them!). I don't want to give anything away but all of the rooms were decorated great and we had a fun time figuring out the various puzzles.
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,2,"What a lot of fun in one hour! My wife and I were first-timers. Our friends had done an escape room before with 60out at a different location. Ivan oriented us with the do's and don'ts of the rooms and then we were off on the Titanic (yes, I had a sinking sensation going in). This is not an activity for someone with claustrophobia. Figuring out the clues is very challenging, and we did need to get an assist from ""Captain Ivan"" more than once. But we did escape at 59.5 minutes. And we agreed that we would return for another room in the near future!"
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,3,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these. The rooms are set up sooo well and the puzzles are challenging. Not a lot of locks to unlock, I have nothing against opening a lot of locks, I actually like it but these rooms are so incredibly creative that they are amazing. Also, when they give you hints they are very vague and get you thinking so they don't just give away the answers which I appreciate. They also don't put any other players you don't know in the room with you which is a requirement for us.We've done the Titanic and Zen Room at the Marina Del Ray location and Senator Payne at the West LA location. Judy was our Game Master at the Marina location for both rooms. She was amazing! She was so fun and you could tell she really loves her job. We will be back in a couple weeks to do Outbreak Judy!"

The difficulty was noticeably harder than our first room, but some puzzles were exceptionally clever! Our game master, Judy, did a great job providing useful hints without directly giving the answer away. Thanks for being so patient with us!"

The staff has been attentive and friendly. However, the last time I was there it almost seemed as if they were getting impatient with our progress and continued to give us clues even when we hadn't asked.

"Escape room ""Almost Famous"" by Tropic Escape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/tropic-escape-almost-famous,2,"My wife and I have played over 60 escape rooms all over the southeast and Tropic Escape's Rooms are definitely in the top tier of games we've played. The place is a 20-30 minute drive from the Naples area but well worth the trip. We first played the ""Almost Famous"" room and later in the week played the ""Castaway"" room. Both were fantastic and very well done.Almost Famous had great scenic and state-of-the-art equipment inside the room. One of my favorite parts of this room is that you have to make a decision before you even start the game that leads to one of the most unique final puzzles I've ever seen! The tech in this room is amazing. There were a variety of really fun, immersive, hands on puzzles that lead to a ""Wow, how did they make that work?"" reaction when solved. Overall, a very, very fun room.Castaway is touted as their most difficult room and they are not kidding. The room is very challenging, but in a fun way, not in a frustrating or tedious way. There are a lot of puzzles to solve, but the solutions to the puzzles are logical, make sense, and can be solved reasonably quick once you figure out what to do. There is not a lot of ""busy work"" to do just to eat up time. The scenic is also extremely well done. The immersion factor is on point with lightning effects, flickering lights, and the sound of thunder welcoming you as soon as you walk into the room. This room offers several other ""wow"" factors as well.After we finished, we spent some time speaking to the owner and you could tell he got into the escape game business because he loved it. He told us that he only designs and builds games that he'd want to play and be proud of. He is passionate about the industry and you can see that in the product he's created. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. They are among the best in the area."

We went with the family in a group of 6. We went during the day so it was not very crowded. We tried the Mayan ruins. The puzzles were fun and required lots of teamwork to solve. It had the typical setup where you can ask for answers to the harder clues. There were multiple rooms to unlock and explore so that kept the excitement up. Defintely going back to try out one of the other 3 rooms.
"Escape room ""Mayan Temple"" by Red Button Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/red-button-escape-mayan-temple,1,"I have done no less than 10 escape rooms.

Really enjoyed my experience in Omescape today!"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,1,"Omgosh!! It was my first time playing a real-life escape game!! I have played a number of online ""escape the room"" games a long time ago, but nothing beats bringing something from the virtual world to REAL LIFE! It was so amazing and so much fun. Once you are inside the room, it was like an escape from reality and became one of those characters inside the computer game. The execution is great and the props are well set-up! I highly recommend coming here with a group of friends because it is such a great bonding experience and it is all about teamwork as well. We came as a party of 7 today to celebrate our friend's birthday. We played the Omega Room, which is suppose to be the easier room from the Penitentiary, with a escape success rate of 33%. It was so tense and exciting and we were mind blown when we solved each puzzle. I'm guilty to say that I was getting scared from the music haha. The staff who worked here tonight was super nice and helped us out a bit when we were stuck :)!! We didn't managed to escape within 60 minutes though... dang it! but the staff still let us finish the game! We then proceeded to take numerous pictures in front of their big wall drop with funny props.It was a great experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for The Penitentiary Room!! which currently has a escape success rate of 11%.A MUST TRY. BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE NOT, YOU ARE MISSING OUT. :)"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,2,"Really quite fun. If you like scouring the room for clues and then figuring out the riddles to access a new room to scour for clues... this is the game for you! Having now completed Omega (less than a minute to spare) and the Forgotten Treasure (couldn't get the last clue in time), nothing was impossible but having (at least 6) people has worked well for us. When someone just doesn't understand how to solve a problem, at least one person will stumble upon how to solve it. It's frustrating in the good way! Occasionally something mundane like finding a loose object among 4 rooms will stop you, which is genuinely frustrating. For the most part, people can collaborate on the puzzles however there are a couple of choke points (particularly hard last puzzle of FT) that really don't lend themselves to having more than 1 or 2 people work on the puzzle.The staff is nice and give you one Hint to help you get through if you get stuck. If you just think it doesn't make sense, I recommend radioing in not for a Hint but asking if you understand it correctly, because sometimes you are just missing something and you won't finish even if you think it over for 30 minutes. If they say the answer is a Hint, then you can reconsider if you really want to ask.The FT had some clever new puzzles that I liked but I think the Omega room was generally more fun. They had a groupon that was going that cut the cost in half (only for Omega) that I would highly recommend doing.Omega had a 39% success rate and Penitentiary and Forgotten Treasure were both half as much (was it 13% or 19%?). We were amped up after completion (successful or not) and it's really quite exciting and strenuous (again, in a good way)! The themes are a bit silly but overall tie it together well and it's just darned fun!!"
"Escape room ""Room Omega"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/room-omega-ca,3,"This was the first escape room experience for my friends and me and we had a blast. It took a bit of convincing to get everyone to go to Richmond and the discounted deal we purchased definitely helped. Once we got to Omescape, we all became focused on solving the puzzles. There were 7 in our group and we tried the easiest room, ""Omega,"" which has a time travel theme.We found the clues to be very clever and exciting. There was a glitch at the start in which we were actually let into the second room before we solved the puzzles to get to that stage. We quickly backtracked and found the proper way to get into that room. It would have been nice if the staff had checked the rooms before we entered.We got stuck on one clue in the second room and we used our one ""lifeline"" there. Once we got past that point, we quickly figured out the remaining clues and rushed out of the room in 55 minutes.It was so much fun that I would have loved to do another room on the spot but we had another appointment to go to and we were terribly hungry and that will have to wait until next time."

OMESCAPE - OMEGA4. THE BASEMENT (in LA) - THE BASEMENT5. ESCAPESF - ALCATRAZ6. PANIQ ROOM - SICKO7. PANIQ ROOM - GEEKComing back in a couple of weeks to try the Penitentiary and Forgotten Treasure!"

We had to work together to get the answers. Solving the clues took everyone; and even our 11 year old got one big piece. The props were very professionally made. They had spent a lot of time setting the scene. The 15 year old also got into it as we all did but she led the team. We were breathless as we revealed the answer and cheered loudly.

We booked a whole room and had 3 generations of our family doing the Classroom escape -- ages ranging from from 85 to 15 years old -- and everyone had a great time (the staff were kind enough to bring in a comfortable chair for the older members of our family). Everyone loved it and we plan to go back and try some of the other rooms. Was a great family activity and afterwards we went out to dinner and had a great time.

"Escape room ""Hostage"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-hostage,2,"I came here with some friends on a Sunday evening, and had a blast! We had the nicest Gamemaster.  One member of our party was running late, so we weren't able to start on time. Normally, that means they would take away playing time, but since nobody was after us, the Gamemaster allowed us to start late, and still gave us the full 60 minutes to breakout, which was great because we needed every single minute of it!We did the Hostage room. I loved figuring out all the clues.  It was also a unique experience as it was my first time being blindfolded and handcuffed, so be prepared for that if you are doing this room.  I also really loved the amount of technology that was used in this room.  All in all a good time!"

"Escape room ""Pirate Peril"" by Escape LOL in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-lol-pirate-peril,0,"One of my birthday presents was an escape room. We chose the Pirate Peril. We solved the mystery, but didn't make it under the required hour timeframe. Missed it by eight minutes. The four of us did extremely well considering the room can hold up to ten people. So, we'll take it. Lol!Recommend Escape LOL to everyone! Great clues, excellent guides, and tons of fun! "
"Escape room ""Pirate Peril"" by Escape LOL in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-lol-pirate-peril,1,"Just succeeded in the Pirate's Peril, but it was tough. 2 of us were sailors (we had total of 8 in our group). I've been thru several of these and each time just barely missed the timeline. This time whether due to the team-mates or luck, (I like to think it was the players) we made it out.

"Escape room ""Pirate Peril"" by Escape LOL in Pensacola",https://worldofescapes.com/pensacola/quests/escape-lol-pirate-peril,2,"Yesterday myself and 8 teenagers went and did the Pirate Peril escape for my daughter's 15th birthday.

We had a great time as Wizards and enjoyed all the activities in this room. The room has a little wear and tear so some items give themselves away pretty easily but we had a great time! The Medieval room was another story. They do say it is scary and I found that to be very true. But it was more macabre (dead severed heads, creepy sound effects, and torture devices). If that's your thing- enjoy. That room was hard though- so hustle!"

"Escape room ""The Fun House"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Cross-Roads-Escape-Games-The-Fun-House,1,Had the most amazing time!There is no slacking and letting your friends lead in this game. Everyone must do their own part of the puzzle before you can come together as a group.Room is detailed and immersive. Characterization is unique and adds a fun element.Highly recommended!
"Escape room ""The Fun House"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Cross-Roads-Escape-Games-The-Fun-House,2,"LOVED this escape room!!When I first received the invite to come along, I thought okay, what is going to set this one apart from the rest? I've been to my share of escape rooms, some were great, others needed to mature a little more, but after you've done so many, you want to find a uniqueness about the next one.I read the concept of everyone starting off separated into different rooms, that really caught my eye. The idea of everyone being a different character based on a quirky personality test was also nice. I had my eye set on being the detective (which I was able to be ). I watched as my friends became elected into the other positions - the jock, the rebel, the nerd, the virgin and the prom queen.To conquer this escape room, you really need the right dynamic. Everyone has their own puzzles to conquer, but at the same time, one may have something for someone in another room. I don't want to spoil much, but I will speak from being the detective. If you find yourself in this spot, I hope you don't get overwhelmed easy. You are the glue that bonds everyone and it is your responsibility to make sure everyone is okay and gets what they need.I highly recommend this room and will be speaking nothing but good things about it to anyone interested. What a great team at Crossroads, I can't wait to see what rooms you all come up with next."

Without spoiling anything, I have to say that this room was really fantastic. It has really awesome production value and you really feel like you are in the environment. The puzzles were the perfect amount of difficulty for my group. We escaped with a couple minutes to spare, but still felt the urgency at the end. It was the first time my friends were doing an escape room and it was the perfect intro into the world of escape rooms. They loved it. "

There were 6 of us total which fills up the max capacity.I have to admit that this escape room by far has the highest production value that I've experienced. Everything was fully functional and interactive. The room was quite challenging, so we were given an extra 10 minutes since we were so close, and finished only 3 minutes over! I have to admit, it was extremely kind of our host to give us the extra time and we left super satisfied.We will definitely be back again!"

Shout out to the staff for being so amazing as well. The first time my group was late (don't recommend showing up late to anyone though), but they still let us have a full hour.

We ask for a refund and was told they couldn’t do that because they had no control over what was done over the internet.   Just a few of us had ever been before and we got no where solving the clues.   We had to ask for help in every step and then ask how it was solved and we weren’t even 1/16th through it before our hour was up.   Told them that half of us just sat on the floor and we were so disappoint.   Then they told us it was difficult that they created it and they even had trouble solving it.   Maybe they should tell you this when you are checking in.  I could of found a much better way to spend my $170.  The ones who never had done this before will probably never go to another one.

"Escape room ""Budapest Express"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/Escapology-BUDAPEST-EXPRESS,6,"Escapology, which holds a special place in my heart for being my first escape room experience, recently opened their latest game - Budapest Express. After successfully defeating it last night, I believe they saved the best for last (or at least, for most recent).Budapest Express was the absolute perfect blend of fun and challenge. The kinds of puzzles found in the room were excellently varied. While some required us to find keys in unexpected places, others required us to put together several different clues and work out a logical puzzle, while still others necessitated a calm demeanor and focused concentration.The best aspect of Budapest Express, for me, was that it's one of the very few rooms we've experienced in which the storyline *matters*. Every escape room has a story line, whether it's a gun fight at the OK Corral, stealing a diamond from a vault, or curing a plague. But most of the time, that story is irrelevant to the puzzles you have to find and solve. Not so at Budapest Express - our roles as detectives onboard a train which had become the scene of a murder was instrumental in solving the puzzles and ""escaping"" the room. It added a very welcome layer of excitement and realism to our escape room experience.I've been impressed with Escapology since my first experience with them last year. Having now done all five of their rooms, plus 12 others at competing locations in Orlando and Tampa, I can safely say that Escapology is in the running for the most enjoyable escape room company I've visited. And it is by far the most professional. The well themed lobby and the employees with whom I've interacted create a sense that Escapology is serious business, rather than a hobby or part-time job. The game masters truly care about creating rooms that will give their customers a fantastic experience, and it shows.Another excellent quality of Escapology is that it is one of only 2 Orlando-area escape games (out of 7, at last count) that allows your party to book a room exclusive to yourselves, without the possibility of any strangers joining you. For those who want an experience with just your family and friends, Escapology is for you. Even just two of you can book the entire room for yourselves. That Escapology does this, to increase the guest experience, at the sacrifice of making more money off a room's time slot, goes to show how much they care about their customers, more than just trying to pad their bottom line.I've loved every game I've played at Escapology, and am anxiously looking forward to their 6th game, which I'm told may in fact be opening in the next couple months!"

We found this place and booked the room, and I must say, of the 15 or so rooms I've done, this one ranks top 3, maybe even number 1 or 2. It was a simple set up (very horror themed, like Saw) with a great mix of challenging puzzles, electronic locks, and electronic switches. Just when you think you've seen every part of the room, something happens. We were so happy with the first room, we actually booked the second room right after and did The Playroom as well. That one is great for kids, as it's reminiscent of an elementary classroom, with very clever puzzles, motif, and style. Overall, a 10/10 experience.

"Escape room ""The Lair"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/thelair-escapedom,0,"So my friend, her father, and I decided that we wanted to go on a fun escape room on a Friday night right? The service and general idea of the room was supposed to be ""not scary"" and we supposedly played a kids version. Late into the game, we got stuck. We asked for a clue and the guide gave us false information and then said ""my bad"" at the end when we couldn't escape. If that wasn't enough, my friend was horrified even though it wasn't supposed to be scary at all. There were mangled dolls draped across the ceiling and eerie sound played in the background. You had to undress a Barbie to find one of the clues, which I personally find extremely disturbing. It was said that we played the kids version, however, many elements of it seemed more mature. We were really bummed at the end since we weren't offered a refund for the mistake that was made. They acted like the issue wasn't a big deal, but the ""customer is always right"".

We didn't know exactly what to expect but ended up thoroughly enjoying it. I'd recommend it to groups of friends/colleagues who want to do something fun for a solid hour with no distractions except the mysteries you're trying to solve. The hosts were fun and entertaining and even spent time with us after to get our feedback.
"Escape room ""Cold War Crisis"" by American Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/american-escape-rooms-tampa-cold-war-crisis,0,"My friends surprised me with an escape room for my birthday and this place was a great choice for this. Because they mentioned that it was my birthday, the game master included an extra clue in our room as a birthday present to me. We did the Cold War Crisis. Fantastic room and with great clues. It definitely tested us well. We got out with about four minutes to spare and at times we were definitely concerned that we weren't going to make it out. The timer that they have in the room also includes a counter at the bottom that helps you track how many clues you get and the standard amount of clues that you get is 5. This room was rated 5/5 for difficulty which I think is aptly earned. Our game master Alexa was great. Super friendly and helpful before and after the room. Overall, great experience and I would definitely go back again."

Jumanji is one of our two favorite escape rooms in LA, and Fire & Ice is our third favorite. These are high-quality escape rooms with strong production design and story. They are high-tech escape rooms with lots of magnetic-opens and pretty much no combination or key locks. If you like escape rooms that require you to find combination and keys to open locks, these are not your rooms. But if you like ""OH! THAT'S COOL!"" moments in your escape rooms, 60Out rooms are for you. All of the rooms we did were impressive and amazing, but HANDS DOWN, the Jumanji room will blow your mind with its production value, set design, script, and puzzles. Unlike linear puzzle rooms, several different puzzles can be done simultaneously in this room, which makes it fun for groups. We look forward to doing more 60Out rooms!"

I also appreciated the mechanical, dexterity-based puzzles in both rooms (especially Shady Tavern) which I haven't really seen in other rooms before.

"Escape room ""Secrets in Suburbia"" by Breach Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-scene-escape-rooms-secrets-in-suburbia,0,"Located in an anonymous industrial park off Lambert Street near Lake Forest Drive, The Scene Escape Rooms is a little hard to find but definitely worth the effort. If you’ve never experienced an escape room, the way it works is that your group (in our case, a family of five) is locked in a room and is given 60 minutes to find the way out by solving different puzzles and finding related clues that eventually lead to the key that will open the door to freedom and victory.The reception area is attractive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. We tackled the “Secrets in Suburbia” room, a murder mystery set in a suburban neighborhood circa 1962. The room was well-designed and nicely themed, and the puzzles were detailed and logical. NOTE that there is some math involved in one puzzle, so it may be helpful to bring a calculator – fortunately, my son is an engineer and easily handled the math problems.This was my fourth experience with an escape room, and “Secrets in Suburbia” was probably the room I’ve enjoyed the most so far.

"Escape room ""Lab Rat"" by Hatch Escapes in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/hatch-escapes-lab-rat,0,"Lab Rat was a very unique and entertaining escape room. The story and room were very well done. The room is challenging but flows well with one of the most unique layouts I've seen. The staff was great and friendly. We did the room with 8, and I think 6 would have been more ideal but all of us had an equal amount of fun. And that's not to say the room can't be done with a wide range of group sizes. I'm looking forward to the next Hatch Escapes room that's designed."

We escaped this room with 15 minutes left to spare. Although most of the puzzle are just basic locks and keys, this room uses some more higher tech puzzles than the Houdini room. With that being said I thought that the difficulty level was about same between both. There are lots of puzzles that keep you moving and thinking the entire time and there is never a dull moment. We did have to use our hints and the GM did a great job of pointing us in the right direction yet not blatantly giving us the answer, which I appreciate. 	I am also happy to report that the rooms now have countdowns them! Also the staff is still as amazing and friendly as they were last time. They do a great job explaining the rooms backstory, the rules, and ways to get help if you need it. This time we even got to see some magic tricks while we were waiting for our room. 	If you are looking for an escape room to do that is well themed and well priced, I highly recommend Theme Quest! Can’t wait to go back for the Bonnie and Clyde room! "

We did the Orient Express room and we were definitely impressed by how much they managed to fit into this small room. We had just come off a room at a different company that was very spacious and had many rooms and lots of fancy technology, but we felt like solving the puzzles required too much guesswork and not enough logic. After that, this room was a total breath of fresh air. The staff was also super helpful and friendly. Magic tricks in the lobby was a fun bonus too! Definitely will be going back to try their other rooms. They also said they are expanding, which is great, because this place definitely has a lot of potential."

"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,0,The Secret Mission and Lunar Mission are really great intricate puzzles. The story and way you get through the rooms is refreshingly different. They do a few things other escape rooms don't to make you feel completely immersed.
"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,1,"Spy - Barely just a fortnight old, the production for this is the best in my opinion, edging out the castle by a bit. Stepping through the door, you really do get a feel as if you're in a 70s-80s apartment with puzzles cleverly lining throughout the room. The puzzles also blend together well, along with neat uses of several everyday items. Digging the vibe of this room."

So we signed up for a later experience where you have to discover the identity of a Russian Spy.  That experience was AWESOME! The rooms were decked out in 60s mid century modern and everything about the clues and room made you feel like you were really into the story.  Even the guy who set us up intro'd it well.  Will definitely be going back to do some of their other more challenging ones!"

I've never done anything like this before, wasn't sure what to expect, and thought it would be interested at the least. Let me just say this was the most fun I've had in a very long time. We did Patient 57, which was the easiest (6/10 difficulty). 60 minutes to escape the room. 3 hints available. Unlock everything to get the codes to escape. This was perfect. Difficult enough to get me thinking but not too difficult that we couldn't figure anything out. Basically everything revolves around codes, phones, keys, and combination locks. Everything and anything can be relevant. Almost everything in the room is there for a reason. It's a progression from one code/lock/thing opened to the next until you get the code to leave the room. We finished with 23 seconds left. Unreal. Patient 57 currently has a 33% escape rate."

Well, it was a really team building.  Everyone help each other to find clues and solve the mission.  It was perfect breakout to show our communication and teamwork as a team.  This place is great place to test your skills and work as a group.  Highly recommend for everyone needing a team building workshop or just for fun.  Great for everybody.  The location we did was in Beachwalk by Lewers.  There is a price per person or group.  The overwhelming from work was a paid off but we were overwhelmed from here.  But in a fun way......

We got a little lost (note 405B is NOT next to 405A). We called and the front desk girl ran out and flagged us down.  My husband and I had done escape rooms before, but our friends had not. The girl who checked us in was very clear with her instructions and answered all questions.  She definitely made them feel more comfortable with the game.  I know it can be intimidating for people who don't know what to expect! We did the Mentryville escape room.  It was SO much fun, and I was really proud of our completion. First of all, thank goodness 4 people are the max. I have been to an escape room around the same size where they stuffed 8 people in and I honestly thought I would pass out. The puzzles were ingenious! And I have to say the ghost (Tony/Samuel) was excellent.  We would highly recommend this escape room and we look forward to doing another one sometime soon."

The actor in this room really is part of the room and sets the eerie, but not scary mood.  The puzzles and tasks in this room are clever and some of the best integrated I have seen and experienced in any room. The set pieces and narration transport you to places well beyond the confines of the room itself and your imagination fleshes out even more details.  There is no strict time limit for this room and the guidance is generous. There is an urgency to complete this room because of the need to resolve situations and close the loop. Good things come in small escape rooms."

But make sure to double book so the teams can switch rooms and do it again! I seriously loved both ""worlds"" so much that I would have been disappointed had we not done both in one day.

"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,1,"4.5 starsWe had a smaller group this time (4) compared to to our usual escape group but that wasn't going to stop us! The fates of two realms hung in the balance! We also happened to have two 13 year olds with us and one of them had no experience in escape rooms so we wanted a place that would be a good introduction. I was intrigued by the asymmetrical set up of the When Worlds Collide room. So much that it overcame my worries that it would be too much for an inexperienced player and such a small group. Without giving anything away, this particular game is set up so that two groups can play against each other! One in the ""Fantasy realm"" and one in ""Reality"". Its essentially the same story, and the groups don't really interact with each other except for the fact that only one realm can be triumphant. Other escape rooms I've played with two separate groups I'd consider a parallel setup because both groups play two copies of the same room, and whichever group finishes first wins. Here, whoever finishes first wins but the two rooms are completely different so if you are so inclined, you can come back and play the other side so try to avoid spoilers after your post game sharing! All this makes When World's collide a great option for a large group. Up to twelve people can play (6 in each realm). Or even as small a group as ours with some experienced players (2 in each realm). Or take your normal group and play each side on different occasions, that's an option as well! Thanks to our game master Chris for explaining and giving us our clues. We had a great time! The only thing that we noticed is that the temp could get a bit hot in the rooms so dress appropriately! I found that we were concentrating on our mission so intently that it wasn't all that of an inconvenience but I'm sure some would like to know."

We split into two groups of 3 and competed against each other - one group in fantasy and one in reality. We had so much fun that we went back the next night to compete again, with the teams switching rooms. I did the reality room the first night, which I thought was a bit more challenging than the fantasy room. We were on the last puzzle when the time ran out. The group in the fantasy room still had several puzzles left to get through. The 2nd night I did the reality room and we made it out with 12 minutes to spare. We had such a great time in both rooms, and the girls who worked there were fantastic.

I also think that some of the puzzles were not logical and without a clue, I have no idea how anyone could have figured out what to do.

Wherever I expected something go be a bit 'low budget', I was pleasantly wrong. There is a lot of thought and effort to making a lot of these secret hatches cool and surprising. Just when I thought something was only another decoration, a puzzle would pop it open.The whole place was clean and professional too. A definite thumbs up, and ill be back for sure with more people to try one of the larger rooms.Thanks again Adam!"

"Escape room ""Beta Labs"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/phoenix-puzzle-room-beta-labs,0,"These rooms are fantastic. They are well thought out, challenging, and rewarding. Captain Lockjaw, Madame Lumina, and the Pearled Pachyderm are really great for first timers or experienced puzzle room fans. The Beta Lab room is simply challenging - no antics, no frills, just boxes, locks, and puzzles so I don't recommend it for people looking for the more engaging/ theatrical experience. All in all, we were thrilled with all of these rooms and would gladly revisit if and when a new room is created."

We did Esc Escape Rooms ""Nuclear Option"" last night and it was amazing. I haven't seen much discussion about this one in my Facebook escape room groups, but it's in a double wide shipping container in North Hollywood behind a tiny community theater. Room was super fun, creative, and the owner Rick was a hoot. Highly recommended. This one deserves more way attention from the community. I've done more than 100 rooms worldwide, and this is one of the more memorable ones. Superbly well executed and staged. Check it out!"

We went for our second escape room there and ended up doing a VR experience this time around. Medusa's gate was one of the COOLEST experiences I've ever been in. Mary was the one that helped us get started and she was the sweetest person ever. So helpful during the game as well. After the fact, Kevin was able to help us wrap up and was super enthusiastic as well. Glad I'm a part of their loyalty program. :)"

"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,0,"This review comes from a group that has completed about 20 escape rooms across the nation, including in cities such as Orlando, St. Louis, Las Vegas. We have encountered some so-so rooms, some decent rooms, and some amazing rooms. What we LOVE - They don’t mix you with strangers in the rooms! That is awesome! This room, the Zombie Lab, was a little bit of a disappointment for us. We had previously done, over several years, both the Bank Heist and the Western room at this venue. The western themed room has the best theming of them all, as it is the most immersive, though even there you’ll see odds and ends that appear to be incomplete, like a certain ceiling tile installation/work-around that looks sloppy.  First off - TONS of locks. Locks, locks, locks! That is typical of many entry-level rooms. The puzzles ARE fun, but not many of the puzzles relate to the stories! It seems like the rooms are decorated, and then filled with a hodgepodge of random puzzles that don’t actually contribute to the theme or the story. You’re walking around thinking, “How is this puzzle related to the story at all?”  Another aspect that is a bit of a letdown: Having to watch an intro video in the lobby in front of other groups. It’s just awkward standing around a television next to the counter to watch a poorly written (and full of grammatical errors and misspellings!) video before entering the room. Lastly, it would be nice if the employees conveyed some enthusiasm for the job at hand. The instruction segment given to each group by the employee is too long and rushed. It’s a LOT of talking for them, and they talk fast to get through it, which is just annoying for everybody. The instructions should be more concise. Our favorite to least favorite room at his ensue: #1 Wild West (We were told the owners built this one themselves - They’ve obviously learned a lot from running the other two rooms) #2 The Bank Robbery #3 Zombie Lab "
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,1,I took my 18 year old son and niece to the Zombie Lab. We had a great time and can't wait to try another scenario.

It is such a unique and creatively decorated space- the details really draw you in.  We arrived the 15 minutes early as you are supposed to and were greeted by the owner.  She was super friendly, energetic and you could tell that this place was a passion project for her and her husband.  She chatted us up about their business and we could tell that a lot of planning went into the whole thing.A few minutes later her husband and our game master walked us through our scenario for ""Spellbound"".   My hubby and I were the only two slotted for this spot.  That was a good thing since others were supposed to be with us and the room was a small space.  I am glad we didn't have other people in there or we would have been a bit crammed.  The room was neat.  It had a good combination of technology, quirkiness, puzzles and good old need for attention to details.  We have done about 10 escape rooms between us before this one and it was thoughtfully created and a good level of difficulty.  We made it out with 4 minutes to go too!  It is definitely worth the visit.  I can't wait to check out one of their other rooms next time we are in town!"

My group of friends also had great chemistry to figure Y2K out.The staff was great. They were helpful and friendly. I have never done an escape room before Waikiki Breakout so I have no other places to compare it too.My last note is how the location was great. There's a parking garage underneath King Village that I tend to favor parking at over other places in Waikiki. My deal breaker on a lot of places being awesome to hang out is more often than not based on the parking situation."

After some chatting he told us the back story to 'The Will,' their newest room. We went in having read the prologue, but not really knowing what to expect.

The story is incredible, the decorations so realistic and the puzzles super AMAZING ! We are a bit sad that it is the only escape room we didn't escape (only for 20 seconds). We don't remember the name of the girl that hosted us, but thank you so much for letting us finish the game despite the time that was over.I don't know if it's because it was our very first escape room, but we really had a blast ! We loved the fact that almost all the pieces in the room were to be used, not too much useless information that could lead you to a false way.

I did the insane asylum with my girlfriend's family today and we really enjoyed the clever puzzles, creepy ambiance, and fantastic receptionist. The only thing I would change is the size for the price. I totally understand there's only so much that can be done with the size of the house, and while definitely worth it, I think that a larger place with more puzzles and traveling (inside, outside, roof access, adjacent housing, etc.) would really add to the experience. I could definitely see myself spending a bit more for a couple hours in a mansion solving similar puzzles--but that's just me.All that said, this was a whole lot of fun and I will be back!"

"Escape room ""Insane Asylum"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-insane-asylum,5,"WOOHOO! We escaped the Asylum and with an additional 20 minutes to spare too!The concept is simple, you and your group of 5 friends are locked in a dark room and you have 1 hour to find a key to escape. The clock counts down and you are left scrambling through props and items in the room to solve puzzles and quizzes in hopes of finding clues to get out. Prior to starting the game, they will go over the rules and have you sign waivers. I've played several escape room games and this one was challenging yet really fun! I would highly suggest it for a first timer player. Tips:-The best way to solve the clues is to work together. I can't stress enough that team work is vital! Keep track of your clues and communicate with everyone so you don't have 5 people looking for the same clues. -Wear comfortable clothes! It can get really hot/cold in the rooms so wear something you feel comfortable moving around in.-Keep hydrated and use the restroom beforehand. You will be LOCKED in the room for an hour!-Be very observant. There's clues everywhere! Look underneath stuff, in cervices, high above you, move things around...etc-Parking is terrible here! We ended up parking right next to the building because we couldn't fit our car in the tiny driveway. Make sure you tell them where you parked your car so you don't get towed."

It's a bit hard to find parking on the busy Barham Blvd, but there is street parking if you look for it.I have done both the Asylum and the Bunker rooms and they are both fun in their own way.  Without giving away too much, I liked the puzzles in the Bunker and the atmosphere in the Asylum.  Everything is pretty well thought out.  The hour flies by.  I love the tension and relief of every puzzle.  It's very satisfying to hear that *click* when a lock is open.They have great customer service and guide you through what you need to know about the experience.  I'm definitely ready for the next room!"

I loved trying it once but I'm not sure I can do it again. Haha this kind of experience is aimed toward gamers who like to solve puzzles on the spot. I'm the take my time kind of person so this was so fast paced for me. I came here with a group of 6 to try out the Bunker room. Parking is really crazy with a max of three cars pulling into a narrow lane in front of the place. Carpool if you can! Before the craziness starts you get a lot of info and then of goes the timer.I would suggest bringing as many people as possible because you need all the thinking brains! Video gamers highly recommended haha. We all had a lot of fun and were just running all over the place and we were able to solve it under the given time limit. Pretty cool but not the shortest time ever! We were aiming for that of course but not all dreams get fulfilled. Even though I wasn't the main puzzle solver I still had a lot of fun doing this experience. There's a good mix of puzzle solving and just finding clues that there is a lot to do. It's good to try this at once, and if you like it, there are other rooms too!"

He immediately got us in the room and gave us instructions. The room itself, Protocol Zero, was incredible. The technology was super advanced, everything was connected and organized so well. It was a really well thought out room. We were able to escape, but we were not left confused as to how things worked, we knew exactly how everything worked and how everything was connected.

For me personally the best one was the Penitentiary! It has a very cool laser tunnel and we were separated into two groups and had to work together to rescue the two that were locked up in a room and escaped together.

My group of five has done about 20 escape room across the nation, and this was not the worst we've done, but not the best.The decor looked old, dirty, and worn out. It also seemed quite sparse, like someone threw this room together hastily in their garage or something. The puzzles were okay, but one of them seemed completely nonsensical and we're not sure how average folks are intended to guess how it works without assistance. Maybe we're dumb, but there's only one room we didn't completely in our entire history of playing escape games; And we rarely ever ask for clues..So, who's to say?I would recommend the Six Shooter room over this one any day. Also - Locks locks locks galore! Not our favorite escape room attribute. "

When rating escape rooms, I look for specific characteristics such as difficult and unique puzzles, good theming, a good story, etc. Mindquest's bomb room met all of those expectations.As I have done many escape rooms, it's important to reiterate that I believe this room to be good for people with all types of experience in escape rooms.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day?

I booked the alien encounter for my daughters and two friends in Sept 2016. They enjoyed it very much. They had a few ""scares"" and creepy moments which delighted them, and the puzzles made them think outside the box. They had to work together and really think things out which really was cool. The staff member (only met one) was incredibly nice. We all filled out the liability waiver before arriving but it didn't go through apparently and we had to do it again, this could pose a problem for under aged minors who need parental consent. You may want to call to ensure all is well before bringing kids that don't belong to you. There were two other groups there that said they also filled waiver out online and it didn't ""stick"".Downside: other escape rooms have monitors in lobby so those not participating can watch their party. I just had to sit there for an hr. would have been nice to watch them. Also, 5pts area is a hell hole. I just wish this wasn't in such a bad part of town. Two of the girls went back to car before starting and were approached by two different men trying to talk to them. No way would I want them down there alone and after hearing this, I wanted to shoot myself for letting them go back to car alone. Once inside Paranoia we felt safe, but walking from car not so much. I did see several APD through window while inside."

It is a small room, but it's meant to be on a train. They had screens that showed the city of Tempe passing by like you were on the light rail. Very nice touch. We all enjoyed the escape room and made it out with 10 minutes to spare and didn't even use all our clues!!

We had small groups working on several clues at once. Our only complaint was some of the clues were too difficult, and the hint didn't help us that we spent a majority of the last 20 minutes in the room stuck. It was one of the most detailed escape rooms I've been to, and if you are looking for a challenge, i recommend it!!"

We took the Harry Potter challenge and I was amazed at the level of detail and the sheer brilliance of the clues and their hiding places. I'm scared of revealing too much but my favorite clues were the deceptively easy ones (clues that looked easy but were surprisingly difficult). I have one suggestion: I recommend putting out a poll or suggestion box for different rooms so that you guys can get more ideas for future room themes (My suggestions for a potential theme are a Sherlock Holmes or Clue theme). I can't wait for the next room change and I highly recommend it to people who want to play with friends or clubs who are looking to build teamwork! ORDER OF THE PHOENIX FOR LIFE!

I played the Lost Kingdom and the Treasury of Empire: Allies before. I was here to take the challenge for the Treasury of Empire again. Since I played the Treasury of Empire: Allies, I knew that this time would not be an easy game. Although this time was still for the theme room the Treasury of Empire, the puzzles were totally different due to the different story line. The agent side was differently in the room, puzzles, and clues. On this sides, it had more electronic stuffs. It made the game to be more interesting. Also, I like the idea of the telephone.

More people with great team work will definitely higher helpful!Before the game started, the game master introduced the background story to us. In fact, all three rooms in this store are all connected together. I believe we should started with the first part of story to see the whole story. With the brief introduction from the game master, we knew that we have traveled back to WWII time and trying to get out of this military base. With this story introduction, we have had the idea about why we are here and what we are looking for. I believe that introduce is very important. Also, he told us many tips and rules.Generally, this is a great escape room experience. Although the game is not easy, we still enjoy the game very much. I like this type of challenge!"

We succeeded in our mission of finding a vial in a war bunker in under an hour!Overall, South Beach Room Escape was awesome at being an escape room but also goes above and beyond in making sure that their customers are having a good time before and after their game.

Unfortunately right before I parked, I drove by and heard a few managers or owners yelling at their employee. This poor person was getting yelled at while looking completely miserable. I will NEVER book a game here and suggest people don't either. I would NEVER pay a buisiness that treats their staff like animals. Please never come here and I will recommend that people DON'T come here. Very disgusting to see that people are treated like that."
"Escape room ""The Woods"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-the-woods,1,"A group of friends and I visited A Narrow Escape and did “The Woods” Room. We had a great time at this new venue.The highlight of the trip wasn’t the room, but the fantastic team behind the rooms that we all got to meet. The passion that this family has put into their business is evident throughout their gorgeous scenery in-room, their commitment to keeping their puzzles themed and not just a series of numbers and locks, and their genuine interest in feedback and desire to provide an excellent experience.We were three escape room veterans and three new escapists. My crew has escaped from some pretty tough rooms in the Orlando area, all billed as the “hardest” room at their respective venues, with 10% or lower advertised escape rates. I have to say the Woods was the most challenging Room we ever encountered, by a long shot. I’m not sure how the other rooms at Narrow Escape compare to this one, but definitely go prepared for a tough challenge.I can’t say enough good things about the people behind A Narrow Escape, all of whom worked hard throughout our escape to make sure we had a good time, and ask for genuine feedback. Top notch customer service, and some of the best scenic work I’ve seen. Check them out!"

We did the zookeeper room since we had our 8 year old and 3 year old with us and it was perfect. Our 3 year old was busy with all the animal things in the room and the rest of us were busy solving our mission. Nothing like a room for 6-12 year olds to make an adult feel a little less than though haha Hands down recommend this for anyone who wants to be fully engulfed in a game and have fun. We will absolutely return.

"Escape room ""Lost in Time"" by Mastermind Escape Games in Augusta",https://worldofescapes.com/augusta/quests/mastermind-escape-games-augusta-lost-in-time,1,"We went and played Lost in Time yesterday. I don't think we did particularly well, but the loudspeaker helpers were great.You want something fun to do, this is definitely a great option! All the employees we met were very nice, super helpful, and willing to explain everything. We'll be back, it might just take us a little bit because the price is a bit steep."

"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-time-machine,0,"By almost any measure, the nautilus and time machine rooms were very good escape rooms. Do they have faults? Yes. The ""kraken"" you battle in the Nautilus looks like an original Nintendo character, reminding you of a 90s video game as opposed to an immersive experience. And many parts of the Time Machine room feel like an underwhelming museum exhibit. But overall, these are above average escape rooms that in most other cities would be top-of-the-line.I would say these are perfect escape rooms for new participants. They are immersive, and creative, and generally fun. They will deliver solid experiences to establish what escape rooms are all about.For experienced gamers, however, these rooms were let downs. The puzzles were too straightforward and predictable, These rooms were linear to a fault. And the production value does not match the leaders in the city (Questroom and the Basement). That said, 60Out offers reasonable pricing and still very enjoyable experiences. I expect to return for some of their more advanced rooms such as Jumanji."
"Escape room ""Suite Escape"" by Count:down Escape Games in West Palm Beach",https://worldofescapes.com/west-palm-beach/quests/countdown-escape-games-suite-escape,0,"Tucked away in the corner of a Home Depot shopping plaza, it's easy to miss if you don't see the sign right away. There was a coupon that we decided to use for the game. We went for the Suite Escape room. It's the hardest one come to find out after we got there and we decided to attempt it.The room as well as the other two that are there consists of locks and combos to open by figuring out puzzles and using clues for them in the room.  It's better to have more than less in the group since it helps with the brainstorming and solving of the puzzles. Even though our group lost, we still had fun and we plan to go back to do a different room next time."

"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by Escape U in St. Augustine",https://worldofescapes.com/st-augustine/quests/escape-u-the-asylum,0,We came in tonight and played The Lighthouse and Asylum. We escaped both and had a great time! We have played several rooms before and these were both really intricate and unique. The Asylum is easily one of my favorite rooms now. We escaped with only 4 minutes left and were told we were only 1 of 4 groups to make it out. It's easy to see how because this one is not for the easily frustrated! We can't wait to come back and try the last room.

We're big escape room fans and went with our friends who had never done an escape room before. They loved it just as much as we did. Our host was excellent and gave us clues at the perfect time. We found the puzzles to be appropriately difficult - sometimes escape rooms have clues that are very obscure and aren't very logical. Highly recommend this one!

"Escape room ""1970's Murder Mystery"" by Escape the Cape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/escape-the-cape-1970s-murder-mystery,2,"I travelled back in time with friends Friday evening to solve a murder mystery.  Who knew Cape Coral had a time travel portal?!?  It's right off of Pine Island Road.  The experience was a groovy ""Blast From The Past"" and we had a great time.  I'm happy to report we identified the killer and solved this cold case from 1972.We were a group of five adult women.  No one in our group had experienced an escape room previously.  The room was clean and decorated nicely for the story/theme.  The puzzles were challenging but solvable.  The reservation process and interaction with the game master, Patrick, was great.  They offer you hints/nudges if you get stuck.  They genuinely want you to have a positive outcome, weather you experience the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat.In my opinion, you don't need any previous experience to enjoy this room.  Their rooms accommodate up to eight people but I felt our group size was perfect.  We had enough people to search for clues and solve puzzles without feeling crowded or that there were too many people trying to do the same thing.  I wouldn't suggest this for a date but a double-date might be a lot of fun.Tips and Suggestions:  Make sure you arrive early so you can get a briefing from the game master and take care of any business before your time begins.  It may seem obvious but USE THE BATHROOM before you go inside.  Once you leave the room, your game is over.Final Assessment:  Great group activity for friends and/or family.  We laughed, had some great ""a-ha"" moments and made some fun memories.  This was a nice change from a typical Friday evening activity. I'm looking forward to doing this again."

The hints we received while in the room helped make it the success I hoped for. It came down to the wire - 1 second left - and when the door opened we all erupted into a celebration yell and high fives all around. Wonderful experience. Two of our group were initially concerned about feeling trapped in the room, but they didn't have any problem."

We were in separate rooms and had to work together to get to one main room. The only reason that i can't give this a 5 star is because the room wasn't reset completely. Some of the puzzles were already solved so it threw us off because we kept trying to use clues that were already done, but we wouldn't have known. There was more than just one clue that wasn't reset. Overall was a great time."
"Escape room ""Y2K Mystery"" by SUBScape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/subscape-games-y2k-mystery,0,"Y2K Virus was the first room we did.  I feel that this was the easiest of the three rooms we did.  I thought the puzzles were challenging, but simple enough to figure out.  I don't think that there was a moment where we didn't know what we were supposed to do in this room.  It's easy to connect the dots and figure out what to do.  I would say this is an easy-intermediate difficulty room, and would recommend this if this is your first time or if you aren't that experienced at escape rooms.  We were told that Stage Call is their easiest room at Subscape, so if you are a beginner, you can start there as well.  "

The ""Zoe"" room is hands down the scariest room/attraction I've ever been in. I did not know I could even be this scared and honestly fared for my life.

"Escape room ""Zoe"" by Escapade Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapade-games-zoe,7,"Brilliant. Truly one of the escape rooms that pushes the concept toward the potential of what it can be versus simply doing the umpteenth iteration of ""a mad scientist's lab"" or ""a spy's secret office,"" etc. This room is smart, well-planned, and forces you to perform under exciting pressure unique to the minds of its creators.

"Escape room ""Panic Room"" by South Beach Room Escape in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/south-beach-room-escape-panic-room,4,"Honestly, this place is amazing. If you like to use your mind or just want a generally interesting time, you can't beat it. Basically you get locked in a puzzle, similar to Saw (the movies), but without any scares. There are clues hidden all around to help you open the numerous locks, trap doors, and boxes hidden about the rooms. Each puzzle has a goal and I can't wait to get back here and try another room. This is also a really good team building activity as these clues often require more than one person. The only hint I can give you is be observant, from the time you call to book your slot, until you successfully break out of the room ;)What are you waiting for go check these guys out! Oh and by the way, they make you delicious cocktails afterwards for free... Seriously for less than 30 bucks get on it!"

Try this place out! Group of 9 friends came late on a Saturday attempting to do something fun and new. Half our party have done escapes before, so we were pro's, but the rest a bunch of rooks.The way this works is you get locked in a room, and you scour every nook and cranny for clues to unlock locks and solve puzzles, until you bust your way straight outta Compton. (You gently unlock the final door).We did the panic room. We owned that ish. Well at first we did, but we got stuck at the end and barely got out in time.  This particular escape place is not scary, but still keeps you on your toes and your heart racing towards the end.Overall, it was a lot of fun and we had a great time. After we escaped we left and celebrated with dinner and clubbing!"

Basically you get locked inside a room and have to find tools and keys and clues to help get you out within 60 minutes. It's interesting and brain teasing and all in all a fun way to work together w your friends. For only 20-30$, and they offer free cocktails, you can not beat this experience. We will be booking again for a future visit and can't wait to try the other rooms available. I recommend this place for everyone to try at least once!!"

So much attention to detail and overall fun. And the price is even lower than other Escape Rooms. Their Gravitational Effect room was a step-down in puzzle quality, though the interior design was still above-average. I especially enjoyed the physical dynamic in the middle room.

"Escape room ""The Bionic Dilemma"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape,0,We were blown away by the imagination shown in the design of the Bionic Dilemma room. After talking for a while with the designer we understood his passion for originality. They were great fun puzzles with some great surprises. Great time! 
"Escape room ""The Bionic Dilemma"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape,1,"Bionic room was both fun and rather difficult.

We did the story where we tried to break out of an abandoned lab with the help of a Robot named Ada. The story was intriguing, the riddles where clever, and my family had fun over all. Kudos to the guy who put this together."
"Escape room ""The Bionic Dilemma"" by A Narrow Escape in Hot Springs",https://worldofescapes.com/hot-springs/quests/a-narrow-escape,5,"My wife and I took our precocious grandkids, ages 13 and 8, to our first ""escape room"" adventure while on their Spring Break last week. It was the highlight of the whole week. Working as a team, we solved the room's various puzzles, found keys and codes and brain twisting solutions to riddles, problems and posers of all sorts. Ada the trapped Robot became a friend and ally of invaluable worth as we strove to save us all before the power drained out for the ""subterranean"" lab we had stumbled into. Loads of fun and well worth the modest expense. Triple Wow! "
"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,0,My sister and I decided to do the detective room not knowing what to expect and it turned out to be so fun! The puzzles were very challenging but we worked as a team and solved most of the puzzles but ended up running out of time. We are now going to do the cavern next and we are determined to get it of this room. Definitely would recommend!!
"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,1,"We had 50 minutes to follow the clues and escape, we did it in 46 minutes. The clues were challenging but logical and it was really fun to work with good friends and people I didn't know well to solve them."
"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,2,"This experience was quite fun, at first I was a bit hesitant to try this because the thought of being locked in a room with strangers just didn't appeal to me. After my first escape room, I couldn't wait to try all of others. I've seen 3 of the escape rooms from Escape Room LA and their all very well produced and designed, compared to a few others I've seen that aren't nearly as well produced. Once you step into a room, you feel like you're in the environment of the game. Even though you may be a room with strangers, it's fun to be able to talk and meet with new people even if it is for an hour. It's definitely a good way to spend an hour to an hour and a half in LA if you're visiting LA with some free time."
"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,3,"*The Detective*Damn Gina - we didn't escape! :( But overall the entire experience was super fun and a nice alternative to do something different!Diving into the deets:You go into this kinda shady looking building and wonder if you're at the right place, on the outside it looks pretty rundown and nondescript, but trust you're at the right spot. Once you arrive, you'll be waiting in the hallway with others until they call you in. Check in is simple: show your email confirmation on your phone or print out. After, they asked we go around the room and introduce ourselves and give a tiny blurb about yourself, which was a nice icebreaker especially since we didn't know the others that signed up for the same event. Next, they went over the rules and hinted at a couple of things, but nothing that would take away the guesswork from us. The staff waited a couple of minutes past our slotted time for the 2 missing people in our group, but they ended up a no show. There's a last chance to use the restroom, make sure you take it because once you ask to leave the room, you aren't allowed to go back in.Once in the room, they started a clock and we broke into an immediate frenzy. It's good to work in pairs and call out to everyone if you found a clue. Meanwhile, there was a staff member dressed as a detective inside the room and a few times he hinted at something if we half-uncovered a clue and were struggling, in a major way. Without him, I honestly don't think we would have solved 3-5 clues... I could see how some people would be really frustrated if they got stuck.Anyway, the next hour went by REALLY quick! Like a lot of the other reviews say: Teamwork + Communication is KEY to well, find the key! The puzzles overall were fun, some more challenging than others, but clever nonetheless and you had to solve all of them in order to find the key. Time ran out and we didn't escape but had a great time anyway. I'd be interested in trying The Cavern.In the end, the only thing I could think they could improve on is:-Rather than allowing 12 people into a room, I'd say 6-8 max is better.-Allow an additional 10-15 minsThe staff was great in offering to take pictures after the event, even when they were literally given 7 different cameras and took multiple photos on each device. We left with a coupon for their other events, i.e. RaceLA, CityRace.Anyway, last tips:Plan ahead by allotting plenty of time before your scheduled event. Parking is in DTLA where majority of the streets are one-way and if you're trying to save yourself a few dollars, you'll most likely circle around a couple of times before deciding on where to park. The lot right next to building where you do the event was $7 on a Saturday, cash only. HAVE FUN and GOOD LUCK!!!"

One of the owners was working that night (Vhilena) and she was so incredibly sweet. We did the ""Rocket Science"" escape room and it was NOT easy, but we still had a lot of fun. The location is also great and very convenient if you want to visit the Cocoa Beach Pier before or after (it's only about a 5min walk). A great idea for a fun date night or an evening out with friends."

We have done quite a few in Austin and stopped by Santa Barbara on our way home for Thanksgiving and found the House of Clues looking for something to do. The owners are set designers and spent a year building the Pirate Ghost Ship room, on top of building sets for some escape rooms back in Austin!

"Escape room ""Pirate Ghost Ship"" by The House of Clues in Santa Barbara",https://worldofescapes.com/santa-barbara/quests/the-house-of-clues-pirate-ghost-ship,3,"The Haunted Pirate Ship was my 7th escape room and it was definitely in at least the top 2 of the ones I've done. I think what really makes this one stand out is the attention to detail on props/set decoration. The room was absolutely dripping with atmosphere - tons of fun props used in creative, surprising ways, ambient sound, and a surprisingly spacious building despite the small entrance room.The difficulty was about right, with the moderator willing to give hints when we needed them. I felt like the price was a little high for a 45-minute experience. But on the other hand, real estate in Santa Barbara is very expensive and I didn't feel let down by the experience - I would pay for it again, and am looking to come back and try out the Psycho Dentist soon!"

You have to look at everything, and if you don't use something in one room, you may need it in the next.  Or it may be a complete red herring, but you figure that out as you go along.

"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,0,I’ve done several escape the room games and they are always really fun. They’re so different from each other that you can keep going and it’s always a challenge.
"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,1,"Did the Pop Star Room of Doom here with a full group of reasonably experienced ppl, and barely made it out. The main draw of the room is that it's very different than traditional escape rooms: the time loop concept was interesting and is why I'm rating this room as high as I am, and I appreciate that they tried something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately, I found the execution somewhat lacking: the actors were all good, but the main puzzles just weren't that interesting, and there was a particular thing you had to keep on doing through the game that felt like it was unnecessarily added to the room as filler. The game is weird in that there isn't really that much to do in the game in general, so an individual person will probably contribute exactly one key insight since most of the puzzles are based on observation. This probably is worth checking out for escape room enthusiasts simply due to the premise and novelty of the room, but I imagine that if the idea catches on and more companies starting doing rooms like this (which is honestly not super likely to happen due to the additional cost needed to make this work) then this will end up being a more average experience."
"Escape room ""Popstar's Room of Doom"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-room-popstars-room-of-doom,2,"We did the Pop Star's Room of Doom. This is not the escape room for people who love puzzles and the traditional escape room experience. This room is for people who like the sleuthing aspect of escape rooms, can think on their feet, want an interactive experience and want to try a new take on an escape room experience.  I would not do this room with more than 4 people as there is definitely a logjam aspect inherent to the room where you will be doing nothing waiting for something to happen frequently if you have more people. I would rate this room medium to high difficulty level. Bring a lot of people who are super observant with you! MILD SPOILERS:- the actors in the room were so fun and great at improvising as they interacted with us with their snarky responses. I loved this part of the room the most.- the room left a few of us twiddling our thumbs but I don't know a way around this because of the way the puzzle is structured. Nevertheless, we enjoyed wasting time just using our thinking caps in those moments.- I find the structure and planning for this room so creative and intricate, I really admire the planning that must have gone into engineering this experience.- I like how the actors did not try to mislead us with red herrings and drag out the time which some other rooms try to do. - the hinting system may be tough for those who want hints on command, but we found it worked fine."

"Escape room ""Hero League"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-hero-league,0,"Have done over 20 Escape Rooms in the Tampa Bay area (Because once you've done one you just HAVE to do more, am I right?) and Outerlife Studios is our top pick. All three of their rooms have blown our minds with the brilliant mechanics and completely different ideas. Some escape rooms lead you from lock to lock to lock, but Outerlife has very clever puzzles that make the experience very immersive.Their newest room Hero League DRAT has some very ingenuous use of space. Any hesitation about it being a ""mobile"" escape room instantly dissipated as soon as my team and I stepped in. This is very well another top notch addition to their other two rooms and can't recommend it enough.Now, what makes outer life even greater is their staff, we have loved geeking out with their team, they are warm, welcoming and engaging, and really make us want to come back for more (hurry up and make more rooms ASAP, please). It doesn't hurt that its also a great location near central ave with fantastic walking distance to plenty of drinking and dining options nearby for you to debrief with your team.TLDR, one of the best escape rooms experiences in Tampa Bay. If you've done their previous two rooms, come do their third one, you will not regret it at all."
"Escape room ""Hero League"" by Outerlife Studios in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/outerlife-studios-hero-league,1,"As a huge fan of Outerlife Studios, I was definitely curious about their new mobile escape room, Hero League/D.R.A.T (Destructive Roaming Armored Transport). I’ve done many escape rooms (some even international) and have had a wide range of experiences and each time Outerlife still is at the top of my list.First off, the owners are really cool, chill people who clearly love doing this. They love to debrief after and love seeing people excited after exiting their rooms. Each room has an element you don’t expect, so win or lose you’ll have a blast in each room.So with our prior experience with Outerlife in mind, we were curious to see how this new Hero League D.R.A.T. room would be.Overall, we were over the moon happy and loved the whole experience! If I could erase my brain and do it again I happily would.The story was well thought out and the acting in the videos added to your excitement. The technology was excellent and really immersed you further into the story. I can say one aspect of this room had us absolutely floored had to do with the color green - when you do the room you’ll understand.The puzzles flowed well and added to the story and everything made sense - sometimes a pet peeve of mine is when you have to solve a puzzle for no reason. Not a single key with locker lock in the whole room, which is exciting for anyone tired of endless find-the-key-and-correct-lock of many other escape companies.The puzzles also requires a good bit of teamwork which is really fun and had us giggling with excitement the whole time. We had a team of 6 and we never felt cramped or in each other’s way which I was definitely wondering about when we first got in. It was surprisingly spacious.Overall, I was extremely impressed with this room and would say Outerlife continues to stand as the best escape company in the Tampa Bay Area. I loved Disarm and Scorched and can definitely add the new Hero League D.R.A.T. room to that list. Now I have to wait for the next room to come out ...."

Jeff, the manager, excused this as not having booked exclusive and claimed his staff has a memorized script for booking parties so that this can be explained to persons. But he could not provide the script. Two children were hurt in the games. Several children cried. They lost all except the last game. This is NOT what you want for your child on his/her birthday. If you want family-friendly laser tag, go to the Ice Sports Forum instead."

Definitely a tough room, but nothing short of amazing! I'd recommend to anyone!I just wasn't sure what the storyline was. When we got there, the initial employee that introduced us to the waivers and instructional video was great - but then we got passed off to another guy who brought us to the wrong room at first and I don't know if we were explained the whole story when we got to the correct one. Then when we asked for the first clue, they gave us a clue for a wrong room. Luckily I recalled their mix up earlier and clarified if they were giving a clue for World Of Illusions, and they acknowledged that they gave us the wrong walkie (which wasn't even synced to the 1st room they put us in; it was for the 3rd room).When we solved the room - there was no fanfare. And as we left, there's no enthusiasm. We totally forgot to take a photo too for escaping - I wish there was more excitement when we escape and then a reminder to take a photo. Maybe there would be if we didn't use hints.I just can't wait to go back and play the other rooms because the tricks and locks and clues are high tech and wonderful. They missed the mark on creating a seamless experience start to finish though."

"Escape room ""Masquerade Manor"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-masquerade-manor,2,"This is the BEST escape room I have gone to. The rooms were very detailed, high tech, clean, and very thought out. The hints do not cost you time and are very clear without giving away what to do. The game masters were very present and considerate, we never waited very long for a response. My group was small so we were paired with another couple. They ensured that things would be fair and made sure we knew one person from their group (2 people) had to agree to a hint before they gave one. They were very welcoming from start to finish, they don't rush you at any point. I highly recommend visiting them! They have 2 locations. You will not regret it! P.S. photos are of their waiting room with puzzles and some awesome seating. They have intricate brass chandeliers too that are very pretty."

"Escape room ""Star Trek: Discovery VR"" by Sandbox VR in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/sandbox-vr-star-trek-discovery,0,"I'm a longtime VR enthusiast and have been following the ups and downs of the industry for years. Unfortunately, VR has been a disappointment and I've been waiting for someone to bring great hardware and content together, and give me a reason to believe again. Enter, Sandbox VR.They call themselves a ""holodeck"" so, as a Star Trek purist, my expectations are sky high. I better feel like I'm knee deep in a Klingon swamp or spending a weekend in Risa with some lovely green ladies, or else I'll be disappointed.Well, after playing BOTH Sandbox experiences, I can say that my mind is completely BLOWN. It's by far the best VR experience I've had to date, especially if you're used to being a floating head on a disorienting roller coaster demo. This is NOT that. You move in the environment with your pals as perfectly mapped, MOCAP'd characters so there's no sense of feeling dizzy. The haptics make it feel like those zombies are really about to eat my face! It's practically an otherworldly experience that you have to see the believe.While there's currently a limited amount of content that's focused primarily on horror/survival themes, it's only a matter of time before we can take a pilates class or travel beyond the stars in VR. I, for one, came to play. Bring it on Sandbox!"

"Escape room ""Oracle Mystery"" by SUBScape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/subscape-games-oracle-mystery,0,"The second room we did was Oracle Mystery.  I would say this room is intermediate difficulty.  It's gypsy/supernatural themed, but I wouldn't consider it scary.  This room was definitely more challenging.  I enjoyed this room.  It took us a minute to figure out where to start, and the puzzles in this room required more thinking.  We did require a hint for this room.  "

We had the room to ourselves with our family. The kids really enjoyed the challenge as well. Just make sure you ask if it's kid friendly if you plan on bringing your kids."

The monologues and songs performed were great and I was even surprised that the actors stayed in character the whole time. This location turns into an actual bar at a certain hour where patrons can come and be merry without doing an escape room."

"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,0,"The Quest is an excellent fantasy escape room with the perfect combination magic and analogue that ultimately creates an immensely satisfying experience that should not be missed. The set is a wonderfully earthy abode filled with magical odds and ends waiting to be uncovered and utilized, each serving a very realistic magical experience. The puzzles are equally brilliant and have multiple tracks running at once, with enough variety and challenge to keep everyone engaged. The workers, one of which functioning as an in-game and in-character gamemaster, are kind, helpful, and obviously very devoted to the wondrous game they have created. This is not a game to miss if you are in the area."
"Escape room ""The Quest"" by Escape Goat in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escape-goat-the-quest,1,"The Quest is our favorite escape room that we've ever done. The beautiful space feels mostly ""The Hobbit"", but the puzzle-solving made us feel more like Hagrid or Newt Scamander from the Harry Potter world. This was the hardest of the three; I'd recommend trying the others first so you can get to know the minds of the puzzle creators. However, we did this one first and still just made it out, asking for a little more help from the game master than we would have preferred."

I loved all of Escape Goat's previous games, and was sad to see 221B go, but The Quest is absolutely phenomenal. While 221B was a very logic puzzle-based escape room, The Quest is less so. There are still plenty of puzzles to solve, but they're a different kind of puzzle.The scenic in this room is incredible and I can't stop thinking about all of the unique and interesting puzzles. There were plenty of ""AHA!"" moments which can be the most satisfying part of an escape room experience. It's no secret that Escape Goat is one of my favorite escape room businesses of all time."

"Escape room ""Operation: Santa's List"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-operation-santas-list,0,Solid escape room.  The themes were thoughtful and relatively well done.  I did two here.  The seasonal Christmas theme was good for the kids but you can tell was not as well integrated into the puzzles.  I find the best escape rooms integrate the puzzles into the story or logic of the escape in such a way that one does not feel like one is doing a puzzle just for the puzzles sake or just to get to the next puzzle.  It really does feel like you are solving a mystery and are performing some deductions and detective work.  The Santa Operations felt like one puzzle after another.  Still the kids had fun.  I have done one of the other staple Escape Rooms and felt like it was well done.  Definitely worth doing with friends or the family.  This is a well run escape room company and serves the customers well.  The staff was friendly.

"Escape room ""The Dynasty - Royal Library"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-iteration-royal-library,0," This is my first escape room and it was fun! I came here in a group of 6 and we tried the Royal Library room (first room). Everything there had a purpose and required us to be very resourceful! We could work on multiple puzzles at once so if we couldn't figure one out right away, we could always focus on the other. We barely got frustrated/stuck for a long time and used 2 hints in the first room. There are also some pretty cool tech things/mechanics and some things could be deceiving! Also, I really like how the rooms have some sort of storyline - I think it becomes more interesting.Solving the first room led us to the Alley (second room) and we used our remaining time from the 1 hour time limit to explore/solve things. I think the transition from the library to alley was the most frustrating part because only 2 people could work on the puzzle (very clever but took too long and I had nothing to do) to get us all into the second room. But that second room was actually really pretty. I actually came back with a different group of friends to try the 2nd room, but I thought the first room's puzzles were better (2nd room was also crowded).I would suggest using up all your remaining hints to get as far as you can on your second room because we wouldn't have completed the second room given the amount of time we had left - but perhaps we could've gotten farther. Also, don't play with the pocketwatch they lend you because I accidentally stopped it and couldn't tell how much time I had left OOPS :P Finally, a huge thanks to the guy working there.

This is my first time at an escape room. I had never even heard of the concept before this. My husband and I had so much fun playing the Royal Library. We were the only ones who reserved the 5pm timeslot on Friday evening and we got done solving everything before time ran out. You get 1 hour which is a good amount of time. There were a lot of interesting things to find and the puzzles were really tricky and fun to solve. I loved the special effects and the super powers you need to use to unlock hidden objects to reveal the clues. Cool use of technology! I would highly recommend trying it out.

"Escape room ""It's a Holodeck Mr. Holmes"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-its-a-holodeck-mr-holmes,0,"We played the Sherlock Holmes Holodeck game. What is not to like? Sherlock with a twist of Star Trek can never be a bad thing. The puzzles were straightforward but difficult enough. We had a bit of problem at times, but Eric the clue master gave just the right amount of hints. The explanation at the end really made it seem like we were in a whodunnit. This is our second escape room, and in this one the plot was as important and satisfying as the puzzles which I appreciated.  Two of us solved the game in 54 minutes... with a little blind luck:) Do it. I recommend it highly."

I think this is a great deal for the price and I will definitely plan to do more of their rooms.  A bonus was that this is located in a beautiful old home on the historic register and it was just a pleasure to be there.  They also had some puzzles in the lobby to keep us busy while we were waiting for our start time.

"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,3,"I did the Secret Temple room with 7 other people for a friends bday party.  It was $25 each.  It was definitely a fun activity, but it wasn't as logic, puzzle-solving centered as I expected.  There was more trial and error and a little randomness involved.The man and woman that greeted us were fun, nice and engaging.  The guy continued on to monitor us in the room and was helpful (with clues) when we needed it.  Obviously this whole operation was set up and is run by some fun & creative people.  I see in some of the other reviews people mentioning an actress, but maybe we didn't get that far?!  I would definitely try a different room or other escape activity but didn't love this one.  It was a little more frustrating than it was fun in retrospect because I think that specific puzzle needed a main clue to bind all the random stuff together (maybe as a hint, they could reveal another framed clue that would give you an idea of what move you need first instead of the monitor giving verbal clues).  I'm not going into any detail so as not to give anything away.I also think a few details would make the room aesthetically a lot more cooler and make you feel like you are actually in a secret temple room.  There was laminating (which I get makes things last longer but just printing out new little papers seems worth it to heighten the experience) and labels/stickers that kind of took you right out of the secret temple and into Staples. lol.  I'd rate this experience a 3.5 but since everyone else's reviews are so high and it was worth trying, I don't want to lowball!  I'm curious to try the Apt. 205 room since people seem to love that one!"

On our first visit we were not able to solve The Secret Temple - it left us scratching our heads and more determined to complete a room. We came back to try Apartment 205 and solved it. We had so much fun we had to try the Temple again... Second time was a charm and we were able to solve it too... with clues from the secret society of course ;-) we can't wait for room three.

Lots and lots of surprises.I love how they have a narrator with you who's a really good actress. You can ask for a hint which i suggest, would be really helpful to get out.Online booking was great, they have a really good website, easy to navigate and great price!

"Escape room ""Chemical Lab"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-chemical-lab,0,Probably the hardest of the Lock Down rooms as of Nov. 2018. My wife and I have done 50+ rooms and solved this room with only 2 minutes to spare. Better played with 3-5 players. The immersion was realistic. Perfect mix of modern and unique traditional elements nicely themed. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and polite. They were very accommodating with the booking process. The game master was tracking our progress carefully and gave hints promptly. Can’t say enough about this company and their rooms!

"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,0,"My least favorite panic room i’ve ever done. We got stuck on an early puzzle, and did not understand it even after the lady in the room was trying to show us. There was no way to move forward, and so we were stuck for 40 minutes (as all puzzles are sequential). We got told the answer only 3 minutes before the end, and so had no way to see the rest of the room. Also, the puzzles were not really related to the theme."
"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,1,We just did the Primal Quest room and loved it. We had very little experience with doing escape rooms but were able to figure out most of the clues with only a little help. We really enjoyed our experience and will be coming back. One major advantage is that you can book a room for only two people and not have to be combined with another group. We did fine with just the two of us.
"Escape room ""Primal Quest"" by PanIQ Room in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/paniq-room-prehistoric,2,I was part of a group of 6 where none of us have done a puzzle room like these before.

Loved it so much! We were 3 people and worked well; one experienced his first time with us and was an awesome puzzler himself! Wish we had more time! I'd have loved for us to try the other 2 rooms. We succeeded in 36 minutes and 53 seconds. I highly recommend it and love that any booking was for your own group, no extras. I highly 5 stars recommend it."
"Escape room ""Wizard’s Academy"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-wizards-academy,0,"Highly entertaining, fun time!! We brought a group of 13 year-old boys here for a birthday party (7 kids and 2 adults). The kids escaped but the Wizard's Academy wasn't designed just for kids. The puzzles were weren't overly easy nor were they too challenging to figure out with a little time, teamwork or a hint. The kids finished with only 40 seconds to spare and the adults weren't feeding them advice! We were right there with them playing along! Andrew was our Clue Master and helped make it a great experience! He was on call to move us along when needed it and was enthusiastic about making sure we would have a great time! We're looking forward to going back with a group of friends to see how we'd fare without the assistance of a pack of 13 year-old boys!!"

"Escape room ""Wizard’s Academy"" by Epic Escape Game in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/epic-escape-game-wizards-academy,2,"Outstanding room, tied for my favorite of all time. I've done probably 25-30 escape rooms. This is absolutely top knotch. We did the Wizard Academy. The puzzles are unique, many of them part if the environment itself, and the decoration puts you immediately into the mindset of a wizard. Unlike other escape rooms the premise was relevant and informed the storyline of the game. It wasn't just opening random locks for no reason, it made sense. Eric was an epic cluemaster! Helpful hints at the right times. Made for a great game."
"Escape room ""Mafia Heist"" by EscapeX Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapex-rooms-mafia-heist,0,Mafia Heist was a totally immersive experience with the Speak Easy decor and inventive puzzles and clues!!

"Escape room ""The Alchemist"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-alchemist,1,"We were a group of ten for my friend's birthday and everyone really enjoyed themselves. We did the Alchemist and enjoyed the puzzles and the room setup, staff, and easy parking. It is downtown, but it was fine. Definitely worth the money for the uniqueness, creativity, and knowledgeable staff. Everyone agreed it was worth it for something special."
"Escape room ""The Alchemist"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-alchemist,2,Did the Alchemist room. It was awesome. I have done escape rooms before and they were cheesy. This was one awesome. I highly recommend it.
"Escape room ""Dragonborne"" by Lara's Labyrinth in Hartford",https://worldofescapes.com/west-hartford/quests/laras-labyrinth-dragonborne,0,The best escape room I’ve ever done. So immersive. A must do. Some unexpected things will happen when you step inside. 
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,0,"The room was pretty well done although I thought it was a little too dark. We did have a flashlight and a lantern, though. The puzzles were a little too easy (all of us had only done one or two rooms before). I wish the timer appeared in all of the rooms, but it was only visible in the first room. We could only communicate to the game master through a walkie talkie, which was unexpected. Sometimes it was a little challenging to understand them. I think the room used its space well, and we only ever felt too crowded in the first room (with 6 people). We did end up finishing with over 20 minutes. I think everyone still had a good time. "
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,1,We did the Wild West room on a double date and it was so much fun! We were talking about it the rest of the weekend. We can't wait to go back and try another challenge.
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,2,"THIS WAS AWESOME! My husband, mom (visiting from out of town) and I did this on a free evening we had together because we had all heard of escape the rooms and wanted to do one. We wanted to do this as a bonding activity but also because all three of us enjoy good challenges. Typically, my mom and my husband are competitive and I'm the one telling everyone ""it's only a game, calm down!"" However, by the end, I was cursing (I don't curse) and getting frustrated as a completive side I never see in myself was coming out. We failed the room, going over our 60 minute time by 3 minutes or so. It IS challenging doing the room with only 3 people (as it says on their website) partially because there were times when my husband and mother were solving a clue in one part of the room and meanwhile I was trying to solve a clue on my own in the other corner. Time is of the essence and the more minds working together, the better. However, it is by no means impossible to do this with only two or three people.We did the Wild West room and we felt like this was a good challenge level for us since this is our first escape room (we've heard that at PanIQ, the Kidnapping room is the most challenging with the Alien room being a close second). We would have finished the room in time (I imagine) but we didn't realize it was ""okay"" to ask for hints. Although the lovely woman working there told us we could, we figured that a) that was ""cheating"" and b) we were going to escape this room ourselves, gosh dernit! In the future, we will phone in a few times and ask for hints...! So again, this location is not ""too tough"" to complete as some other puzzle rooms I've seen reviews of in the Phoenix area. They want you to have fun! We will definitely be coming back with more family and friends in the future. It was SUCH a blast! We will be talking about this for a long time afterward."
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,3,Sooooo much fun. Got locked up in the Wild West room with my brothers and dad (all adults) and it was challenging enough to make it entertaining but not so challenging that we were frustrated. Can't wait to go back and try another room.
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,4,"What a unique experience. My brother got locked up with his wife (a great idea, btw), and I got to save her (and him). Da da da da! We were the heroes! We asked if we could leave him, but just like the forest: ""Pack it in, pack it out...don't litter"". The staff was friendly and considerate. We needed a LOT of clues! It really requires community and communiction-which the world needs more of. It was good, wholesome, and great fun. Thanks, PANIQ Room Phx!!!"

The time seem to pass quickly as we were racing the against the clock to solve the series of puzzles that would enable us to escape. I thought it was great! Especially with friends. Would be fun to do with a group of friends, family or team building for work. Grab a coupon and go check it out. Now I want to try all the rooms!"

It definitely adds to the creepiness of the room. Unfortunately, our group did not escape Blaine's Basement (because we were so terrified of the darkness in the room). But when we told our other friends to do it, they escaped and loved it. One of our favorites rooms in all of Arizona.Definitely recommend their ""Quest for the Throne"" and ""Condo"" rooms also.

The room itself was not as interesting of a setting as other puzzle rooms we've done, but the puzzles were better and more challenging. They required thought and there was enough things going on that you could all be doing something different and not crawling on top of each other. Because of this I enjoyed this place more then the others we have gone to."

(our personal favorite of the four). This escape room has elements that i have never experienced before in a room and a finale that has such a great completion. Just to note there are some dry ice effects in the latter part of the game (and may be able to be disabled upon request). This game would be great for new players and I think there are elements that younger players will appreciate/enjoy a lot. "

The hints made the game more exciting and throughout the entire time, I never lost that excitement factor that the game provided. Shout out to James for being an amazing game master/host.

It was difficult enough to seriously challenge all of our puzzle solving skills, but easy enough to where none of us became frustrated. They have clues that help you progress in the story, and clues that are meant to distract you - there are a couple really cool moments that no one expected and I can only imagine how funny it would be to rewatch all of our reactions! It's family owned and the people were so kind and helped us feel comfortable. Thank you Escaped in Time for an awesome family bonding experience!"

"Escape room ""The Assassins"" by Escape Room Salinas in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-salinas-the-assassins,2,"Was here this Saturday for a work team building exercise.  This was my first time doing an ""escape room"" event. There was no wait and it was not busy, but then again we made an appointment for 11am.  They have a large waiting area and water bottles for sale for a dollar. We were a group of 10 but we were broken up into two groups of 5.  My group did the Assassin themed escape room and we had an hour to escape.  I have to say it was fun albeit the puzzles were challenging (so many locks!).  The room we were in was nicely decorated to the theme, and it had a nice ""creepy"" ambiance to it to set the mood.  I don't want to say too much and give it away, but overall it was nicely done. The owner is nice, and she also provides up to three hints if you get stuck.  The only downside is that they have a small parking lot.  I recommend carpooling especially if you are a big group like mine.I definitely recommend this place if you love solving puzzles with friends/family and/or as a team building exercise.  We definitely learned teamwork and how to quickly share ideas to get the task done.  It is too bad that I am not close by to Salinas because I would like to come back here again to do the other themes."
"Escape room ""Unlock The 80’s"" by Amelia Island Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/amelia-island-escape-rooms-unlock-the-80s,0,"After playing 50+ escape rooms throughout TN, GA, and the Carolinas and working at an escape room for 1.5 years, Amelia Island Escape’s “Escape the 80s” Room was my FAVORITE escape room I’ve completed yet.The set dressing was phenomenal, specifically for a locally owned in-house design. The dollhouse created by the owner was absolutely breathtaking (I do hope she’ll decide to encase the small rooms with a glass or acrylic barrier - the incredible attention to detail made me so nervous, as I know how easy it is for customers to get excited and forget what NOT to touch!) The variety of puzzle types was so impressive. Often, escape rooms are bogged down by repetitive puzzle types (translations, object-counting, etc) but this room had such unique puzzles, all perfectly woven into the logical storyline of the adventure itself. If you’re visiting Amelia Island and either enjoy escape rooms or are considering trying one for the first time, this adventure is well-worth the cash and, despite only lasting one hour, will give you something to talk about for the rest of the day!"
"Escape room ""Unlock The 80’s"" by Amelia Island Escape Rooms in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/amelia-island-escape-rooms-unlock-the-80s,1,"This room was the most challenging we have tried. You have to solve a room to get into the room! Wow that was great! It was a blast from the past for My oldest and myself. We were distracted by the 80's memorabilia in the room, so the younger ones really came to the game! This is our 3rd room and we plan on booking the last one to test our mental capacity. The Escape rooms are so much fun for the whole family or just a group of friends. Try it, you'll get hooked too!"

My group of 4 did both Amnesia and Resurrection. These rooms are absolutely amazing. Quest rooms production value is the best of the best. They did a great job utilizing the actor sparingly in the room which I much prefer than having them standing over your shoulder the whole time. These are must do rooms no matter what your escape room experience is. They have set the bar even higher!
"Escape room ""Resurrection"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-resurrection,1,Incredible!!!

This is a big disappointment. When we asked for help, the lady didn't know which stage we finished. No one guided us along to help us finish. This is why it has so many bad reviews that no one finished. In all the escape rooms I have been to, the guide made sure we didn't spend a lot of time on one thing to make sure we finished the mission. We expected it to be scary. It was far from scary. The decoration was awful. There was too many locks. It wasn't creative at all. You are basically opening locks the whole time. Will never come back again. Not worth the money, not a great experience. Go to another escape room. This is an honest review. "

After that we did the Mustache Thief and NAILED IT with 15 min to spare! It was so fun! The Dorm of the Dead was fantastic, there were two other people with us in the room and a group of four was perfect! The design and set surprises were so amazing! Someone put a lot of time into the design! It blew us away! Because the Dorm of the Dead is the 2nd hardest and it was our first time I think we would have nailed it if we had done the mustache one first because we would have known a bit more what to expect.. But then again they are about the same difficulty and they are designed so differently.. We were in a group totaled up of 8 for the mouse ache thief and we had so much fun! We were cheering every clue we unlocked, laughed a lot and had so much fun working as a team! I can't wait to find more room escape games in the country! This is a must do!

I can't wait to go back and try the easier room to really get the understanding of the room.

You’ll have 3 major hints that you can use throughout the game, and depending on location, you might have a screen to prompt occasional clues as time goes on or the attendant will be there for basic questions.

"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,0,"I'm the Owner of Escape Game Alaska and regarding Julie's review, I just want to share this because I clearly remember the two of them as customers. I would never feel the need to write this but I do feel that, as business owners, we live in a world where customers are able to review us but we, as business owners, are not given the opportunity to respond. While I am grateful to have customers play and avidly try to make it through the game, I also need to ensure that my prop decor, investments in making the rooms authentic and detailed, and game pieces do not get damaged- so that other players can play the game as well. During the game, it was clear that there was not a lot of respect for the facility or objects in the game room. (NOTE: some of the books in the rooms are antiques that were gifted to us with the intent of us caring for them; I intend to uphold that responsibility. As well, if a game piece is damaged, it can impact the game experience of people who are scheduled to play following that game). During game play, I observed the two of them dropping and damaging items in the room, kicking gaming pieces with their feet to move them after they'd dropped them on the floor and walking on top of materials. This is not how many of our participants and visitors play. While it may have appeared that I was ushering them out of the room with the intent of going to lunch; I did not go to lunch (despite the fact that I'm quite sure many other humans do)- I just didn't want to have them play any other games especially not our Gold Rush room which is stocked with many items that are over 110 years old. Regarding the difficulty of the game, while experienced gamers may make it out with time on the clock, there are still a lot of players in our area that have never played a game before and we work to ensure that all gamers escape. Our escape games are different (we note that 'everyone escapes' on our website) and we think that people enjoy the positive experience. While we can't please everyone, we do think preservation of the experience for other players is more important than allowing our games to be damaged for solely two people. While input is always appreciated, as business owners, we weigh out cost and benefit on a regular basis. It was my decision that it was potentially more costly to have the two of them play another game than it was beneficial. As well, if our experience was so bad, I'm not sure why the two of them asked to play another game. "
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,1,"The game itself was enjoyable, if shorter than we were used to. My sister and I got out with 20 minutes to spare and we looked through every inch of space in the room (which, for anyone that’s done a hard escape room before, is the trademark of an experienced team. You have to go through everything to avoid missing an “obvious” clue). The woman running the show was the reason for the bad review. She had her boyfriend stop in before we entered the room and told him that after she was finished here that they could grab food. She’s allowed to have a personal life, sure, but shooing customers out the door after they beat the game saying she has “a thing to do” is just unprofessional. We told her that we had an interest in doing another game (there were no bookings after us) and she told us that she it was doable with 2 people, but she “would rather not have [us] in that room because *this* (gestures around to the scattered items of the room) can’t happen in that room”...it was extremely rude. Then she went on to complain about how LONG it’s going to take her to clean up and that she’s never seen this level of “disaster” in the room before. The staff was unprofessional and I’ve never felt the need to leave a scathing review for anyone. Ever. Feel free to enjoy the game itself, but don’t get in the way of the employee’s free time..."

The waiting area is very clean and nicer than most of the other escape rooms I've done. The manager, Stephanie, was very kind and friendly. "
"Escape room ""Secrets of the Illuminati"" by Puzzle Workshop in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/puzzle-workshop-secrets-of-the-illuminati,2,"My inner Robert Langdon and Indiana Jones would be proud. The Illuminati Escape Room was really straightforward and needless to say, the four of us escaped. PLOT: you are trapped in an office trying to steal a valuable Egyptian statuette and you need to escape before the Illuminati overlords come back.The clues, puzzles, tech, storyline were all so much fun and very well done. They were diverse, challenging and more importantly a lot of fun to solve. We were constantly busy! There is a staff member monitoring your progress, who gives out hints (unlimited) if you really need them. When we arrived, we were greeted by Stephanie who was really kind, helpful, and super sweet! Overall, this is probably the funnest escape room that I've ever encountered and I can't wait to try out their second room!"
"Escape room ""Missing from the Speakeasy"" by Escape Hunt in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/escape-hunt-miami-missing-from-the-speakeasy,0,"The headline dancer from an illegal speakeasy has vanished, and it’s up to you to find her!We really enjoyed this room. The quest to find a person lent itself to some creative twists and turns with an engaging story line. Unlike Blackbeard, this room was very linear and we always had a very clear sense of what we should do next and why we were doing. Great production design, clear and fun puzzles, and we’re of course always suckers for a good speakeasy.The one thing against the room is that it may be almost too easy for experienced escape room players. We blew through it in about 30 minutes, but they told us that most people don’t. Don’t discount it though if you’re an old hand at this. We still had fun, and we think it would be a great room for a group starting out on escape puzzles."

We did the WWII room and would recommend it to anyone. Even though we didn't ""escape"" and solve the clues in time we still had a blast. This is totally worth the money for a fun night out with friends, family, or co-workers. They even let us walk through the rest of the clues after time ran out so we could still see what we would have gotten to if we didn't run out of time. We really liked that aspect."

After you sign in they brief you on all of the rules and give you the story set up for your room. Then they walk you to your room and its time to escape. Actually ""escape"" is a bit of a misnomer, its not really about escaping, its about solving the puzzle. I didn't feel ""trapped"" and there was nothing scary, which is a good thing for a claustrophobic haunted house baby like me. I don't want to spoil anything about the puzzle but I will say that it was just difficult enough that it never felt overly frustrating and that my wife and I had an absolute blast solving it along with the other couple in our group.

It was definitely one of the more challenging rooms we have done, so first timers may want to check out some other escape rooms first.  But for those with a few escape rooms under their belt, Gangster's Gamble is a must."

"Escape room ""Under Pressure"" by Escapology Huntsville in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/escapology-huntsville-under-pressure,0,"We did Under Pressure. It was fun, although we didn’t finish! Our screen went black during our time so that was kind of an inconvenience, and we weren’t offered anything for it. It also would have been nice to start with a clue. We wasted over 15 minutes of our time trying to figure out where to start, and most escape rooms start you out with a clue. Overall it was fun! A little pricey Versus others, but fun!"

"Escape room ""DreamWeaver"" by Breakout's Imagine Escape Rooms in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/imagine-escape-games-dreamweaver,0,"We make at least one trip a year from NC to FL and ALWAYS visit Imagine. We were excited to try their newest foray into their serial unfolding storyline: Dreamweaver. We also had not done the prelude, Alleyway Vigilantes, so did that one 1st. They were both amazing! AV, being their ""introductory"" room was impressive, full of great surprises and puzzles, and a really FUN room! Dreamweaver, being their newest, and hardest, was also excellently executed. Everyone had something to do, and you really felt the time crunch in this one. They had two amazing logic puzzles I ended up working on myself and just had a blast. Our GM, Aaron, provided excellent help and subtle hints when we needed one. He was fun, quirky, and obviously loved working there. Can't wait to the next chapter and our next visit!!"

"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,5,"This was our first time doing an Escape Room. The setup was good overall, but I felt like too many times we had to ""start from scratch"" by finding some obscurely hidden thing, rather than a linear(ish) sequence of logical or related steps. There are some exceptions, like one or two threads in particular that I am thinking of, but overall I felt like it was more ""find random stuff"" than intellectually challenging puzzles. Also, one of the devices had major issues (or our randomly partnered people who were using it all had major issues), which complicated things significantly. I have also gone to Mission Escape, and I would definitely go back there first on the strength of their puzzles and the construction/ordering of the challenges, but I would also certainly come back to Escape the Room as well. Solid, very good, but not the best of what we've been to."
"Escape room ""The Apartment"" by Escape the Room Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-the-room-atlanta-apartment,6,"We went to Escape The Room as part of a Team Outing and we had so much fun! I think this is a great office team building idea. You get to pick one of three themed rooms to participate in. You are locked in the room for 60 minutes, during which time you have to solve the clues that are strategically placed all over the room. The clues are designed to help you ""escape the room"". If you don't solve the puzzle after the 60 minutes is over, you can still exit the room :)You don't get a prize if you get out within 60 minutes, but you do get bragging rights :)This is my first time to try this sort of place though, so I have no comparison with other ""Escape the Room"" places. But it was great nonetheless."

We've completed over 60 escape rooms and have done most of our rooms in Southern California and the set design here definitely stacked up to what we're used to at home! We completed The Path and Grim Stacks Books and Bindings. Out of the two we preferred Grim Stacks because we really enjoyed the puzzles in there a lot more and it had a better overall story. Our two hosts were really nice (sorry I forgot your names!) but they did a great job with their clue system and were kind enough to offer us a same day discount to book a second room which is why we ended up doing Grim Stacks! I would definitely come back to check out there other room just based on set design and our game masters alone. Thanks for hosting us and we will see you next time we're in Boise!

"Escape room ""Chinatown"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-chinatown,0,"Truly a blast! I have only had experience with one escape room before - my office did the whole ""team bonding"" thing. Anywhoo! This time I got a group of friend together and the room/experience by far exceeded the first. A few points to highlight...The room - the room itself was very well done. The decor and space. Something I didn't love about the first escape room was how small and crowded it felt. We did the ""Chinatown"" theme and they did a great job giving a restaurant feel.The clues/ puzzle pieces - what really set this place apart was the clues! Again, comparing it to my last experience, there were far less obvious clues which really made us think and work as a team. More importantly the type of puzzle pieces they engineered were phenomenal and extremely creative. Not to give anything away, but you really have to exercise all options with everything in the room touching, aligning, and pushing. Nothing came too easy with this room! Customer service - the girl who assisted us was polite and sweet. Plus, the few times we did have to ask for hints, she gave us the perfect nudge in the right direction. All in all a great experience. I will defiantly be forming a new team and heading back soon!"
"Escape room ""Chinatown"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-chinatown,1,"Such a great time!  3 of us did the Chinatown Room and it was so much fun! We barely escaped but I think it would have been better if we had a couple more people.  The 3 of us had done a few escape rooms before, but this was by far the most fun. The room was decorated in a way that made you feel like you were really in a restaurant in Chinatown. The owner Greg was also super accommodating as the same afternoon of our reservation we were going to run late. He was really nice and put us in at a later spot, which was still open. He didn't have to do that, so we really appreciate it. Staff was also very nice. The clues were also really helpful when we needed them. Can't wait to come back to do the other rooms!!"

"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,0,This room had the perfect flow and was heavy puzzle-based. Soundtrack was awesome and as you progress through the room it just gets better and better. The last part was probably the best thing ever. It starts off with an FBI kind of vibe and turns into a detective like situation and then you walk into a scary movie right after that. The game master Curtis will give you candy!
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,1,"Had a really fun timeDid the ""Jack the Ripper"" room and found it to be very historically accurate. The puzzles were hard but solvable. Not crazy scary but quite macabre which was great. Strongly recommended!!"
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,2,"These rooms are the real deal! Strongly recommended! The Culver City branch let my fiancee and I play their new ""Jack the Ripper"" room early, and good golly, it was amazing. A wide variety of clever puzzles that are integrated with a full, 3-Act narrative. No puzzles exist ""Just because"". They are all either literally riddles/challenges Jack left behind or direct metaphors for the investigative process. Not only are the puzzles thematically enthralling, they are entirely challenging and creative. Each of them is very different than the others while also containing different thought processes. Some are riddles that require abstract thought, whereas another puzzle may be a straight-forward scavenger hunt that requires a keen eye, curiosity, and thorough investigation. My fiancee and I work together well but also have very different thought processes. To this end, it felt entirely rewarding to split up and apply this, with my interpreting coded messages and her noticing the clues and items I would have never caught onto. So rewarding!As well, the room's hosts are beyond kind and generous. We were provided a walkie talkie that was intended to be used for a limited amount of clues, as well as emergencies.  I can't say enough nice things about this room. It's the real deal. Rooms like this are textbook examples of why Escape Rooms are big and what a unique experience they can provide.Please go try it as soon as you can!"

The coded door to get in is very fun. The waiting area is on the roof of the building and was genuinely stunning to walk into. We did the Genie room because it was the easiest room and there was only the two of us. We ended up making the Top 10 wall. He offered us a promo for a second room and ended up doing The Enchanted Forest immediately after. The Enchanted Forest is beautiful/creepy ambience and a total immersion experience. I loved this room so much. Even the scary features that I did not want to go near. We didn't make the Top 10 wall in this room but that's okay. We talked to the owner about creating the rooms and he was so personable. I can only say good things about this experience. We will definitely be back to try the other two rooms!"

"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/omescape-richmond-sorcerers-sanctum,2,"I've played all 3 rooms at this location (4 if you count the room they discontinued) and they are all good.  I was not a fan of the pirate / treasure themed room, but thankfully they replaced that with a room called Sorcerer's Sanctum, which is their best room yet.  The second best room is The Penitentiary and Omega is a distant third (but still enjoyable).   I would recommend the following head count for these rooms:Sorcerer's Sanctum: 6-10The Penitentiary: 4-6Room Omega: 3-5Sorcerer's Sanctum is the most satisfying of the rooms as the puzzles are straightforward and logical.  Penitentiary has one or two puzzles that make you roll your eyes when you finally get the answer because they just aren't quite fair.  Omega is a smaller room and probably better for people who are very analytical or math oriented.Overall, you really can't go wrong here.  I think this location has two of my all time favorite rooms and it even better than some of the pricier rooms in SF."

I did their ""Pawn Shop"" room, which was lots of fun and I would consider pretty difficult - but in fairness most of the difficulty came from us overthinking the problems.  ;)  It's run by a husband and wife that are very passionate about it - and even go so far as to make the different gadgets in the rooms - any place that casually mentions doing things with Arduino's gets an automatic bonus from me.Overall a great location and a great place to take a date, family or company to do something a bit more memorable an interactive than just going out for drinks or a movie.

Beware of faulty tools. We spent around 10-15 minutes on a single lock. We were extremely confused why it wouldn’t open! Come to find out that the lock was broken!  We did not get our time back And made us question every lock we came across (which were ALOT). The second room we encountered also had a wonky tool that wouldn’t work properly and that also took us around 10-15 minutes to move on. This was to the point we were asked if we needed someone to come in. It is unfortunate because the concepts were cool and interesting and the workers were enthusiastic and friendly. After 2 encounters with a faulty item, it is safe to say we will not be going back here."

The two of us did the Zombie Apocalypse room with another couple that we did not know. First of all, just walking into the building you can tell that they put a lot of thought into the design, the lobby was cool, and they had puzzles for you to do while you waited. Obviously I can't give much away about the room itself, but the attention they put into decorations was great. I've been to a few escape rooms that were fun, but they were really just a plain room with puzzles in it.In the end we got out around 55 minutes!

It really is so much fun! The puzzles are very clever, kind of in the style of a Professor Layton game though obviously it's in the real word. I think this adds to the excitement as you're physically moving around and manipulating objects with the other players. One thing I was a little worried about was we were in a time slot with one other group. This ended up being really fun though, as the game is well set up for collaboration. I'd say the difficulty is just about perfect, as we really were ""SO CLOSE!"" Also, the staff are delightful. I can't wait to try another Real Escape Game!"

Our group missed it by about five minutes; more hints should be shouted by the staff or the fox. Fifteen percent is too low a number. It means they are too hard, especially if those in the room haven't done any game like this before. Would love to see a children's one happen, maybe based on (non brand name) Minecraft or Greek mythology. The history of the game in Japan and Hungary are fascinating. Will recommend to friends."

When I played their time-traveling game""80's Flashback,"" I stepped into a bedroom with vintage teal and green carpet and realized we'd be using a boombox to play an actual cassette tape for a clue. It felt totally tubular to be sleuthing our way through the 80's. Time To Escape's other game transported me to 15th century Transylvania where I solved my way through the castle of Vlad the Impaler. This was the first time I'd ever used scent to solve a puzzle, or encountered props as authentic and unusual as a life size armor statue and historically accurate map of Romania."

We did the Escape from Venus room, the only one that is designed for 2 people. Despite our pathetic performance (we needed multiple hints), we emerged from the room laughing and feeling closer. When it's just 2 people, you are forced to reconcile your differences in how you problem solve in order to escape the room. Given how different we are, had we done the challenge separately, we would've escaped much faster. The next time we do this, we are going to rock at this - at least that's what we tell ourselves!"

My parents had never done an escape room before - mom was skeptical and dad had no interest (""Can I just pay you for my ticket and wait outside?""). We all really had such a ball!!  The room was creative and clever and when we left, my mom just kept saying over and over, ""That was so much FUN!"" then ""That was just SO much fun!""  And now my dad, two days later, still excitedly reminds us, ""How about how I solved the first clue in that escape room!""  We have been to several escape rooms in different cities and this was by far our favorite. My kids declared it their most fun part of all of spring break, and asked for Escape Room birthday parties next year. Will definitely be back next year for spring break!Additional notes:- I was a bit worried about having to do any crawling (we've been in some rooms at other places in the past where we've had to crawl through tight spaces to get from room to room), but they assured us that all their rooms are grandparent friendly!  - I particularly love how they give you a clipboard with paper to work things out - first time we've had that!  - We all commented that there was something for everyone in the room to keep everyone engaged in solving the puzzle.  It was really so thoughtfully designed."

"Escape room ""The Hex Room"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Cross-Roads-Escape-Games-Hex-Room,0,"LOVED this escape room!!When I first received the invite to come along, I thought okay, what is going to set this one apart from the rest? I've been to my share of escape rooms, some were great, others needed to mature a little more, but after you've done so many, you want to find a uniqueness about the next one.I read the concept of everyone starting off separated into different rooms, that really caught my eye. The idea of everyone being a different character based on a quirky personality test was also nice. I had my eye set on being the detective (which I was able to be ). I watched as my friends became elected into the other positions - the jock, the rebel, the nerd, the virgin and the prom queen.To conquer this escape room, you really need the right dynamic. Everyone has their own puzzles to conquer, but at the same time, one may have something for someone in another room. I don't want to spoil much, but I will speak from being the detective. If you find yourself in this spot, I hope you don't get overwhelmed easy. You are the glue that bonds everyone and it is your responsibility to make sure everyone is okay and gets what they need.I highly recommend this room and will be speaking nothing but good things about it to anyone interested. What a great team at Crossroads, I can't wait to see what rooms you all come up with next."

"Escape room ""X-Child"" by Dare To Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dare-to-escape-az-x-child,0,"We've done a lot of escape rooms around the valley, but Dare to Escape's rooms are by far the best! Cult of Mithras and X-Child (which we broke the records on!) utilized the most creative puzzles, riddles, and devices that our group has encountered in AZ. Some of the secrets in the rooms actually left us with a sense of awe and wonder! I'd say the rooms strike the perfect balance between making you think outside the box and communicate with your team while avoiding frustrating, ridiculously-hard and obscure problems that are impossible to solve. Loved the themes of the rooms as well and can't wait to return for The Cell! These are the best escape rooms in AZ that we've encountered and I would definitely recommend them to anyone!"

We did Al Capone's Speakeasy. The addition of an outside character (the bartender) we needed to haggle and negotiate with really differentiated this escape room from others we've done. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a personal and challenging game.
"Escape room ""Al Capone’s Speakeasy 1929"" by Time to Escape in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/time-to-escape-al-capones-speakeasy,2,Had a great time at the Al Capone Speakeasy today!

"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,0,My group of four did both Fogmore Manor and the bayou rooms. These rooms are done really well! We've done a bunch of escape rooms in San Diego and this one is definitely in our top 3 favorite places.  The tech in these rooms are really awesome! They are very challenging which we like but doable. We got trapped in both rooms but we're about a minute away from solving them so the owner let's us finish. The owner is really passionate about his rooms which is really cool. He designed and programmed everything himself which is very impressive. I wouldn't attempt this room with any less than 4 people because it is challenging. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to do an escape room.
"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,1,"We read somewhere that the Entrapment (Bayou Room) was a Top 5 Escape Room in San Diego so we decided to give it a try. We usually have 5 in our group but were missing our 5th this night. We were a tad skeptical upon arrival as their location shares a main entrance way with a car sales & sketchy massage parlor. It also had a strong smell of pets or the bad smell of a public bathroom. Then their guest waiting room was nothing to brag about when compared to the 20+ other escape rooms we've visited...That's where the negative observations stop. Upon entering The Bayou room, it was well designed/decorated, very interactive, and had a lot of variety involved to keep you interested the entire time! It wasn't a typical escape room where you have to open 20 locks to complete the game. Our game master had to inform us we were doing the right thing but gave hints if say something we're doing wasn't lining up quite right to obtain the desired result but this didn't detract from the overall experience. Teamwork is definitely needed as there's lots to do in there! In the end, it turned out to be a very fun yet challenging experience. Give The Bayou room a try if you want something a little different than you're accustomed to! You won't be disappointed."
"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,2,"I did this room when I was on a trip to San Diego last year.It's the best escape room I've ever done. We did the 90 minute Bayou room, and it was AWESOME! I loved how items could be reused and the puzzles were not like not typical and formulaic. You definitely had to think outside the box."
"Escape room ""Pele’s Stone Room"" by Submerged Maui in Maui",https://worldofescapes.com/lahaina/quests/submerged-maui-peles-stone-room,0,We have done a lot of escape rooms and this was a ton of fun. A lot of interesting effects and many things to keep multiple people busy.
"Escape room ""Pele’s Stone Room"" by Submerged Maui in Maui",https://worldofescapes.com/lahaina/quests/submerged-maui-peles-stone-room,1,"My family and I have been to various escape rooms in many different states in the U.S. (at least 10), including one in Wailuku on Maui. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ""ESCAPE ROOM.""   The best escape for you is to escape the temptation to spend any time or money at this location.  The price of $50 pp is you paying for their rent at the Wailea Beach Resort.  Go to Ramen Shop escape room at Mystery Maui.  The Submerged Maui room had some potential and some cool elements but it is clear that they don't know how to properly organize, run and facilitate a successful escape room. Overall, they had a unique concept (i.e. submarine, laser beams, etc.), but unfortunately their clues were shouted through the walls or delivered in person, which we found was extremely unprofessional. Also, the rooms were very dark, not to mention the countdown clock was only present in the briefing room. Sorry to write such a bad review but I wouldn't suggest choosing this particular escape room (especially at that cost)."

Galaxy Quest: more challenging than Krampus. LOVED Cosmo, who gave me as much sass as I gave him. And the little friendly alien, who distracted us for longer than we probably should have been- but he was just so cute! If you like more tech-heavy effects do this one. I recommend at least 3 people if you're just casual escape room fans."
"Escape room ""Galaxy Quest"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-flight-of-the-pandorus,1,"We loved playing Galaxy Quest!!! My 10 year old daughter and I enjoyed the high immersion, the sense of humor, and the sci-fi nature of the room. The puzzles were quirky and fun. I found myself repeating some of the directions because they were useful. It was also important to listen to directions given. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and found we had a lot to do and were fully engaged in either saving the world or destroying it. We did have a couple of tech issues, which honestly, happens in escape rooms in Los Angeles. I've come to expect them, but they didn't take away the joy we had in playing this room. (The only place where we've played escape rooms that have a lot of high tech and did not have any tech issues was in Israel, but the puzzles were not that interesting in the rooms we've played there.) We both enjoyed the puzzles at Galaxy Quest because of the mix and uniqueness.I would highly recommend this room to families of tweens, couples who want to laugh and work together and get to know each other better, and groups of friends looking for a fun, challenging time.There is a parking lot in the back and clean restrooms. The GM and owner, Brian was stellar."

There's a huge free attached parking lot. They have a few different rooms of varying difficulty. We chose the Galaxy Quest room which is by far the hardest room I've ever done. It is very different from many of the other rooms that I've done. 60out is great, and I can't wait to do some of their other rooms."

They do take walk ins but we chose to book online for Wreck It Ralph at 5:15pm on a Friday. We heard Ralph was better than StarWars so we went with it. Check in was easy, staff awesome. It isn't cheap at $29.95. a pop but it is what it is. Once we checked in we saw a tutorial and suited up! All four of us ready to rock. Oh and we picked our avatars. We were all together playing but we had individual scores so we weren't working together per say as a team. It is a trip! So much fun, wish it was longer! We all got a great photo afterwards and even got a short video clip emailed to us. Photo was $15 plus tax and a copy sent to email. Overall the experience was great and the kids had an absolute blast! Must be 10+. We got to keep our avatar card as well as a keepsake. Will definitely do again!"
"Escape room ""Ralph Breaks VR"" by The Void Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/the-void-orlando-ralph-breaks-vr,2,"Me and my husband did the Ralph breaks Internet experience and wow, it was awesome!! What a wonderfully original concept! Employees were friendly and efficient & I would totally go back! My one issue is the cost: $35 for what ends up being 15 minutes of game play is steep. I also didn't appreciate being charged nearly $3 ""per ticket processing fee"" when I paid in store at the cash register. I hate these sneaky ads-on fees, it seems really dishonest not to just raise the price of the ticket so people know exactly how much it's going to cost."

We had an amazing time doing the Prison Break room. It's hard to write a review of such a place, because it's absolutely vital that it remain spoiler-free, so that everyone has a chance to have such a great experience. I can tell you that there were several features of the room that were completely unique, not found in any of the other escape rooms I've visited so far. Each of these was a complete surprise, and added immeasurably to the overall experience. We had a team of 5, and it was one of the few rooms I've played that I think we really needed a good sized group. Usually my girlfriend and I do these rooms just the two of us, but this time, I don't think we could have solved it without at least 2 other teammates. The clues and devices were well hidden throughout the game, and the mechanisms for obtaining some of them were simultaneously logical and innovative. There was, quite literally, a surprise around every corner, and every victory led to more and more puzzles to solve, right up to the very end. We had an absolutely fantastic time, and I can't wait to go back and experience the other rooms at The Escape Game Orlando."

I heard lots of yelling and banging so I was kind of freaking out but it wasn't scary.We did RESCUE which has a 3.3% success rate. We thought we were smart and were going to get out just fine. Even if it was our first one. NOPE! We technically did escape and saved the girl. Just 20 seconds after the bomb went off...as ghosts.

I really had a great time with my 3 coworkers. There was plenty of clues and some really cool props. We were in the speakeasy. The clues were not to hard but not too easy. Great for people who have never done an escape room before and challenging enough for someone who has done an escape room. I would definitely recommend this company.

"Escape room ""Sister's Secret"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-sisters-secret,0,"My previous review was for The Escape (a great room). Now that I've done Sister's Secret, I have to say it's my favorite room I've ever done. Out of 54 rooms, this one was the most immersive I've experienced. Edwin, the owner, has an attention to detail, high quality puzzles, and intriguing story line that all come together perfectly in this room. I was scared, but not to the point where puzzles couldn't be completed. There's just the right amount of cool tech in the room, and it all added to the spooky theme. I'm also a sucker for a story - if you pay attention you will be carried through a movie like storyline from beginning to end. A cool bonus is the lobby has a mini escape room practice game. I highly recommend The Unlockables!"

We tried Sister's Secret- we didn't succeed, but the room was really detailed and well done!I would recommend not doing this room if it's your first time, since it's a little more complicated than The Escape or Informant. I'm going back to try an easier room for the ego boost :)"
"Escape room ""Sister's Secret"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-sisters-secret,2,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon.  My crew and I love escape rooms so this is not our first rodeo.  Place has 3 room, two of them sister secret and the escape are a bit more advanced and technologically involved.  The last one is more of your traditional escape room.  We did sister's secret and it was one of the better escape rooms in terms of atmosphere, challenge and puzzle flow.  For this room you need atleast 3 people and i'd recommend more if some of the people aren't that experienced.  Puzzle complexity is average and they all make sense.  Its perfect for larger groups since it is non-linear (something they tell you at the beginning) so you can all work of different things at the same time.  There are a lot of things to do in this room so its going to be hard if your team doesn't have multiple competent people.The atmosphere of the room is great.  Nice spooky ambience with a few things that go bump in the night.  Really a nice immersive experience with a bunch of fun puzzles."

It definitely felt like we were trying to escape and with a sense of urgency.  VERY realistic!  I've done several escape rooms that felt too fake, not this one!They did something I had never done before.  They take you to the room blindfolded!  You start in the main area where they go over the ""rules"" (standard escape room protocol) and then they give you blindfolds to wear.  You then walk in a line with your hand on each other's back to the room (employee leads of course).  Then you are sat down, door is shut, sounds start, and you take your blindfold off and... ESCAPE!

To start off the staff is very nice and informative if it is your first time, but we didn't need any explaining, so they asked us about our previous experiences doing escape rooms. The puzzles were well thought out and some were elaborate especially from the very beginning, you have to use your head and pay attention to all clues around you. We did use 3 clues to only find out we were already on the right track we just needed reassurance. We escaped with 15 minutes to spare ! They do have one other room at this location called Nautical (remember I'm talking about the one on western). The location might be a little hard to find at first but the sign is on their door. Street parking only, they have meters, or you can park down the side street during certain times around the corner.

LOVED the game it was so fun! The puzzles were tricky but really fun and it was so exciting when you solved them. We had 4 hints we could use during the game, the only frustrating thing about the experience was sometimes the hints were very helpful but then sometimes the hint just told us what we were already doing. Maybe work on better hints but overall it was great! We escaped with a minute left! Last thing, we were placed with a group without knowing. The group was supposed to do an earlier room but missed their time so ended up going in with us. It would've been nice to be asked if that was okay or even just a heads up. Especially when a couple from the group vigorously made out the entire time and were in our way when trying to escape the room. It was uncomfortable and the management watching from the camera didn't even say anything when they visibly saw we were uncomfortable. I know thats a hard situation i just wish it could've been handled somewhat better. Anyways will definitely be back! Loved the game overall!!!!!"

I can't wait to go back and try all of the other rooms that are available. The location is creatively decorated, realistic and you really have to see it to believe it. They did a FANTASTIC job designing The Classroom. It's so easy to get lost in its reality and play the game to win.

"Escape room ""Gravitational Effect"" by International Room Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-gravitational-effect,2,"Gravitational Effect - I think I liked this room better than Amazon Rainforest. They tried to make the room 4D by giving you 3D glasses to enhance the experience but, let's be honest, they're not going to do anything other than make you trip and/or make the puzzles difficult because you can't see them straight. They are not needed to play the game so they are pretty pointless, in my opinion. We didn't even put them on. For the most part, the puzzles made sense and a few were challenging but not overly difficult. There were a couple of puzzles I felt that if they were improved upon they would make the experience more immersive. One of the puzzles involved ""jackets"" which, at first, we thought were just plastic bags. This made the puzzle seem kinda cheesy because they were just cheap rain ponchos that didn't really fit with the room. Perhaps investing in some actual jackets to make it more themed would help spruce up this puzzle some. The other puzzle was the final puzzle. I don't want to give anything away so I won't say anything about it other than it had absolutely nothing to do with the theme of the room. But even with that being said, I do want to say that there was one ""puzzle"" that was more of a physical challenge and that was a lot of fun. It caught us off guard when we saw it (which is almost always a good thing in the world of escape rooms) and we laughed a lot through it. I thought it was great for them to have this in the room and really added a lot to the experience. "

My tip is to not have everyone work on one thing, split up but communicate with each other very well, no matter which room you decide to do.

I chose this one over the other because the premise seemed more technical and the other room was rated as scary, which was a no-go for one of our members. The puzzles were very technical in nature rather than relying heavily on math or word puzzles, which was a huge positive for the room as it fit the theme and every time we solved one we were blown away with the amount of technology that had to have gone into creating the puzzle. Comparing this to my first escape room experience, this escape was far more satisfying and we all can't stop talking about each puzzle and the creativity behind them. I can't wait to try out future rooms that they have in construction."
"Escape room ""Inception"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-inception,2,"My sister in law was in town for her birthday and we decided, spur of the moment, to do an escape room. I wanted to do the inception room because it was rated harder than their other room. The puzzles were a fun mix of physical and more traditional. Some of the physical puzzles were difficult for our group, but I expect that if you or someone in your group is more of a spacial thinker then you probably won't have the problems we did.Inception is a rather tech heavy room, which often feels gimmicky to me. However in the Inception room they used the tech to their advantage really well. It fits the theme and feel of the room superbly.Overall, Inception is an excellent room and is one of the few rooms I've done that actually gets better in my mind the more I analyze it."

My first Escape Room and we made it out.  Super colorful and multi-sensorial.  Staff Guide Theresa was all that to assist if needed.  It was so much more stimulating and challenging than I thought it would be.  Cool to see friend's skills come out.  Can't wait for the next one! "
"Escape room ""The Pyramid"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-pyramid,2,"Just did the newest one of the four choices, The Pyramid, and it's really good. Pretty difficult and we didn't quite finish in time to escape, but it's so well planned and interesting that no one really minded. The design is great and even better than the other rooms - just sorry that we were rushing to finish the clues and I didn't get adequate time to admire the workmanship. Highly recommended! (And if you haven't done one of these before, teamwork is a must - sharing things you've figured out with the others in the group. Don't worry, you'll all quickly become friends if you don't have a full group of your own."

As we joked and stumbled our way through the riddles and lore, we chased a few too many red herrings on our exciting journey toward eventual defeat. Even the insights of my six year old (who was sometimes helpful!) did not allow us to 'defuse the bomb and save the world' in time.While frustrating, no game worth playing lets everyone win. Would I recommend it? Hell yeah! If you have a couple of clever friends and want something fun to do . . . or maybe even looking for the perfect double date activity to go along with dinner then absolutely: go for it.Can you prevail where 5 Corleys came up short?

They also have some fun board games in the lobby you can play before or after. Also, this spot is right next to Player One, a video game bar!

They are positive, enthusiastic, and genuinely seem happy to be working there.Definitely do this new room and if you haven't had the pleasure of doing the other rooms here, they have a twofer Tuesday special for their older rooms."

Did the Tony's Bistro room and had a blast. The room felt very realistic and the clues that we were lead through were just enough - not hard/to the point where it was impossible, but rather involved the right amount of thinking.

I realized American escape rooms are so much different than China.Get back to this escape room. I came here by friend's recommendation. We tried the ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" it was really hard for us. There are so much details in the game that we have to remember and pay some attentions on it at the same time. And remember! Team work, team work, and team work! I felt I went to the gym after play this game. So tired but it was fun.I really recommend you to play this with your close friends since you have to do something together and yelling to each other's for those clues."
"Escape room ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-a-wrinkle-of-wormhole,1,I went there for my friend's birthday party. It was so fun. We played the Wrinkle of Wormhole. and get out of there in the last minutes. I played a few escape rooms in the bay area. So far this is the most challenging one. The room was dark and we have to interact in several different rooms at the same time. I love the story that a prodigy created the time machine and the last part was awesome. Unfortunately we cannot take a photo in there but it was so pretty. Base on the other reviews the other rooms are not that good but I'll definitely give a try.
"Escape room ""A Wrinkle of Wormhole"" by That Escape Room in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/that-escape-room-a-wrinkle-of-wormhole,2,I recommend to try the wormhole game. That game has a difficult logic in it. Players have to travel between two years to make things right. There were a lot of things to do and my testing team finished in 57:58. That was a completely different experience.

"Escape room ""Escape the Mad Hatter"" by Ryptic Room Escape in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/ryptic-room-escape-escape-the-mad-hatter,0,"This is a ""revolving-door"" style escape room. Your team gets five minutes in a small room with a single puzzle. After five minutes, you're moved to another room regardless of whether you've solved your puzzle or not. There are four rooms total, and you get two chances to solve each room. That means you have a total of ten minutes in each room. If you fail to solve a room after your second try, you'll be unable to escape.The revolving door style lets it boast an impressive player count (24 players?), because different teams can use different rooms in parallel without having to see each other. But it's extremely jarring to be moved from one room to another before you've solved a puzzle, to be moved back into a room that you've half-completed after solving three other unrelated puzzles, or to have solved three out of four puzzles and have nothing to do because the schedule constrains you.And since there's only one puzzle per room, your potentially 6-person team is all crowding around a single task at any given time. Part of the fun of an escape room is the way your group divides to solve different tasks and rejoins to share what they've learned, but that's impossible here since you always have exactly one puzzle in front of you.The puzzles are fairly simple but fun, the decor is amateurish but flavorful. I'm sure there are many worse rooms in the SJ area, but I know there are many rooms that are much much better."

This was my second experience ever doing an escape room. I went with my girlfriend and four other friends and we had to find our magic wands (we being wizards and all, cursed by an elf...perhaps a Hungarian elf) and find out how to escape the room in one hour. Nicely decorated with clever puzzles, you can ask for hints using a walkie talkie if you are really stuck. It is a type of experience you talk about long after it is over. Quite fun! Side note: street parking is recommended as there are just a few parking spots in the back. "

"Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-scottsdale-jurassic-escape,0,"We did The Dig and Jurassic Escape. Both werr great! Ive never done these before and was honestly blown away with how smart the puzzles were. The only complaints I have is both were for 10 people ( our party had 5) and it felt like 10 was way too many people. In both rooms it really felt like maybe 4 or 5 clear leaders took the reigns, 3 people helped and at least 2 people were completely useless and either got in the way or stood in the corner probably not enjoying themselves. The rooms really should be capped at 8. Also there should be an option to book a room as adults only or kid friendly. I can see for adults who've paid the money and are really into doing the puzzles, having to let little Timmy unlock the box or push the buttons or have a turn reading clues is just obnoxious and ruins the experience they played for. There should be like Escape the Room Junior for kids (of appropriate age) so that anyone who books that knows what they are signing up for. Likewise, being the only kid in a group where you might mot know everyone in the party is awkward for the kid and really opens up the door to awkwardness if your kid isn't totally well behaved or is competing with random adults to solve a part of the puzzle."

The personalities of others you don't know can be overwhelming and squander the experience at times.Our room guide/host would offer assistance at times, but her timing was somewhat frustrating. I understand escaping the room isn't meant to be spoon fed, although timelier guidance would've been appreciated. Overall a fun night out and we'd consider coming back again."
"Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-scottsdale-jurassic-escape,2,"We had a really fantastic time doing the Jurassic themed escape the room, the staff was friendly and funny! The room was a bit more simple design wise than I thought it would be, but it was still complex and pretty difficult! We rented the whole room for our party of 8, which while expensive that meant we could work together as a group and not have to worry about having someone we didn't know in the group.I highly suggest it though! It was a lot of fun and really made us think hard!! We were part of the 18% that beat the clock!"

"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-playground,2,"We found The Escape Game because it was right around the corner from our office, but the experience far surpassed the convenience of the location. We held a team-building event for a group of twelve in the Playground room. The game was highly engaging, fun, and just the right amount of challenging. Our group was twelve people, the maximum for the room. I would recommend a slightly smaller group, because in such a large group, people could disengage.Overall we had a great experience and recommend The Escape Game for small team-building events."

The tasks were arranged such that most of us buddied up to tackle different parts, and we all became very engaged in our separate tracks. So even though we all did the same room, each of us had an individual experience.The effects were really well done, the tasks were a good difficulty level, and each one felt like an accomplishment. Our host(/MC) was very entertaining, gave good hints, and really added to the atmosphere of the place. Not to mention, the story was compelling, creepy, and really engaging.If I could magically forget the clues, I'd be more than willing to do it over."

"Escape room ""Midnight on the Bayou"" by Red Lantern Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/red-lantern-escape-rooms-midnight-on-the-bayou,2,"I was fortunate enough to beta test this game. I was in a group of about 8 players, some of them seasoned, some were new. The waiting room is nice and comfy with a few puzzles to bide your time (and one puzzle which I still am bitter over not solving). The bathroom is well kept and spacious. The staff is really nice and clearly put this room together with a ton of love.The room itself was really cool - very different from the others I've played as the game itself had a full story from beginning to end, and everything you did within the room related directly to the story. The room is very spacious to accommodate larger parties. My friend I went with was really jumpy - she was afraid of being scared and the funniest thing about that is that nothing in it was overtly scary. I've already recommended this game to my aunt for my niece's birthday, as she's always wanted to try an escape room and I can guarantee this is a room she'd enjoy and wouldn't be frightened by.There are some really challenging puzzles and tasks in this, and some that are a little more intuitive to solve. At the end of it, our group had succeeded! Yayyy! I really loved the more detailed plot and the love that was put into this escape room."

We thought we had this one in the bag, but we were quickly reminded that we weren't as good as we thought. This room was challenging, but perfect for 6 people. We made it out with a few seconds to spare! This escape room was one of the nicer I've seen. The store location is in the middle of Hillcrest, the lobby is decorated so nicely and everything was in good quality. The staff was fun as well. We liked it so much that we stayed and played another room! Thank you, Lockdown!"
"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,3,"My husband and a few friends had time this Sunday and we tried out two of the room here. The Science room was definitely challenging. There is a lot of math involved and a LOT more 3-5 number combo locks and some red herrings. The answers to those also involve more math. Thankfully, you get white boards to help keep them straight. The puzzles felt more there to provide a challenge than fitting well in the narrative. Some of the puzzles were clever and unique though and not all are math ones. Overall we liked and had a lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,4,"This is the first room we failed (out of ~13)... We were just one puzzle away. I would recommend doing this room with 3-4 people. Before we even started, they warned us that this room is their most difficult one and they recommend 4 people and that we start off with 6 hints (as opposed to 3 and 4).The moment we stepped into the room, we were overwhelmed by the sight of a surplus of puzzles. We messed up on one of the first puzzles and were stuck on it for very long and the hints we were initially given did not help us solve the actual issue we had until way later. Near the end, we blasted through the remaining puzzles but it wasn't enough to make up for the time we wasted with the initial puzzle. They do provide white boards with working board pens but it's still difficult to remember different qualities, move to a different location, solve the puzzle, then move to a different location to actually open a lock. The room just felt like a room filled with a bunch of harder puzzles with no real story that connects the puzzles."

There were also some cool surprises to be found.  My only complaint with the experience was being paired in the room with strangers.  It makes the experience less enjoyable when you are solving puzzles with people you don't know and when their style of working is different than yours.  They had been drinking and were loud and cursing a bit, to each their own,  just not what I enjoy being around. Overall the experience was good, but it would have been so much better had it just been our group alone in there. "

I was fortunate to try their new Chocolate Factory (already did their Prohibition room), and it was one of the most creative themed rooms I have seen.Jeremy, the owner, has done something that few escape room owners can say, which is that he built his rooms using no locks and keys. Therefore, you aren't looking for padlocks or combination locks to open, only to find another locked box. The electronics he uses for opening doors, solving riddles and special effects are second to none.Anyone in North County who hasn't done an escape room before, come to Boss Play first and try their Chocolate Factory room. It will set the standard to which you will compare all other future escape rooms you go to. For those who have already done escape rooms, Boss play is worth the trip."

It is a 75-minute room because there is quite a lot to do. Unless you are a seasoned vet of escape rooms, this is a room you need a bigger group for, for sure, because there's just way too much stuff to do for two people. I went with a group of five and had an excellent time. The items you find might not be useful right when you find them but everything has a place in the story, I promise! They put a lot of thought into the storyline and the room definitely corresponds with the narrative they give. I found myself thinking, ""Granny is such a hoot!"" The end of this room is really fun."

"Escape room ""Cursed Crypt"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-cursed-crypt,0,"Cursed Crypt, my 3rd room at Escape Hotel, is a solid showing from a severely under-rated location.  Formerly the Tomb Raider room which displaced Sanatorium, your group is given the challenge of finding the final piece to an ancient artifact.  You start in a mausoleum that could have been straight out of the film itself.  The transitions between rooms was a little odd; mausoleum to a study to a boat to a temple but the production of those ""roomscapes"" was up there with the best.  Blaring sirens, wind and rain, lightning and thunder, the hum of the boats engine, the whole experience was flooded with immersive lights and sounds.  There was moderate amount of scavenging and tasking but overall, the puzzles were engaging and well tied to the theme.  The hosts in the lobby were friendly and professional but this room in particular, though, suffers from a lack of support.  For as much as these rooms cost, there really is no excuse for inattentive GMs.  Hints were generally ""keep doing what you're doing"", ""look harder"", or for something we had already finished.  And we escaped into an empty corridor with no GM to greet us.  Combined with the poor quality walkie-talkies and loud sounds I mentioned earlier made communication that much more frustrating.  But hint system and GMs aside, Cursed Crypt still comes out strong and ranks 42nd out of 129 rooms I've done so far.  Highly recommended for fans of deeply immersive rooms!"
"Escape room ""Cursed Crypt"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-cursed-crypt,1,"I've been here so many times and i love coming every single time! The first time I came, I walked in pleasantly surprised by just the lobby because of how it was decorated. It's meant to give you the creeps and they do a great job of doing that from the start. All of the employees are so funny too! You can tell they have a lot of fun with their job and they're not afraid to joke around with guests. I decided to bring some friends who were still pretty new to escape rooms and when they went to the restroom, someone went over the intercom whispering their names (and duh I loved that). Out of the rooms they have, I've done Cocaine, Circus, Escape Room Movie, Slaughtered, Cursed Crypt, and Espionage. All of them did a great job of making the group feel immersed and it was always a challenge. I'm absolutely coming back to try and finish the rest and whatever else they come out with!!"

We did the DaVinci room and it was really outstanding. I've done at least 20 escape rooms and this was one of the best-themed rooms that I've done. From the moment you walk in, they give you costumes to wear to get in the spirit of the period.Then, when you enter the escape room itself, you are immediately transported to another time and place. The escape room is really well-designed to match the theme, and the puzzles are also related to the theme.This is not a simple ""find the key"" and unlock the lock room. You actually have to use your brain for some of these puzzles. And the unique part of this room is that you're separated from half of your team to start (and you have to work with them to find a way to get together and complete the challenge.Well done!

We literally would have never figured it out if they didn't give us clues along the way! We did not escape in time but at the end they showed us what the next steps would have been and there's no way we would've finished. We had so much fun! We decided to try an easier one called abracadabra afterwards and that one we got with 30 seconds to spare. They did give us a couple of clues but it was a lot of fun, too. Just my husband and I went. If you do go for a date night, I would recommend one of the 20 minute rooms or both. If you aren't sure, call them or just ask when you get there. After we finished they'd said they recommend the shipwrecked room for several people. Overall we had a great time! They even give you a coupon for your next room after you finish."

"Escape room ""Castaway"" by Tropic Escape in Fort Myers",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-myers/quests/tropic-escape-castaway,1,"We have done a lot of escape rooms across the Southeast, and Tropic Escape Rooms is our favorite of Southwest Florida - Naples, Ft. Myers, Bonita Springs, Estero. We have made three visits to Tropic, and played their Museum, Finals and Castaway rooms. All of the rooms told an interesting story and the game masters were very helpful and welcoming. I'd recommend their rooms to both enthusiasts in the area and new players. This venue is clearly run and designed by people who also love escape games, and they built rooms they'd want to play. And most of all, they've built their rooms to be fun from start to finish. Their most recently built room Castaway really stands out in its overall story and complexity. The designs of the multiple rooms within this experience were extremely detailed. For Southwest Florida, this is perhaps the most highly immersive escape game with so many spaces, and a tight storyline. As Tropic continues to grow, we will definitely return. "

The place is a 20-30 minute drive from the Naples area but well worth the trip. We first played the ""Almost Famous"" room and later in the week played the ""Castaway"" room. Both were fantastic and very well done.Almost Famous had great scenic and state-of-the-art equipment inside the room. One of my favorite parts of this room is that you have to make a decision before you even start the game that leads to one of the most unique final puzzles I've ever seen! The tech in this room is amazing. There were a variety of really fun, immersive, hands on puzzles that lead to a ""Wow, how did they make that work?"" reaction when solved. Overall, a very, very fun room.Castaway is touted as their most difficult room and they are not kidding. The room is very challenging, but in a fun way, not in a frustrating or tedious way. There are a lot of puzzles to solve, but the solutions to the puzzles are logical, make sense, and can be solved reasonably quick once you figure out what to do. There is not a lot of ""busy work"" to do just to eat up time. The scenic is also extremely well done. The immersion factor is on point with lightning effects, flickering lights, and the sound of thunder welcoming you as soon as you walk into the room. This room offers several other ""wow"" factors as well.After we finished, we spent some time speaking to the owner and you could tell he got into the escape game business because he loved it. He told us that he only designs and builds games that he'd want to play and be proud of. He is passionate about the industry and you can see that in the product he's created. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. They are among the best in the area."

"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Basement"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-basement,0,"We escaped from the Basement. Twelve of us. It was exhilarating. We had previously done the Boiler Room. Even though we missed escaping it was still great fun (We subsequently went back and conquered it). The Boiler Room puzzles are sequential; you have to solve puzzle 1 to get to 2 ... The Basement is more of a free-for-all. We went as six couples who were friends; I think it might not be as fun to do with strangers. Not that there's anything wrong with strangers. A tip that we figured out after the fact: Designate one person to be the master of all the clues, etc. That way everything will be kept track of and there won't be a lot of redundant effort. Good luck!"
"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Basement"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-basement,1,"The Basement was my first ever escape room experience, and I can say it was one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced let alone in Los Angeles.They have made an amazing back story and theme for the entire attraction. My group tried both of the rooms they offer - the Basement and the Boiler Room. We failed both but came within seconds of solving the Boiler Room! The rooms are definitely far from an easy ride which just adds to their attraction. As of writing they are opening a third room next month which will be their longest yet - I am so excited to try it out next time I go to LA!The atmosphere, puzzles and employees make this an unmissable thing to do - you won't be disappointed no matter what kind of person you are. The whole thing is extremely innovative and for replay value they even have three different versions of the Basement which changes things up enough to essentially make it a new game. When they open the third room this means that you could easily visit at least 5 times, and I am sure they will look into adding different versions of the Boiler Room and third room in the future as long as they show continued popularity."

The Basement was probably the most atmospheric room I've been in and I'll definitely be going back to do the Boiler Room and the Study.The price is a little high at $35 for 45 minutes but as a one off experience I can accept that. The one issue I had is that I booked with a group of 4 but we were then put in with another group of 6, without being told. I understand the company want to maximize their profit but I feel the more people in the room, the less you each experience and so I would have liked to have been notified before hand."

We failed to escape the basement but we are determined to not end up in Edward Tandy's freezer again! A lot of thought and detail went into making this experience very realistic. The props, art work and noises really make you feel like your trapped in a mad man's basement. I brought my gf, who is a big horror movie fan, for her bday and she loved it! She spent the first five minutes of the experience checking out how well the room was decorated. I had to remind her that we were on a time limit and had to start looking for clues to get out. If you haven't tried it yet, I definitely recommend this place."

We did Pacific Rim, very cool!!  I personally think it helps to have seen the movie so you get the objective and some of the team requirements (like drifting).  Our group was 6 adults, 4 kids (10-13).  This was my second escape room, and I thought it was a really hard one.  There are a lot of mental puzzles, my kids had a hard time deciphering those.  They did have some physical challenges they could do, but they were out matched with this game, in my opinion.  They advised no less than 13 and I believe that is good advice.  Our MC was perfect, he helped just enough to keep it fun (versus really frustrating) but didn't give anything away, it was still a lot of hard work!  We didn't save the world, but our group still had a really great time!"
"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,1,Awesome first escape room experience! We did the Pacific Rim themed one and you definitely don't need to have seen the movie to participate. We didn't escape but we got really close. If we had about 15 more minutes we would've been okay but I'd say that's a win for the majority of our group being inexperienced with escape rooms. I don't want to spoil any of the layout or specifics but staff was super accommodating and helpful. Definitely recommend!

We chose the Pacific Rim game as it had an element of technology for our digital natives. It was lots of fun and time flew by. Our game host let us sweat just the right amount, but helped us along the way with a few clues when needed. Not only was it lots of fun and kept us on our toes the whole time, but it was really nice to see the family come together, each one taking on different roles naturally. It gave for a fun conversation afterward too on what we learned and how we can do things differently when we try another one, because we definitely will."

So there was a total of 5 of us. We ended up doing the Collector room. We were definitely advised that it was a very difficult room, which they were definitely right about that. You have to figure out a lot of combinations to open some locks. There is also some math involved, so bring someone who is good at math. I think it was a fun experience, the only thing I didn't like is if you ask for a clue then they take some time off of your clock. I've been to two other Escape rooms and I've never heard of that. They give you pretty good hints, so I don't think you'll need the clues, however we still did. lol. We were able to make it out with 4 minutes to spare!"

The first hint will cost you 1 minute, the 2nd one 3 minutes, and the third one 5 minutes.

My husband and I have done about 50 rooms and Doggy Dog World is our favorite so far. At first, we were concerned that it would be too easy (the pictures make it seem a bit kid-oriented). But, I'm glad I didn't let that stop us from checking it out. We had a blast! The puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly so and the overall concept is so unique and creative, we wish there were a ton more like it. If you're looking for a great room, try this one - you won't be disappointed!"

"Escape room ""Black Site Prison"" by Solve the Room Hawaii in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/solve-the-room-hawaii-black-site-prison,0,"Our least favoriteroom from this company. Theming was okay, cooperative puzzle design was good. There were too many red herrings that wasted our time rather than having more interesting puzzles to solve. The construction of the room was a bit flimsy. Photos placed on the wall in critical positions were pinned and fell off the wall instead of screwed in place. There were arrows drawn on duck tape that was worn off making a major puzzle difficult to solve. Both caused us to waste time. This room needs maintenance. The one electronic puzzle was frustratingly “finicky” as the game master put it. We knew the solution but had to fiddle with the puzzle components for 5 minutes before the game master came in and make it work. When the gamemaster enters the room it breaks up the immersion of the experience. This really needs to be fixed. The hint system used a radio. Players should have their hands free. The radio had multiple channels and the one correct channel was changed by mistake. The game master never told us what channel we needed so he had to enter the room to help which breaks up the immersion of the game. All of this is unavoidable. A better hint system uses the cameras and audio with hints displayed on the timer monitor. Please fix."

"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,1,"The Cranial CarnivalBrought a large group of co-workers out to Escapedom, so large that we had to split up and did all 3 of their rooms.  My group went through Cranial Carnival so this review will be about that room specifically.  The idea is that you have to enter a boy's mind and lock up bad memories that have traumatized him and put him into a coma.  Not the most believable of premises but fine.  I'll roll with it.After explaining the backstory, the GM walked us to the ""brain"" door and in we went.  I thought the entrance into the room was a little disappointing and could have been much more creative an in-line with the story (traveling down a dark passage way, a red slide), really anything more than just a doorway.   The production in the first room was decent but really felt like a square room filled with puzzles.  Other than the occasional pink squiggles on the wall, there was nothing really organic about it.  With a couple of exceptions, the puzzles seemed to mirror the memories that the boy had experienced at the circus.  A healthy dose of scavenging kicked off the room and we wasted time looking through the non-linear puzzles that are unsolvable until you finish the scavenger hunt.  One magnet/coin maze was a difficult frustrating time sync and we had some tech issues with an 8-sided polyhedron puzzle and one ""locked"" door was open.  That was room 1.  Room 2 was a mixed bag of some clever puzzles, some not so clever puzzles (light clock), and some downright frustrating tasks (fishing).  In hindsight, it was the tech issues that did us in and we came up about 2 minutes short of escaping.  Not the best, not the worst room, I've done and comes in at #112 out of 168 rooms I've done to date."
"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,2,"Just successfully escaped from Cranial Carnival, the newest of Escapedom’s rooms.

The couple that owns this place is amazing and so friendly- they've put their blood, sweat and tears into this place and it shows. There are so many little details to appreciate in the building and in the rooms. If you want a memorable experience and fun time, this is the place to come! Also, for those wondering, when we booked our party, it was just us- we we weren't paired with strangers (some places do that) which made the experience so much better! They also will give you as much or as little help as you want (other places give you a max of 3 questions). I will alway recommend this place and will be returning for sure!!!! thank you for being Awesome!!"

"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/key-quest-san-jose-detention,0,"This experience was very disappointing. This takes place in a room that must be 10 feet by 8 feet, door closed, lights out. There was no real point, no rhyme or reason to it, etc. Not at ALL like other escape rooms we have seen/experienced. We had our family of 5 there, ages 16 to 74, and we all agreed that it was a complete waste of time. Laser Quest is clearly just trying to make extra money with one of their unused small rooms, without really providing any ""experience"" at all. The employee checking us in was super nice, but the experience was terrible.Do NOT waste your money or your time !"

"Escape room ""Space Bus"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-space-bus,0,"Booked Space Bus after playing the King Arthur game and it was worth it. To start with it is a GORGEOUS game. I played a few sci-fi themed escape games around the world and this one is the best one yet. The deep rumble of engines and a little bit of movement made it so real! The game puzzles are well done and games allow for many things to be done at the same time. Also, some puzzles could be solved in more than one way. Be sure not to overcomplicate, because in many cases the solution is simpler than you think. "

The staff quickly separated the large group into 3 teams and set us on our way.  Preliminary instructions were quick, to the point, and off we were.  I was blessed with the Space Bus, a super detailed designed ""school bus"" outside of the facility.  At first I looked at he exterior and thought ""huh"", but once inside and locked it, the lights, sounds, and feeling of immersion was immediate.  And damn we're the puzzles cool and challenging.  No spoilers here, except we got maybe 4 hints, and finished the experience with 3 minutes to spare.  CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER ROOM!  Definitely will be back.  Great job!"

Our guide Will was fantastic and actually recommended some escape rooms in Los Angeles (where we went next).Actual tips:  Listen during the guide's introduction -- it'll be important.

When I played their time-traveling game""80's Flashback,"" I stepped into a bedroom with vintage teal and green carpet and realized we'd be using a boombox to play an actual cassette tape for a clue. It felt totally tubular to be sleuthing our way through the 80's. Time To Escape's other game transported me to 15th century Transylvania where I solved my way through the castle of Vlad the Impaler.

My husband and I were teamed up with mom and her adult sons, all of whom were in it to win it...and we did! I am more well-versed in escape rooms that feature puzzles to solve the room and this one relied more on finding codes and keys. The facilities were not as 'polished' as some of the other escape rooms I've been to, but still a bunch of fun! I could tell they might still be working out the kinks and hope to see this venue so well. The team running the room seemed really passionate about it and would like to visit again once they change up the theme!"

Challenging but not impossible. We made it out in 57 minutes with 2 VERY small hints. Overall, it was a great experience, everyone in our group had fun. We're all young adults in our late 20's, so it might be different case for younger kids."

I love being immersed in a different world, and the Sorcercer's Sanctum escape room made me feel like I was in a magician's manor. I have high standards, and Omnescape met them easily. The theming is top notch.I like that there were multiple rooms in this ""escape room"", too. This made solving the puzzles more satisfying and gave the room a maze-like feel versus just being stuck in one room.Sorcerer's Sanctum also has cool tech.On top of that, the room was very neat and clean.If I want to do another escape room in San Jose, I'm going to Omnescape."

I would say this was by far the best escape room I have experienced. Most escape rooms focused on the puzzle and required a good understanding of American culture, they were kind of too hard for people from non-English speaking countries. While Room 2217 gave us a totally different experience via a story, it was so real. The ending was really out of expectation. Highly recommended."

Guess that's what happens when you hang out with a bunch of over-achieving brainiacs. We had an excellent time and would highly recommend Conundrum for your escape room escapades. Everyone was super friendly and informative. Not ever doing an escape room before I wasn't sure what to expect. The helpful people at Conundrum explained everything and we were on our way to finding our way to unlocking the mystery of Deadman's Secret. Conundrum has 4 escape rooms, each with a different theme and difficultly level. The pricing is great and they can accommodate large groups with a bit of notice. Don't be surprised if you don't escape the first time.Pro tip: If you get stuck, don't wait too long to ask for a clue!"
"Escape room ""Dead Man's Secret"" by Conundrum Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/conundrum-escape-rooms-dead-mans-secret,2,"We are escape enthusiasts, and to date have played 126 rooms globally. This place is legit! We have played both CABIN IN THE WOODS and DEAD MAN'S SECRET and both productions, tech, puzzles, and flow were amazing. Their price point is fair at $25 per player and I like that they have an option to book a private room for $150. They are normally closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but I called and they were able to fit us in fortunately. Had a blast! I think having four players is the right number of players for the difficulty level but can possibly be done with just two players but will be tough to do in 60 minutes. As a comparison, we have also played at Denver Escape room and they are great, but this place is awesome. These two companies are the top in the area"

And the clue delivery system they have in place is fantastic.It's probably even more fun if you do have a wimp in your group because I think I provided the Gamemasters as much entertainment as they provided us due to my total state of panic about everything!Will be back when the second room opens!"

So do not book these too close together. We did the ocean Osiris. It was fantastic!!!! The staff helps you so you dont feel lost. We ended our night with the hospital horror. This is not an escape room, it was an “experience”. I was so submerged in my experience that I,... kind of forgot it wasn’t real. I screamed and took off my headset. My greatest fear was in that room and it felt too real to deal with it lol when I tapped out the staff was right by my side with smiles. They made me feel comfortable and supported.

"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,0,this escape room is HORRIBLE. I have no idea what game others are playing but let me tell you about it without giving the room away. For starters the clues and puzzles make zero sense. It's supposed to themed as a magicians lair but instead it is filled with gibberish as in made up words and symbols and nothing even remotely related to magic. also there is no roof to the room so it feels like you are playing in a small cubical. you can literally hear what is going on in the room right next you to clear as day also THERE IS NO AC so it was super hot in there as well. also the hints that they give you aren't relevant to what you are trying to do. I regret paying my money to go there so PLEASE BOOK ELSEWHERE
"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,1,"What a great experience! It was quite challenging for just 4 people, but we finished with just under two minutes left! An hour really flies by when your solving multiple puzzles. The puzzles were intricate and entertaining, and force you to pay attention to small details! Owner came in after we finished and she was really sweet, we stayed and talked with her for quite awhile! Glad to help support a local family who genuinely wants their guests to enjoy the game! Will DEFINITELY visit again!"
"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,2,"This place was AWESOME!

"Escape room ""The Society"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-the-society,0,"WOW. I have to say this placed has really stepped it up with their new room! If you haven't I highly recommend the Society room especially if you are new to escape rooms. As someone who has done over 50, this room is very solid.It's a nice room with several varieties of puzzles throughout.  None felt too hard or poorly designed. I played the room with 2 others and it felt very comfortable and nothing felt impossible. Everything went at a smooth pace. We were all experienced, so we all took our time and didn't feel the urge to rush. With that said we still had a out 5 minutes remaining.There were some locks here and there, but it also had its fair share of electronic puzzles as well. (Thankfully nothing glitched). I highly recommend this room if you are a beginner to escape rooms because it contains the basics that most rooms give to you throughout the country.  And if you are an expert still play it because you can't go wrong.The lobby is nice and the staff is nice as well, but overall if you have played a game here before.... YOU NEED TO COME BACK and play Society because this hands down is the best room here. That's a fact. Not an opinion."

"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-amnesia,0,"We had a great time doing both the Amnesia and Resurrection rooms. Our wonderful game master Jasmine was enthusiastic and supportive. This Quest Room location is in the South Bay Galleria, so there is ample parking, lighting, and places to eat nearby.  We have done all the other rooms by this company and these rooms have the amazing build quality, story elements, and immersion of those rooms plus an added live actor element.  The actor provides some creepy and funny moments, and helps move the gameplay and story forward.  The structure and design of the game promotes collaboration. There is hardly a moment where you feel like you are alone solving a random puzzle and then reporting back to your group. The suspense and thrill are maximized when everyone is present when there is a scary reveal or jump scare. I never heard ""What happened?"" or ""What did you see?"" We all experienced the awesomeness together.  For those apprehensive to do these rooms because of the ""horror"" element, you will be ok. These rooms have plenty of humorous and engaging moments that perfectly balance out the fear factor.  So take a deep breath and enjoy!"

Great staff and AMAZING tech. 10/10 recommend! Our actor Jasmine was great, our game master Matt was also really awesome! I'm hoping to get to see him act in the future. And Katey(Katie?) was one of the nicest bubbliest people I've ever met. Just an overall mind blowing and fun experience. (You May even get some free candy )"

When you walk up, the employees are all in character as you ""check in"" - the check in process is lengthy, so definitely get there as early as they recommend! They need you to fill out waivers and have your photo taken for a fake passport, which you get to keep (and they stamp if you successfully get out of your room). We did the Daycare room, and it was surprisingly tough, but we got out with 12 minutes remaining. We had fun and would do it again."

Once we arrived at the building, we were greeted by our host with a friendly smile and really hyped us up for what was about to come. After all of the rules and backstory, we were then led to our room. The room had a bit of a National Treasure feel and there was a lot of character to the room.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."

Mechanics, Tech, & Special Effects: the best and most elaborate currently in the Treasure Valley.  Working tech is very important to the Labyrinth team, and I'm happy to report all tech worked perfectly.Clue Distribution: one of the best I have encountered, very clever and hopefully maintainable.  We didn't need to really use it, but it really fit the WWII theme well.Searching: kept minimal, which is ideal, especially for veterans (thank you).Puzzles: very logical and required little [if any] guessing.  Excellent progression feedback. They were the perfect level of difficulty for beginner/intermediate players, but possibly too simple for veteran players and enthusiasts.  That is a tough balance to strike for an ER, and I understand why they erred towards the easier side for this room.  I'd love to see some development to allow for a quick-to-implement option to increase the difficulty here (my team of 4 got out in under 28 minutes with no clues). Lighting: Dim, but not low enough to need a flashlight.Bottom line is that this group took their vast experience, discovered what they liked and didn't like, and used that knowledge to build a terrific room that offers an excellent experience.  I'd recommend this room as #1 for enthusiasts visiting the area, and would just caution local 1st timers to not expect the exact same level of excellence at most of the other local options.  We also did the 60 minute version of another one of their rooms called Revolution (they typically run this with a 30 min version of the room).  Set design was excellent, use of tech/mechanics were great, clue distribution was unique and fun and fit the period perfectly, puzzles were mostly fun and unique, but their final puzzle I feel could use some more thought as that could definitely be improved upon and still keep the period authenticity they are hoping for.If you're going to do a few rooms in the area, absolutely do Operation Longbow, but save it for last.I'll for sure be back to try their Excalibur room that they expect to open in a couple months."

"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,0,My friends and I did the Red Giant room. It is one of the best rooms we have done. The puzzles were intricate and each room had unique tech that made it a lot of fun.
"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,1,"Took my 8 year old niece here and we had SO much fun. We did the easiest room (the red giant)and it was just the right amount of challenging for the adults and some simple things that she was able to do. Honestly, she probably figured out more than the adults (she's a smarty like that). It was great for her because it was so interactive and hands on. We've been to many rooms that are just a bunch of locks and keys and that's not what this one was. Props and statues put in the right place would activate a movement. It was well done!! The man at the beginning was great at getting my niece excited. He explained so sweetly about the game and made it sound so fun that she was confident and ready to conquer. That intro made it!"
"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,2,"This review is for Red Giant only.""Red Giant"" refers to a ruby in a crypt, not the planet, so leave your space helmets at home.Parking here is super convenient in the back of the building, but the driveway leading to the parking lot is FILLED with potholes, and when we went there, a giant pond was formed b/c of the rain. There is a ring doorbell and the words ""QUEST ROOM"" in red next to the door. It looks super sketch back there.But once you ring the bell and enter, it is NICE inside. It's obvious that they put a lot of effort in building and maintaining the place. The room itself is VERY well thought out, from where they orient you, to the hints, to the final puzzle. We only needed two hints. The first hint we needed because we weren't patient enough, and the second hint we needed because we weren't as observant when we first entered the tomb as we should have been. There were a couple of times when we received unsolicited hints because we weren't on the right track, which was really nice of them.All in all, I LOVED how this room was designed. Everything really fit well. If I were to change anything, it would be to minimize the Many pages of text in this one book. It's fun, but the book was filled with red herrings, which you don't realize are red herrings until you get to the end and the book explicitly explains which pages are important. I highly recommend this room!"

"Escape room ""Hunting Lodge: Wolf Moon Night"" by Xcapade in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/xcapade-the-hunting-lodge,0,"Was very disappointed with this escape room. Despite the wonderful hosts, polite and friendly attitude, the story telling before the room felt rushed and mostly pointless. The room was poorly constructed, offering no immersion into the scenario, the props were lack luster, with many of them being broken or poorly functioning. The puzzles were a madening combination of way to easy, and way to convaluted. The puzzles were often solved out of order, leading to confusion when pointless clues were discovered later. While challenge is to be expected, many aspects were more dumb than challenging, such as a 5 letter combo lock utilizing only 4 letters in the solution, broken props that seem like puzzles, and visual problems that are very counter intuitive. My biggest regret is that I introduced 2 friends to escape rooms here and I can only hope that the poor taste left in their mout from this doesn't stop them from trying others with me in the future."
"Escape room ""Hunting Lodge: Wolf Moon Night"" by Xcapade in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/xcapade-the-hunting-lodge,1,The quality of the room and the props were poorly constructed.

On Sunday, John made They're Coming a great experience. He gave us tips when we needed but held back when we thought we could figure it out. And when he wasn't sure, he asked! Great concept. (At times I feel like game masters give unwanted help - over-enthusiasm, which I understand, but can be a bit frustrating/annoying.) John was very friendly, positive and genuinely excited for us.

They even made the sounds in the room match the theme. It was scary and exciting. the clues forced us to work together as a team. everyone in my group had something to do, so no one got left out.

"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-spellbound,2,"We did the Spellbound room and liked a lot of things about it.  The decor/ambiance is really good and the puzzles are both fun and challenging.  It is different than other escape rooms that I've done in the past in that there are several objectives you are trying to complete, it's not the typical solving one puzzle leads to the next, leads to the next until you're free.  Because of the way it is structured, doing it with strangers is fine because they can be working on one puzzle while you work on another and if they find a clue for you or you find one of theirs you can share information, but multiple objectives can be getting done at the same time.  It was easy to get tickets and book through their online system and the guy who co-owns it was really nice and helpful. The building they chose for the location is great because it is on a rooftop and there is EASY parking in the back."

But even though we didn't have any experience, it was so fun. The puzzles were very challenging and fun at the same time.

We had so much fun figuring out how to escape from Captivated At Sea. Much better than a couple of hours at a movie or other type of entertainment. We actually needed to work together to solve the clues we were finding and each solved clue led to another clue. The clues were all unique and intriguing. The solutions were a lot of fun.The creators of Clues and Gumshoes are clearly very creative. They put together an interesting room with an interesting story to go with it. Lots of fun things to interact with in the room.This experience has definately got us hooked on Escape Rooms. We want to go back and try the other three rooms at Clues and Gumshoes.

The theming was on POINT, there was just enough to do, and there were a few surprises along the way. And our game guide, James, was so much fun. He knew when to drop a hint and when to let us struggle for a bit. Overall, it was a fantastic experience that I highly recommend!"

We are so happy we went! The three games were all great. The Lab is a great intro room - tweens/teens would like it as would rookie escapers. We did AI and it was also fun. Villain’s Lair ended up being our favorite despite us not getting out (20 more seconds, so close!!). Sabrina was great as our game master and is definitely an asset to the company. Definitely check this place out if you like good and intuitive rooms with great scenery."

I thought this one was awesome! We did the villains lair (escaping a North Korean jail) that has a 23% pass rate. Our host was super nice in getting us set up and explaining things. Id recommend for sure and would be back!"
"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-villains-lair,2,"Did both the newest Villain's Lair and the AI escape rooms here. I thought the AI room was more of a room that was rated 4, and the Villain's Lair a 4.5.Both rooms were extremely different, but very engaging. My group of six with varied levels of experience had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles which required some thinking out of the box for both rooms and a lot of running around.I'd recommend at least a group of four for Villain's Lair and no less than four. I think we benefited from having six people because for both AI and Villain's Lair there were a couple puzzles that definitely helped having more people, not less, which is the opposite of what I find for most escape rooms. (I find 4 to be the perfect number). Having spent a lot of time surveying other escapers to find out what rooms would work for a larger group, we settled on Exit Game, and I'm glad we did! Escaping in time definitely relied on teamwork!For Villain's Lair there was a greater level of detail put into the room than in AI, and a lot less button pushing. However, there is one puzzle in Villain's Lair that requires a lot more abstract thinking and may or may not take your group longer to figure out. When we went, the ""alarm"" was speeding up which made a couple of us think we had lost and didn't escape when we still had 7 minutes left when we escaped! Since it was new to the San Diego space, we figured it was expected that they would still have issues and gave them feedback.For AI the details of the rooms were a lot less immersive than Villain's Lair, and I felt most of the puzzles required button pushing. I liked the use of technology and the use of a computer. A few of the puzzles really forced ourselves to think outside of the box. Once you have ""escaped"" you can choose to do hard mode, which our group chose to do.Villain's Lair we were told was a mix of traditional locks and technology (a mix of AI and The Lab basically), of which our group enjoyed more personally. AI is more technology and have no real locks that I can think of, and The Lab which we haven't done is more a traditional lock type room.I really liked our game master, who gave us appropriate clues without revealing too much, just the way we like it, via walkie talkies for both rooms.I'd definitely add Exit Games as one of the top Escape Room companies in San Diego. My group will be back to do their last room, The Lab."

When we explained and even spoke with the employee he said was not allowing it. Customer service must not be a priority. They must not understand that without customers their doors would not be open. I can only hope that the owners of CQ Tactical conduct an internal review so other customer are not out $100.00, because they reneged on their agreement.

You didn't get too stumped where it killed momentum but it wasn't too easy that you ran through the room, it was a clever mix of good puzzles. WIth asylum, I loved the immersion. There is something they do thst is very unique,  quite freaky but VERY cool... you will just have to play it to find out but the immersion was great and puzzles were a bit more challenging than framed was.

So if you're used to letter locks and combo locks, you'll be challenged in this room. I would definitely recommend this room! The staff were very laid back and fun. Also, I spoke with a female staff member over the phone regarding a question I had, and she was very helpful in helping me find an answer.

He said that they help manage people's time with clues when he knows they won't escape on time. I loved that he let us have more time to solve it without help. The puzzles ranged in difficulty level widely which I think is great because I don't want anyone to get bored but I also don't want anyone to feel stupid, ha! It was hands on, it was solvable working in one group, multiple small groups or individuals with each puzzle so it's a great time without worrying about personality conflicts.

I thought the room was very creative and a lot of the puzzles/challenges were well thought out. We had a group of 7 and that seemed like the perfect size for this escape particular escape room. We managed to finish but barely did it on time! The girl who helped us there was extremely nice as well and she made sure that all of us had a good time! Definitely going back to try the other room out next!

This was probably the best escape room I’ve done. The people who designed it created fun, challenging, and unique puzzles. I thought the design was well laid out and you had to work together with your other teammates to figure out the solutions. All of the employees were so friendly and kind. We spoke to Brandon on the phone and he warmly explained everything to us in detail. Then we had a friendly woman who set us up acted as our jester. She made the experience even more fun. I was very impressed and I’m so looking forward to trying their other room!"
"Escape room ""Night Train 1892 - Jewel Heist"" by Grande Royal Escape in Jacksonville",https://worldofescapes.com/jacksonville/quests/grande-royal-escape-jewel-heist,0,"We did the Train Heist room and it was really fun, but the doors and locks didn't work that great. The concept is awesome as I've completed over 40 rooms across the country, but the lack of making sure the codes were correct was bad. We had to work on ""other stuff"" while a staff member had to fix a code on one item which is highly discouraging and distracting. I still believe the room was unique and fun though. If you're in town, it's definitely worth trying this room."

It was almost like walking onto the set of Legends of the Hidden Temple. It really sold the atmosphere of being inside a temple, and aside from a bit of a very minor frustration with one specific searching puzzle I had no real issues of note. I will definitely be back for their Bill and Ted and Terminator rooms and will be recommending them to all my friends who like escape rooms. If you are looking for a really well done room I recommend Escape Westgate, you'll have a fantastic time. Plus one the owners look like Michael Douglas so that a bonus!"

We had a great time though and felt very proud of ourselves for getting as far as we did. Our host was very generous with the hints, since we kept running around the room asking questions. Very fun, will do again but with a bigger group. Thanks!"

"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,0,"A Narrow Escape is a family-owned small business that offers three different hour-long escape room game experiences at a local N Semoran Blvd location. I took five teenagers in February 2018 for the Doctor Lycan room and they enjoyed it a great deal. They are pretty smart 13 and 14 year olds and they went until the very last second before escaping. Challenging but fun they said with a few creepy moments that appropriately played into the ""werewolf"" theme of the room. The owner and her family are absolutely amazing and enthusiastic about seeing their customers have a great time. We will definitely return. Check it out and support this small business while enjoying some brain-busting entertainment!"

"Escape room ""Doctor Lycan"" by A Narrow Escape in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/a-narrow-escape-doctor-lycan,2,"This new escape room is family owned and operated-they built it all themselves and did an amazing job. The employees are very nice and helpful. You will get more of a personal experience here than at the franchises and the high turnover style ones off of I Drive, where you are thrown together with people you don't know and rushed out the door to make way for the next group of way too many people crammed into a room together. This place is definitely worth the drive for both tourists and locals.All three rooms are great. My favorites were The Woods and Dr. Lycan. What I love about this place is the option for just a few dollars more to have a totally private experience without being paired with strangers. I feel like every escape room should do this, and they're the only ones in town that I know of that do."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,0,Did the prison break. Very nicely set up. Mechanics are incredibly creative. Coming back next week to try the others.
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,1,"Our group of 8 did the Prison Break escape room and succeeded in escaping in their hardest room. Some of us consider ourselves useless in escape rooms but we had a good time. While there were a lot of puzzles and hidden objects to solve, the game is as hard as you want to make it because a lot of clues are given even if you don't ask for them. If you want to make the game harder, probably tell the game keeper that you do not want clues given unless you ask. Overall would recommend if you are wanting to be challenged but not so much so that you feel like you have no chance of escaping. Paris was our game keeper and she was definitely keeping an eye out for us and letting us know what illegal things we were doing (like climbing...) and giving us relevant clues. Wish there was more of a celebration after the game like having signs to hold up for pictures."

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,3,It was most amazing experience!! We did the Prison Break escape room as a family. We were joined by another family. Right from the get go the immersive experience began with a very well done setup. Teamwork and communication is very important and we were lucky to have a great dynamic going.The puzzles were fairly challenging but the thrill of cracking the clues was exhilarating. The solutions didn't cease to surprise.The team at the Escape Games is phenomenal! Very personable and super nice. Would especially like to mention Emily and Jackie who helped out tonight.Highly recommend this place to families - my daughter (7.5 years old) is hooked!
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,4,This place is so nice and inviting that my friends and I will keep going till we finish all the rooms.  We just finished the prison break room and it was so amazing and immersive.  What was so great was that Jeff and gurion were so accommodating to one of our teammates being late.  It was great having the full time and for them to allow us to wait and do the room together.  We are definitely coming back to do every room and finish them all.  Best kind of service and such intuitive rooms.

"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,4,"Well, how can I not give it 5 stars when we beat the room time record! This was not my first escape room, and I'd say it's right up there with my favorites. Good series of challenges that are thought-inducing and challenging, but not too impossibly hard that you just get frustrated. It's well organized and professionally run. The art gallery theme plays nicely into the challenges too. Definitely recommend."
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,5,"I've done a few of these escape/puzzle rooms, and Escapism is by far the best one.  It is challenging and fun.  You do have the option to ask for clues, which we tried not to do.  This is a great activity for a group of close friends.  I DO NOT recommend this activity for couples who are just dating. This game can get rough and a bit physical since a lot of the clue will require you to get on your knees (not a clue).  A group of 8 might be too much energy and too confusing.  A group of 4-6 is good."

Our group of 8 decided to try out this escape room and were greatly pleased.  We did the Art Museum escape room, and there was a great number of puzzles for our group to solve.  There were a number of very innovative and unique puzzles, and it also had a good number of creepy, twists and turns (although nothing scary)!  I would love to explain more, but I don't want to give anything away.We had to use one hint, but we made it out with 15 minutes to spare.  Definitely looking forward to trying their next room."

Didn't make it out in time as we had 2 puzzles left, but it only makes us wanna come back and try another room. The teammate Rebecca was awesome!

I've also been to many escape rooms but I think some of the escape rooms here have been my favorite. You definitely have to work fast and open minded. The only room we did not pass was a very new one, paranormal, which was too difficult. I would recommend them to have a beta testing period and have the prices of the room be even cheaper so they can figure out what works best for the room. Overall, my friend and I always have a blast here and feel accomplished after beating the rooms...which cannot be said for most other places! We are team #blackhat, remember it!"

Alan gave us a helpful intro tutorial and answered all of the (many) questions we had. The facility was clean and the room & the props in it were realistic.

Our little group of four smarty-pants.... rather, three smarty-pants and one very short but enthusiastic cheerleader (that would be me by the way), had a blast in The Elevator scenario which was perfect for a group of four!  The puzzles were challenging and fun.  The environment was themed so well!  They even had elevator music playing as we worked our way around each dilemma.  We escaped in time, and made the leader board for about 5 minutes as I'm sure other teams have beaten that record by now.  Still, we were proud of it and it was such a fantastic experience for our friends visiting from Oregon!The service was wonderful and the young lady who helped us (she told us her name a few times but I have the memory of a goldfish) was utterly helpful and delightful to talk to.  A young man also game out to greet us, who very much seemed like he was very knowledgeable about the rooms.  Anyway, I digress.  Exodus is fantastic.

"Escape room ""Terminal"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-terminal,0,"Unfortunately I can't give this escape room a good review. I've participated in 40+ escape rooms in the Phoenix area and this room was by far my worst experience out of all of them. On the plus side, the room was very well decorated and the experience was immersive, however the train car motion actually caused some pretty moderate nausea with no way to turn it off until the first puzzle was solved. The remaining portion of the room had a set of adequate puzzles, but then 2 longer puzzles that were simply annoyingly tedious, it never felt like we achieved anything when solving the puzzles.We didn't escape the room, however in similar situations in other rooms we have enjoyed laughing about where we made mistakes and how we could do better and appreciating the design of the puzzles - this room only left us frustrated and annoyed.These complaints are probably causes or magnified by the fact that, from our perspective, our GM was either ignoring our group, and the clues we did receive seemed to be lacking or were significantly delayed from when we did ask for help.Considering the premium cost of these rooms, we will unfortunately not be returning to finish their other rooms unlike the dozen or other companies that we have ""cleared out"". I really had such high expectations and never have been so disappointed with an escape room."

However, I didn't help plan or test The Entrapment. I was actually proud to be one of its first official customers. I've done a few escape rooms and always felt that the puzzles were disconnected and lacking in innovation or just so random that they weren't enjoyable...none of that applies to The Entrapment! This escape room consisted of a variety of incredibly clever puzzles (of just the right difficulty) woven together in a story that made the experience unique and challenging. I loved that that there was a theme and story for the whole experience. Each object in the room was relevant and purposeful and added ambience. This is unlike the other escape rooms I've done that seemed to be full of completely unrelated puzzles or random office supplies that were intended to be puzzles. The story helped make the puzzles solvable and kept you connected to what was going on. I LOVED all of it and I can't wait until Scott creates another room to escape from!! In the mean time, get your friends together and book a time now!!!"

The hosts were great and made us feel very welcome. We had a lunch catered in before the event, as well as drinks/desserts afterward. The rooms themselves were very challenging, and only 1 of our 4 groups was able to escape within the allotted hour. Each room has a host ""monitor"" watching your progress from another room, and offering hints when asked (subject to limits) or when the wheels are spinning. Very interesting to see how we all interact and operate outside of our ""normal"" work environment. We would highly recommend Breakout Games and plan to make this an annual event. "
"Escape room ""Operation: Casino"" by Breakout Games - Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/breakout-atlanta-operation-casino,4,"Loved the event, though a teammate who has played roulette said the math for the casino room was strange. I'd say the room was a somewhat too challenging for the time allotted and they should let folks keep going beyond the timer if no one else is waiting in line after you (maybe that was an option, but I'm not aware of it).Enjoyed the overall experience though! It was great fun. "

The staff was super nice and excited to have us there. The rooms had such fun themes, and great attention to detail and I wanted to try them all. We did the Beach room and solved it with 53 seconds left to spare. It was a little rush every time we solved a clue, and super exciting when we got the final clue solved as the clock was ticking down. Win or lose, it's a fun way to spend an afternoon or evening and I highly recommend."

So unique compared to any other rooms I have done. I’ve been to rooms all over the country and world. Most games will focus on a multitude of locks/keys or numbers. “Bloody Elbow” only requires 1 key and no numbers. This made the game feel way more immersive and intuitive. It felt as if I was escaping like I would in real life. Physical activity required was such a good element! Highly recommend if your in the LA area.
"Escape room ""Bloody Elbow"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-bloody-elbow,3,"I have done many escape rooms, and this one was by far the best.

The puzzles were all perfectly on theme and none of them felt ""tacked on"" at all. The set pieces were highly interactive, beautifully done, and larger than most rooms. Everything fit and gave a real sense of progression. I can't give enough praise to this experience. If you are thinking about trying it out, just do it. I give my word that you will have an absolute blast. Looking forward to their new experiences. I plan on trying them all."

This was my first time doing an escape room and it was definitely harder than I anticipated! Luckily, we had some tips from a fellow ""prisoner"" to help us through. You won't play with any strangers so make sure you bring a group of 3 to 5 people. I want to go back and try the DaVinci room now!"

Like all of their rooms, it's beautiful. It features a variety of different types and levels of puzzles. It's the perfect room for experienced enthusiasts as well as newcomers because there is a lot to do in this room. It's absolutely beautiful!I really like their rooms and for someone who tends to not like public bookings, this company's public booking policy doesn't bother me. For this room, I usually end up playing with a lot of newcomers and they tend to be quite easy going and terrific at working together. It's fun meeting new people and seeing what they come up with and finding solutions together. Because I've played their rooms before, it's easy to navigate and know when the in room game master is providing subtle hints, which are very useful. Watch your in room game master. If she/he is looking at something, it's probably best if a couple of people in your group see what they are looking at because there is an order to solving the puzzles in the different rooms.In terms of parking, I've usually found metered parking or I've walked to the venue or even have taken the subway and walked a little bit. The area is not fancy, but what area is in downtown Los Angeles.I like Escape Room LA's rooms a lot. I think their set designs are phenomenal and a bar above what many others are doing."

I'm not too much into gaming but it was well worth the experience. We also did the one with the doctor. Now that one was pretty interesting. Since all of our group is involved in the medical field one way or another, it was pretty fun to try and keep the Patient alive. Took a lot of team work and felt like we were in the E.R. trying to keep the dummy alive!!! LOL!The arcade area was fun. Plenty of games to play. From famous arcades to tic tac toe Basketball to skiball.

If not impressed by the room, you'll love the staff. It's owned by a lovely couple, who are very welcoming and fun to talk to.

While it was a little tough, we had a smart little 12-year old in the room with us to help with the clues! Escaped with 1:43 left and couldn't stop talking about how much fun we had! I love that it's a local, family-run business. We will be back!"

"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Horror Escapes LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/horror-escapes-la-zombie-lab,0,"Don't be fooled by all the 5 star reviews!!!Just finished the Zombie Lab tonight and let me begin by saying, the pervious reviews hyped the room so much, but when we got there it was a big dissapointment. I am an escape room enthusiast and this was my 19th room. I would rank it 18th out of 19 rooms.  (Spoiler Free Review)Parking/Lobby:First off parking is hard to find but I suggest trying to find it on the street or at the lot at 11th and Olive. If you pass by that it will take to about 10 minutes to circle back around due to the one way streets and traffic. When we got there the host was by the door which was very nice because we were slightly unsure where to go. We entered and were told that there were going to be 6 other people in the room with us (randoms). The lobby was nice; theres a bathroom, lockers, and a bunch of comic books that are for sale. After waiting a few minutes we were shown the safety video, told the backstory of the room and then walked  to the room. The Room:Our first impression for the room was that it was fairly bland and lacking in decor. We got through the room fairly quick but we escape with 8 min to spare because we got hung up on a puzzle and because one of our locks was being finicky (The Game Master(GM) had to come in and help us with it since we had the correct combination in it and it still wasn't working). This room is a Gen 1 room, meaning the there is no technology puzzles in the room, just combos, locks and keys. The Zombie aspect of the room was one of the most hyped in the reviews but when we experienced it was sub par. The whole ""encounter"" is probably about 3-5 minutes since the zombie ends up leaving through the door (which didn't make sense in the plot line). I had thought that the zombie would be super scary and be with us until the end of the game but I was wrong. The actor playing the zombie did a good job for the time that they were in the room, I just wish they would have stayed in the room instead of leaving. The Hint System: You get 3 hints in this room, if you so close to take them. The are offered at the 30min mark, 15 min mark and 10 minutes mark (if i'm remembering correctly). During these time checks the GM would open the door and say ""The doctor will see you in ___ minutes."" I did not like that form of hints/ time checks at all, it really takes you out of the zone and pulls you out of the game mode. I think it would be so much better if they either had a screen with the clues and timer on it or a simple walkie talkie system. The Staff: Our GM was very friendly and courteous. She helped us get settled in and described the rooms to us very well. I did not like however that when you call the companies number with a question to ask, that no one picks up and it goes straight to a recorded message. Overall:I give this room 3 out of 5 stars because I felt like they could do so much more. The decor in the room was lacking and I honestly feel as though most of the room was wasted space. There were such few actual puzzles to solve in the room and the atmosphere in the room could have been better. The actor should stay in there room for longer, even stay the until the group escapes as that would add a element of rush and fear to the game. The hint system needs to be improved. Honestly, a $30 pack of walkie talkies would be sufficient enough because without it, every time you need a hint you're taken away from the game and brought back into ""reality"". I would only recommend this place to people who have never done an escape room before. After doing so many I just wasn't very impressed with this one. I'm hoping that their other rooms will be better. For the price though (we used Groupon) I would like to try to come back and escape there hardest room (The Office)."

"Escape room ""The Lab 51"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-mission2-the-lab,0,The only issue I have with Exit Game is that they pair you up with strangers. I went with a group of 3 and they paired us up with a group of 4. The whole time I felt like they didn't really contribute to anything as they had no clue what was going on. All I can say is that you really have to think outside the box in order to escape this room.

"Escape room ""The Lab 51"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-mission2-the-lab,6,"Went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday and did the Lab. It was a lot of fun! The story was that we were marines on a mission to escape an alien lab. You have 60 minutes to go through a series of complex puzzles, locks, clues, many rooms, and it was a great exercise in teamwork! It cost about $30/head and we had 10 people, which was a pretty good size for the challenge. The lab has a physical element to it where you need to crawl and duck your head low. They have alternatives if you cannot crawl or have claustrophobia, but it does take away from the overall experience, so opt for another challenge if that's a limitation of yours.  Especially compared to the Escape Game in Anaheim, this place was much more complex and believable with all the props and game design. It's not cheap, but a fun thing to do with a group of friends if you are looking for something different. It's located on the basement level of the Atlantic Shopping plaza where Empress Harbor Seafood and Half & Half are. Parking is free and head down the escalators to find it."

Escape Dothan is by far the best one we have been to so far. The people that work the rooms allow you to struggle some before they give you hints. They don't make it too easy to get out!

"Escape room ""Spy Game"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-spy-game,0,"I did Escape Oakland's newest room, The Spy Game, today and it was very challenging but also quite fun. It's their toughest room, with an 8-10% escape rate. (There seems to have been some misinformation on here stemming from another reviewer's description of the room difficulties based on their subjective opinion, but the website posts the % escape rates for each room.)I'd recommend The Spy Game for groups of experienced escape roomers. If your team has first-timers, you might want to consider one of their easier rooms instead. I think first-timers might feel a little frustrated by this one. It's not the flashiest room, but there are a ton of puzzles to chew on and lot of variety in types of puzzles. I think this is a great room to try if you're someone who is really in it for the puzzles and a good challenge. I'm not as into rooms that have Hollywood-movie-set-esque decorations but easy puzzles, so I'm glad I chose this one.I was on the fence about giving them a 4 or a 5, but settled on 5 because they were patient with my team after we didn't escape the room in time. In addition to giving us like 10 minutes extra, they were nice about one of the guys who kept trying to continue to solve stuff when they were explaining the clues to us, etc.My general feeling is that even though they are relatively new and don't have the super fancy bells and whistles of some of the larger and more established escape room companies, they seem dedicated to trying to make solid puzzles/rooms. I think they'll continue to improve their rooms and the experience overall."

They are located at the Wyndam Hotel on Lewers street. It is easy to locate them, just look for the Hotel sign and Breakout is on the left! There should be signs. Our group tried The Hero as a beta room on March 10th and we also chose the ""public room"" which included random people. (2) The prices were half off since it was a beta room and the public room option also made it cheaper. It turned out to be less than $15 a person! If you would like a private room option it is a bit more expensive, and hey! Two heads are better than one!The two people we met up with were super friendly and pleasant to work with. It was nice experiencing a different dynamic beyond our group of friends. The biggest part of escape rooms is communication! Since we were beta testers, there were some complications and it set us back, but our room supervisor? the worker? added on 5 more minutes for us. We escaped! The biggest challenge was actually parking LOL, we weren't sure where to park for the new location. Just follow the directions on Breakout's FAQ about parking. It is at the Embassy Suite and the only option is valet. It $6 with validation, and after parking just go to the right side down the hall and cross the street and go a bit more down and breakout will be towards your right! It's a 2 minute walk. The workers are always welcoming and very nice. They know that the experience can be a bit scary to people (esp. for scaredy cats like me) and always make me feel comfortable. I've done a total of 4 rooms!"
"Escape room ""The Hero"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-the-hero,1,"I had bought 2 spaces for a friend and I to do the hero. I liked it but i didn't find it to be as challenging as other escape rooms I've done. The staff was very nice and the space was nice. I think they were still doing construction though because the space didn't look completed. We had been put with another group which I didn't mind however it was a bit awkward because when checking in they didn't tell us we were going to be with another group. Because of this, the room was kind of awkward to do especially because we hadn't acquainted ourselves with the other group in the lobby since we didn't know we'd be working with them. I think that this place is good for large groups but I probably wouldn't recommend it for a small group since there's a possibility of being with another random group. I enjoyed it, but with the reviews I expected the room to be more challenging."
"Escape room ""The Hero"" by Breakout Waikiki in Honolulu",https://worldofescapes.com/honolulu/quests/breakout-waikiki-the-hero,2,"When in Waikiki.... this is a MUST! I completed (and barely escaped: The Hero) a room with my husband during our honeymoon and it was definitely AMAZING, one of the highlights of our trip. Our top and most favorite room of all of the 10+ we have completed all over California. They have a high level of technology and the friendliest staff! Do it! You will not regret it!"

Still as fun as ever. This room has less of a storyline, but plenty of challenging puzzles. Instead of trying time to escape, you and your teammates have to get as much treasure as quickly as possible. This adds a different feel to the adventure and my friends and I had a fantastic time with our individual puzzles, as well as the puzzles we worked on together. Missed out on first place, but we smashed second place! Highly recommend Escape Chronicles to anyone looking for a good night of puzzle solving."

"Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-noras-nightmare,2,"Played Nora's Nightmare yesterday and, it turned out, we were the first group to play the room since it officially opened.  As enthusiasts (almost 200 rooms played), we're always hesitant to try a brand new game as we've quickly learned it's much better to give them some time (even after beta testing) to fine tune things and make sure it runs they way they intended. But since we were jonesing for a room, we decided to go for it. From the first point of contact, via FB messenger, their customer service was spot on. The owner (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name) was friendly, very accommodating and responded to my inquiries quickly. As for the room, we enjoyed it quite a bit! I loved the unique theme and really liked the thought and details that were put into the aesthetics of the room. The puzzles are a good mix of lock & key as well as some tech so it should easily appeal to a variety of players. They are not overly difficult but they do still provide a good challenge and make you slow down to think. We are a two-person team and we finished with time to spare.  Afterwards, we spent quite a bit of time talking shop with the owner. She was very personable and didn't make us feel rushed or like she had something better to do. I know I already said it, but the customer service was on point with Puzzling Escape. As much as we love playing rooms, we also love talking with the owners and staff about the experience as well as about escape rooms in general.  We really enjoy hearing about what went into the design and development of their rooms and just learning about how it all started for them. We can't wait for their other rooms to open. Nora's Nightmare is a fun time for anyone looking for something neat to do. Regardless of your level of experience, get out there and play this game.  You'll be glad you did."

We did not get our time back And made us question every lock we came across (which were ALOT). The second room we encountered also had a wonky tool that wouldn’t work properly and that also took us around 10-15 minutes to move on. This was to the point we were asked if we needed someone to come in. It is unfortunate because the concepts were cool and interesting and the workers were enthusiastic and friendly.

The room is their latest room and they use modern tech for their cursed room. If you are thinking booking a room at Immersion, might I suggest the Cursed room over their other out-dated rooms. But in case you haven't guessed it from the room's name,  Cursed, expect it to be scary.The room is pretty packed but not overly expansive. A group of 4 seems ideal. Couples will likely experience a difficult time at Cursed while large groups will bump into each a lot in the cramped spaces.I did think the theme and story of the room was by far, the most bizarre plot I've experienced.

"Escape room ""Plight of the Margo"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-plight-of-the-margo,0,We had sooooo much fun! I’ve done escape rooms all over the world and this was at least 100x cooler and more complex than anything I’ve ever played before.It took them 3.5 years to build it. It was worth every penny and really well planned out. No boring locks and keys like most escape rooms.I booked the room for my son’s 15th bday party. All of his friends couldn’t stop talking about it. The game masters were amazing! I can’t wait to do part 2!
"Escape room ""Plight of the Margo"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-plight-of-the-margo,1,"Plight of the Margo was our favorite escape room ever, even beating the Mission to Mars we did in Pigeon Forge, TN. First, the design was awesome; the thematic content, high-tech set, and multitude of puzzles that could simultaneously engage an entire ""crew"" of a rescue spaceship was superb. There is one place in the set that is not designed for easy walking access (you have to crawl through a hatch/tunnel), but the set is spacious. We had 11 team mates (4-10 is recommended), several of whom were engineers --and who never got bored, by the way; there was good diversity of puzzle types (high-tech, across-the-room collaboration, creative thinking, etc.). We were only able to do the first of two 90-minute (scored) sessions due to our brief stay in the Denver area, but 90 minutes is a good duration for one session in this room. Your team has to manage concurrent puzzle content, because it is extremely easy to lose track of who's doing what, what clues have already been used, etc. Communication is key. Our team of 3 didn't know the other team of 8, but we rapidly melded into a good crew. It was a fully enjoyable and memorable experience. Hats-off to the designer of this room. (You did a marvelous job, even if we did ""cheat"" a little with one of your safety devices. ;-) Darned engineers."
"Escape room ""Plight of the Margo"" by ConTRAPtions Escape Rooms in Fort Collins",https://worldofescapes.com/fort-collins/quests/contraptions-escape-rooms-plight-of-the-margo,2,I played the space room (Find the Margo) over Christmas break and had a great time!

"Escape room ""PROstate Farm"" by Solve Who, LLC in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/solve-who-prostate-farm,0,"Absolutely fantastic! This is similar to an escape room game, but instead, you solve a murder. There are clues you have to find like blood, fingerprints, and a murder weapon. There are small details all over the place and it was actually funny as hell. The owners worked with actual detectives, forensic scientists, and the people who do autopsies! After you make your judgement and give your “verdict”, they go over how the murder transpired. It is split into 3 portions. First you investigate the crime scene, then you go over 3 interrogations with the 3 suspects, then you get all the evidence you found - back from the “lab” and an autopsy report. A really cool aspect, was that you report the evidence you find, so if you miss a clue, it won’t be turned back into you when you piece the mystery together with your group. I highly recommend this place!"
"Escape room ""PROstate Farm"" by Solve Who, LLC in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/solve-who-prostate-farm,1,"Came here as a double date with a group of 4 of us. We had a blast! I was expecting another escape room which start to have the same repetitive puzzles to solve and was pleasantly surprised that this was different. You're solving a crime rather than trying to escape. We did the PROstate insurance room and there were three parts. First you spend about 20 minutes at the area of the crime scene and then you go to the interrogation room and then you debrief where you try to put together all the evidence to figure out who the murderer was. I really commend them on the way they have this laid out and everything was in great condition. They even gave us a camera to use to take pictures of the crime scene. There was a ton of humor throughout this and we got a lot of good laughs. This was an awesome time and I can't wait to go back and solve the other crime! We ended up solving the crime, but it was difficult and we missed a lot of clues along the way. If you're looking for a fun night out I highly recommend!"

"Escape room ""Space Station Tiberia VR"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-space-station-tiberia,1,"I went back and tried the VR room, the space room. Absolutely incredible. I have done VR before, oculus and Samsung vr, but not like this where you can walk around and see the other people in your group. If you have never tried it, you definitely need to. VR is so futuristic and needs to be supported.The space escape room itself want too hard... It honestly seemed like it was designed for kids. However it was just plain fun! You can pick things up and throw them around the space station, which just doesn't seem to get old. Escaping the room was almost secondary to the fun space elements.We got out pretty quick and they were nice enough to let us see the horror hospital VR walk through, which was... Interesting.Anyway, based on others reviews here for the physical escape rooms, try them at your own risk. But the VR rooms just seem plain fun."

We stayed after for at least 15-20 minutes just chatting. But what amazed me even more was the husband Stuart invented and built the rooms!

"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-sabotage,1,"Never seen a game like this before. It’s like an escape game but need to get into this suitcase. It looks like a high end movie prop, with keypad on top, and you get some gadgets to pick codes and such. Than it opens to more puzzles and another level and another level. Very clever. The military guy on TV gave some story about evil corporation and we worked on 8 cases at different tables. Ended up helping each other otherwise we probably wouldn’t have finished it in time. Their “secret safe house” was a bit hard to find. Check the address in the email. we went to their main office first but it’s just a block away. No big deal. "

Definitely not a room for newbies to cut their teeth on, unless they're with some seasoned players. We will return to this outfit to try some of the other rooms. A+"
"Escape room ""Outbreak"" by EscapeWorks Denver in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/escapeworks-denver-outbreak,4,"I agree with the other reviews - this room is extremely difficult.

You can tell just from entering the lobby area that there is so much attention to detail and design and it's shown in the rooms as well. We did the Pharoah room. It really felt like an immersive experience. I enjoyed all the puzzles and how they each required different types of thinking with which to solve them.

Don't want to spoil anything so won't give details on what we did, but I will say that you have to work together to get it done (proud to say we finished in about 56 minutes).  The guide (his name was Blue) was awesome, supportive but added some more twists to the game.  Pictures at the end with fun props.  All around great experience and highly recommend.  Tip: we did an early afternoon and did not have to book the whole room, but I'm not sure if that is the way the night time ones are.  We had the joint to ourselves so that was cool too.  Thanks!"

We wanted to solve it on our own so we didn't call for a help clue till we were down to 15 minutes and by then it was too late we didn't have enough time to finish.

This one is a cool cave/forest feel. Really beautifully constructed to transport you into another place. I have previously done The Seance, Gallery, and Heist here and each challenge presents new solutions and methods that I've never experienced before. They really go the extra mile here. We had a great time with five of us in the room. The premise was fun and played on cultural knowledge. It had a mild level of creepiness/darkness which I personally prefer to heighten the excitement. Caitlyn (sp?) was a great hostess. Having the 8pm time slot, I think she let us have an extra 15min because we were on a roll. We really appreciated that because it let us fully discover the room and succeed rather than cue the lights and open the door with remaining unsolved puzzles.

I'm so happy we went to this one. It was fun and detailed and different from any escape room I've been in before! We completed the Saloon Room, and I can say that it was difficult to make all of us think, but also just easy enough for us to get out with 7 minutes to spare. Please please go here! Book a room online or call ahead, the price is well worth the hour given to play and if I'm ever in Flagstaff again I'll be trying to hit this place up."

"Escape room ""Escape the Subway"" by Escape Room Clearwater Beach in Tampa",https://worldofescapes.com/tampa/quests/escape-room-clearwater-beach-escape-the-subway,0,This escape game was amazing.

We will definitely be back to attempt some of the other rooms. Thanks for a great time."
"Escape room ""Blood Thirst"" by Epic Escape Game in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/epic-escape-game-blood-thirst,3,"This was definitely fun! Though we lost Blood Thirst, we had a great time. Kicking ourselves for not listening to our gut about asking for the 1st clue early on, but we did not have a whole group vote on it since our foursome was paired up with another foursome & they did not want it. We almost made it! Ugh! Definitely a return in the works for another room! Staff was super friendly and helpful! Go here, peeps! "
"Escape room ""Blood Thirst"" by Epic Escape Game in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/epic-escape-game-blood-thirst,4,"I played the Dracula game with 4 other people, I felt it was very well crafted. It really is very challenging because it is not intuitive, the game had far too many steps, which were hard to follow. More people do not help because the game stops completely at points while you figure out one particular step. Good luck to any who dare to try it!"

"Escape room ""The Terminal"" by Themescape Escape Rooms in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/themescape-escape-rooms-the-terminal,2,"Our group of 5 did The Terminal room and had a blast. We were so close to finishing! I liked that it was just our group, so we were working with only people we know. Three of the five of us had no experience in an escape room and two of us had a little experience – like one or two times. This was a tricky one – especially finding that first clue. I will say there were a couple of items in the room that had NOTHING to do with the progression of the escape and that threw us because we were sure they were some sort of clue and actually caused us to miss the most important clue. But, the people are super nice and do a great job of explaining what to expect and are good with providing clues when we got stuck."
"Escape room ""Six Shooter Bunk House"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-six-shooter-bunk-house,0,"Went with a group of 5, and we are all old hats at escape rooms. We've probably done about 20 so far in Vegas, St. Louis, Orlando, Phoenix, etc. This room was okay for a Tucson escape room. It was better than two other Tucson rooms we tried last weekend. The decor was very good - It did get you feeling like you were in the old west and there were some fun trinkets to look at. The downside for my group was that the puzzles/clues did not seem realistic - they were quite random and left us wondering things like, ""Why on earth would a person write that bit of info on that item??"" ""Why would a person ever hide that thing in this way?"" The puzzles and clues just weren't realistic at all. So if you are particular about authentic scenarios, you may be a bit underwhelmed here.If you don't care about practical story-lines and game play, then you will probably really enjoy this room!"

We arrived with a group of 10 and did the mad lab. It was everybody's first time so we didn't know what to expect. We all had to sign a waiver and listen to instructions beforehand. You are not allowed to bring phones and purses. You will have to put it in a bin that will be in the same room with you. For the actual escape room, most of the times, we were screaming and scrambling so it was very hard to think while a chained up radioactive professor was chasing you. My heart was pumping pretty fast and my adrenaline was rushing. The mad scientist who was supposed to be our helper and guide, scared us even more! This was definitely not an easy escape room. We didn't make it in the 1 hr limit but it was still so much fun + SCARY! Definitely  check in yelp for the free extra hint because you will need it! Kudos to you if you can solve this escape room with no hints!"

We had a great time. The level of difficulty was challenging but not impossible. We did the ""Mad Lab"" scenario. There is a zombie on a chain and as time ticks by, the chain gets longer. If he touches you they put you in a cell and you have to answer questions to get out. Having this element added to the game definitely made it interesting and kept us on our toes!The staff was nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this one!"

The story, variety of clues and puzzles, and props were all very well done. We also love the fact that its more than one room, you are led into more rooms with more clues which adds so much to the excitement! We found the clues sufficiently challenging, as we had to ask for a couple of hints along the way. The number of puzzles was perfect as we escaped with literally no time to spare. We had such a great time we came back the next night, while we were still in town, and brought another family along with us. The eight of us solved the Diner room. Again, great fun, great puzzles, and a large enough space so we all fit very comfortably and had plenty of different puzzles to work on simultaneously. They are also very competitively priced. Less expensive than some rooms we have visited, yet so much better!We highly recommend Quicksand Escape Games."

I would recommend it to anyone and would give it a 7/10 based on the rooms I’ve completed. My main downside was that I thought the main story didn’t necessarily flow throughout the entire game but still fun and unique puzzles.

"Escape room ""The Pirate's Den"" by MagIQ Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/magiq-room-pirates-den,1,"I did this room with a group of 3, and felt that it was a good number although the GM told us that it would be more tough attempting this room with such a smaller number of people. We felt that the room was okay overall, good for those who are new to escape rooms. It was literally just locks and keys, as we felt that room didn't have a high production value because some of the clues and props just looked out of place. On top of that, when we were inside the room we could hear people talking really loudly outside, which broke our concentration from the room. We had to ask for hints for certain puzzles because we literally had no clue how to solve them, but overall this is a learning experience that I will be taking with me to the next escape room I do. We escaped with about 3 minutes to spare. "

"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,0,"My group did The Basement & The Study and we left both rooms very disappointed.Let me begin by saying that we were extremely excited to do these rooms and we had heard so many good things about it. Long story short we don't think we will ever be coming back to this establishment. Study: The puzzles in the room were fairly basic but then they just became big leaps in logic. There is no direction to this room, and the hint system is at the discretion of the in-room actor, who only hinted 2 things in the room for us. Other than that she would just start yelling directly in our faces, talk about verbal abuse... We will admit that one of our players did break a rule by tossing a pillow in the room which ended up making contact with the actors arm. After which we were all reprimanded over the loud speaker which left a sour mood for all of us for the rest of the room. Do not put your actors in positions where there is no visibility and there is a possibly of them get hurt. An easy way to fix this would be to add a low red hue illuminating the space, that way both the actor and the customers have at least some visibility of what is happening. Frightened people will always have exaggerated reactions to elements unknown, so try to make those elements known. In the rules they are very clear about not climbing on any of the furniture however that is quickly thrown out the window as one of the puzzles requires interaction with some furniture. This had us all very confused as why we deliberately had to break a rule in order to solve the room. Also, throw all sense of safety out the window when you enter this room because you have to do some things that go completely against common sense and better judgement, again there is no direction telling you to do the task you just have to think of the unsafe action and do it yourself. The final puzzle that we got to was ""off by a hair"" as we were told by our game master at the end. This is always frustrating as literally a few millimeters can make the puzzle not work. This could be fixed by adding larger sensors or even making notches so that there are set amounts that triggers can hit. One of the most awkward parts about the end of the game was when the game master entered and asked us ""So how did your lovely actor do in the room?"". It's not an audition, she's already got the role you shouldn't need your customers to give feedback on them while they are in still in the room with you. Because to be honest who is really going to say something bad to the actor when they are right there in the room with you: like ""Yeah well you see she could have done a lot more instead of just standing in the corner and yelling at us"". Onto the pillow thing: Our player realized their mistake and apologized for their reactions but the way the Game Master handled it was unacceptable and unprofessional. She walked us out the lobby, sat us down while she reprimanded all of us about our actions for about 5 minutes saying that she needed a ""verbal confirmation"" from our player that they would ""behave properly"" in the room and that she could have just kicked us out without a refund. Honestly we probably would have been better off with that so that we didn't have to experience not only 1 but 2 terrible rooms. We all put that whole issue aside and we were now ready for the next room with hopes it would be so much better, spoiler alert, we were wrong, it was even worse. We were brought with our group & 4 other randoms into the waiting area where the game master yet again called us out for the pillow thing by saying ""don't throw anything at the actors or anything crazy like that"" while looking directly at us. Seriously?! You already spent time treating us like children and scolding us after the player apologized for their actions, be done with it and move on. The Basement: The entry style to the room was pointless & unnecessary, I guess it adds to the theming & immersion? Felt like a waste to me. The Basement has even less direction than the Study does. Be prepared to turn the whole room upside down in search for things. The flashlights were legitimately falling apart & were horrendously weak. The puzzles were a stretch, some of the visual clues were hard to differentiate: imagine 3 of the exact same locks with a 3 try limit on them. (For both rooms) When we feel like we are struggling we should be able to ask for a clue, it shouldn't be up to the actors to decide if we need it. Oh and in the room was an image of our player who tossed the pillow with the words ""PILLOW THROWER"" on it. Again, with the taunts & belittlement, are you kidding me. Not a way to make us feel comfortable or welcome anymore. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Only reason I give 1 star is for the decor and windows in the Study but even then it was very sparse.Based on our experience I wouldn't be surprised if they try to not let you escape so that you come back and spend another $40 on it."
"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,1,"Came back for The Study yesterday. It was such an amazing experience.Our group made it out 43 seconds before the game was over. In my opinion, it's not as difficult as the Basement, but still it's quite challenging.The Basement has gotten me addicted, so I'm coming back in 2 days for their new room The Elevator Shaft."
"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,2,"Wow, this place is awesome. I was excited the entire time looking for clues, solving puzzles, getting everybody play as a team. Cool!"
"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,3,"I was a little worried that this might turn out to be cheesy but fortunately that was not the case. The atmosphere, acting and details made for a great experience. We did not escape but made it about 94% of the way. Another couple of minutes and we would have made it. Not bad for a bunch of rookies with no escape game experience. We would like to return for the other two chapters in the future."

"Escape room ""Hopper's Cabin"" by Escape Woods in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-woods-hoppers-cabin,1,"This was a lot of fun! We did Hopper's cabin fir the Stranger Things fans out there. They gave us special directions to get to the location which was pretty easy to find. Our game master met us about 15 minutes before our start time. It was a short dark walk to the cabin.  He gave us the instructions inside because it was very cold out. Once we got inside it reminded me of Stranger Things, and it was pretty awesome. The room was freezing but they did have a small heater.We were able to take pics he just asked us not to take pics of the clues, which is completely understandable. We had an hour to complete our task which were were able to. There were 9 ppl in our party.So leaving the venue was difficult probably because it was night time and I believe he said it was a sixty acre farm. Either way he saw us struggling so he called and guided us out."
"Escape room ""Hopper's Cabin"" by Escape Woods in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/escape-woods-hoppers-cabin,2,A bit of a drive to get there but easy to find.  The Christmas Tree  part of the farm was in full swing so we maneuvered around all that traffic and were directed to Hopper's Cabin parking.  We were met and led back to the cabin and the two who had watched Stranger Things were excited!  We were glad they watched in order to complete the last section in the cabin.  Very cool escape game.  We are going to come back and do others!  On the way out looks like they have a petting zoo?!  We were oohing and ahhing over the baby goats.  Now I know where to get pumpkins and Christmas Trees.

Lots of well-designed puzzles and activities with an overall high production value.I've done quite a few escapes and this is the first one where there was a human monitor or guide in the room. I think this takes away from the experience, so that would be my one criticism. Our guide jumped in too often without us asking for help.Other than that, great experience and worth the money!

To start, we found parking right away which is always a plus. The waiting room has tons to do while your'e waiting and the bathroom is in the business, it's not a 1-mile trip through an elaborate maze like some of the other games I played.The scenario: What made this great was the hint system, not to much was information given, but it was just enough to make things clear if you are unsure of your next step. We played as a group of two and it was awesome, but I would definitely recommend four or more to play. The scenario was set up well and we knew our mission.If you find yourself in San Marcos, go to Mighty Awesome, you'll have memories that will last far longer than watching TV in your hotel room."

You are allowed an unlimited amount of clues, but we only used one. After we were done, she came in and went over some of the things we missed/had questions about.Initially, I was a little skeptical to try 60out Escape Room since I had a bad experience with a different company in the past and it left a sour taste in my mouth in regards to escape rooms.

The Escape rooms are one of the best designed. It's definitely challenging and fun.The staff is always so friendly and fun. They certainly make the experience better.I like their membership program, they have cool offers and gifts.My most recent visit was for their new VR game, which we played Escape the Pyramid. Although VR was not completely new for me, playing with a group was a different and unique experience. It had a similar style of challenge of their standard rooms, but it felt a bit easier. I'd still recommend it anyone.It's a bit disappointing that they're limited to only 2 games in VR. I wish they had more options. Since it's digital, it could be potentially unlimited. The employee made it sound like the games/rooms are expected to change every ~2 years. I wish they had more rooms  for more players (more than the 4 it's currently limited to). Until then, I suppose I have to go somewhere else for a new experience?! I"

Unfortunately, the room had some technical issues so we ended up doing the ""Designer's Studio"" instead.Luckily, we weren't disappointed at all. Though the puzzles are mostly gen 1 puzzles, made of locks and other gen 1 mechanics, there were actually gen 1 puzzles that were unique to that room that we had never seen before. I've done almost 150 rooms, and it's always fun to see new puzzles and there were plenty of new ones for me to see this time around too.Their games and wording are quite clever, so pay attention to those.Though the games are private games, I would recommend a team of 2 to 4 for more experience teams, and 4 or more for less experience teams."

"Escape room ""Japanese Thriller"" by Escape Game SD in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-game-sd-japanese-thriller-room,0,"A bit of a difficult room, with a strange set of rules designed to make it a bit horror-themed, such as having to run to a central hallway when the lights flash. The room is certainly not scary.There are 3 rooms, each self-contained. This means that you'll know when you have finished a room. There is then a meta-puzzle to escape.The puzzles mostly had sufficient clues to figure out, but our party of 3 had to ask for a few hints to make sure we were doing the right thing. One puzzle took a long time to slog through, which wasn't particularly exciting. All 3 of us were kept busy figuring things out. The room probably wouldn't be good for large groups, even though they accept up to 9.Not a room for beginners."

Too bad, if it had, it would have been really cool. Some well-designed puzzles. Good for 3-5 players. On the down side, the hint system used a tablet for receiving texts. Players should have their hands free. There are little red stickers on items “not to be interacted with.” -- mostly items on the walls. This just takes away from the immersion experience and these items should be propery secured in place. This is lazy room construction. I hope the company fixes these issues for their new rooms. I do recommend tryning this room. Over all I have fun memories of solving it."

Me and 3 friends. Very cool setup - subtle enough that 4 30 year old+ people probably overthought the clues but straightforward enough that anyone could figure them out. That's to say it was nicely done. Easy to use the website, check in was easy, and the props were simple, if subtle for a ""Nightmare"" scenario.Will try a couple more escape rooms, but also want to come back here and try another room at least. ""Nightmare"" is their easy one and we still needed a lot of hints (hence my comment about my group likely overthinking it a bit)."

The room is non-linear with mini-puzzles are leading to one meta-puzzle, so it's a perfect set-up for larger groups.

We did a team building night in both rooms (one scary, one not) by Mission Escape with 8 people per room. The storylines are fantastic and the mechanics they use are like magic. This goes beyond just hunting for codes to open locks (although plenty of those too!), but they use great technology to make the experience completely immersive. They really want you to succeed, so the progressive storyline is enhanced by the tech to guide you where you need to go so you don't feel completely lost and stuck. And even if you do get stuck they give you just enough hint to get you where you need to go.We screamed, we laughed, we loved every minute!"

Both stories are well thought out and immerse you from minute one. Darkest Hour was a little more simple (in my opinion) but the anticipation and thrilling nature force you to work a littlest more trepidatiously. The puzzles are innovative and unlike some of the puzzles I've seen before, the room is built to change music, lights, and mood of the room as you solve puzzles and progress. Joel was our puzzle master and he was amazing! Very engaging, a great conversationalist, and very supportive. Do yourself a favor and book this room, you'll have a blast!"

Each game had multiple rooms that were decorated is such detail. I was so excited to go in to each new room. The puzzles and clues all made sense and went with the flow. In some escape rooms we've been in, lock codes and clues were REALLY REACHING, but everything here had some sort of relevance. Even though both were very good, my personal favorite was the first one (named Part 1)! You don't have to play the rooms in order.

Plenty of parking and at the end of business complex. Nice waiting room and shared bathroom with the rest of the tenants. First of all I just want to say I was really surprised by this room. This is my first room in Temecula and I was not expecting much at all. I just assumed this was going to be your typical cheap looking escape room in a generic office building. I was very wrong.Once you walk into the room it looks like a study.  Full of maps and books and chests. There are hidden compartments and a lot of surprises in this room that I did not expect one bit. Uncle Thaddius's Attic is full of little clues and the attention detail is commendable. The second part of the room is a nice change of tone from the first one and really represents the secret nature of Uncle Thaddius and as a result, the mystery of everything adds so much to the experience.Immersion FactorOnce I started exploring Uncle Thaddius's Attic I was completely in.

Our wives were taken into a separate room and we had to rescue them and then continue all together. Don't want to give any too many details, but it was fun and challenging. The hardest part was that they didn't really tell us anything from the beginning. We just had to figure out what we needed to do. You get locked in a room with no instructions except to get out. A lot of fun, would totally recommend for groups of friends or team building activities for businesses. I was a little worried that you would have to be a genius puzzle solver.

Production design was good and the room had some extremely clever ways for activating circuits and opening doors and boxes that had both of us oohing and aahing. Currently clues are asked for through a walkie-talkie, though they are working to upgrade the clue system in that room (which is good because they walkie-talkie did seem to keep picking up someone else’s transmission!).But. We didn’t always feel like we knew what we were supposed to be doing. The flow of the puzzles was a bit scattered and the storyline unclear. It’s wasn’t always clear to us what we were solving or why were solving it that way. Or even how we actually got out of the room. The game seemed to just stop. When talking to Noel and Stephan afterward, they explained the actual escape scenario. We looked at each other and realized…we hadn’t actually done that!They are also very open to feedback–possibly more so than any other company we’ve been to. They sat us down with more tea and biscuits (of course) and had a conversation with us about what we liked, what could be improved, and our general sense of the room.

"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/The-Cellar-Key-Quest-F,0,"This is a work in progress, but was good for the price.  The ""serial killer"" theme was well done and the puzzles are as expected for an escape room.  Without spoilers, they include looking for things with black lights, organizing clues, and opening lock boxes using various clues given to you.This is in an empty birthday party room devoted for the escape room experience, and had a creepy vibe, especially given the halloween party decorations that are part of the puzzle.  This location seems geared to kids, although this was slightly too scary and too hard for most children. The organization says that they have been visiting other escape rooms in Orange County, and are tinkering with and changing things here to make it better and better.  It may be worth it to wait a few months until a new experience is announced.  But for the much lower price compared to other escape rooms, this is worth it if you are in the area."

The staff did not seem to care at all that we were struggling.  The Wild West rooms were too dark for 3/4 of our group to see the clues/puzzles. Did not get the sense that they were watching our progress and were willing to help us.   The staff members were like robots in and out of the room.  Didn't adjust their words at all to have a conversation with us/make us feel welcome/seem like they cared about our experience.  One of the clues was not reset properly, wasting our time (we solved a puzzle to open something, and there was nothing there. The ""hidden"" object was sitting out in the open the whole time. The rooms were dirty and we were looking for clues in amongst dust/hair. I had a much better experience at a smaller business that really seemed to care about our enjoyment of the room and was watching us closely and ready to suggest that we use a clue so we'd finish in time. It would have been lovely if this game master had turned up the lights or allowed us to use our phones' flashlights so that we could see better and have a chance of completing the room.  We also did not know how many rooms the puzzle involved, so we thought we were on track to finish and then discovered there was a whole other larger room with the majority of the work in it.  This room is advertised as good for beginnners, but you need a large group with young eyes to complete this room if you are beginners. Our group was obviously not ready for this room, but I really think that there were issues with our experience separate from our insufficient puzzle-solving abilities. "

The staff is awesome, they really know if you need help or not. Don't miss it if you are in San Jose!"
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room San Jose in San Jose",https://worldofescapes.com/san-jose/quests/paniq-escape-room-san-jose-wild-west,5,"I've done many escape rooms in the Bay Area, and so far this is my favorite!First: the design is top notch. The Paniq team did an amazing job, you actually feel like you're back in the 1800s. Also the puzzles are extremely well thought out! Having done more than 30 rooms myself, I've barely seen any of those puzzles anywhere else.10/10"
"Escape room ""Mystery of the Black Dahlia"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-mystery-of-the-black-dahlia,0,"I had a long drive in Florida and was looking for a game to do along the way, I stopped my search at Escape Cocoa Beach. The owners were awesome. I could tell before I started the room it would be a good one (I can usually tell based on the attitude of the person that greets me).      At this point I've done around 40 rooms and I always think I'm going to crush it.... and I am always wrong. The owner Ryan put some real thought into his puzzles and when a puzzle is solved you feel rewarded instead of frustrated. I love when I ask for a hint and it isn't something ridiculous, instead it was a cleverly place clue that I overlooked.    What was really amazing was the actually scenario. All four of his rooms follow an actual historic event. I did the Black Dahlia and I was impressed that the story, puzzles, props and atmosphere all blended together. Nothing was off.  I would definitely love to go back to Cocoa beach to do their other rooms. Once I reached the 20 room mark I stopped trying to rush through them for the best time and started to enjoy the immersion and scenario. This is why Escape Coca Beach is getting 5 - stars from me. The moment you enter the room you can see the passion and hard work that went into creating an amazing event."
"Escape room ""Mystery of the Black Dahlia"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-mystery-of-the-black-dahlia,1,The building is so unique and clean! I love the decorations as well. We played Black Dahlia and it was definitely a mind twister. I would 100% go back again!!! Also I love how they have unlimited clues!! Would recommend(:
"Escape room ""Mystery of the Black Dahlia"" by Escape Cocoa Beach in Melbourne",https://worldofescapes.com/melbourne/quests/escape-cocoa-beach-mystery-of-the-black-dahlia,2,"Such a great experience, loved the room (Black Dahlia) and our host was very welcoming and informative. He helped us when we needed it and was super friendly. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun/challenging activity."
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-island-escape,0,"Falls Church, Virginia is actually where Breakout Games DC is located.  Falls Church is an independent city in the commonwealth of Virginia.  It is included in the Washington DC metropolitan area.  Since Breakout Games already has a few Virginia locations, they decided to brand their name ""Breakout Games DC"" to attract more customers. There's plenty of parking right in front of the facility.  The entrance to the lobby is located on the 2nd floor.  Like their other locations, there's plenty of seating with complimentary water and merchandise available.  From a décor aspect, we do feel Timonium, MD feels newer.  There's a total of 6 escape games at this location.  ESCAPETHEROOMers picked ""Island Escape"" as it's the only one that we were able to fit into our schedule.After a quick debrief, we were sent to an island to enjoy our vacation.  Little did we know, that a volcano is about the explode on this island and of course everyone else evacuated already except for us.  With only one boat left available for departure, we have to find the keys to safely evacuate before the lava covers the land.  This room is pretty linear and you really can't move on until you solve a puzzle which leads to the next one.  The room size is also pretty good for just the two of us.  I would say a max of 4 people would be comfortable for this game as anymore may feel a bit cramped. You also probably won't need that many people on one puzzle.  Although the room's décor stuck to the theme of the island feel with its art and props, we still felt like we were just in a room.  The puzzles did stick with the theme throughout, but it was all within the ""classic"" types of puzzles.  There was one particular prop that gave the room a bit of a ""pop"", but it would've been great to see a bit more innovation on the puzzle design.  We were stuck on some puzzles at the beginning as traditionally we would probably didn't think about reusing something, but this was quickly realized after our first hint.  We got out with a minute to spare with just the two of us.  There's definitely a good amount of puzzles in there so I wouldn't waste time. This room would be a fun family room as I could see some kids logically solving most of it.We felt very ""refreshed"" after this room and had a sudden urge to go on vacation only to realize our next stop is yet, another escape room.  No complaints here! Escapees for life!  Breakout Games also has escape games that can be delivered to the comfort of your own home called ""Dispatch"".  We recently received our package and we're eager to unbox and share our thoughts with you guys soon!  "
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-island-escape,1,We went mid week and tried the island room. It was our first escape room and gave us a run for our money. Angel was our game master and was perfect with his clues and orientation. He spoke a bit quickly that I felt a bit pressured. Overall a great experience and looking forward to going back
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-island-escape,2,If I ever were to get stuck on a volcanic island with a group of strangers it would be THIS group! Our game master was amazing as I appreciated all of the clues and good sense of humor. He didn't mislead us and provided just enough clues to enable our team to escape at 53:20. If you want to do a fun team building activity for your group at work or even a non-profit I would highly recommend going to an escape room. You will learn a lot about each other! Luckily we broke out and didn't kill each other as we worked together on a common goal! 
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-island-escape,3,"So much fun! I will definitely be back with friends.  My favorite thing about is that each room is yours entirely. My group and I did the room where you were trapped on an island and had to get off before the volcano errupted. We thankfully got out.  What is interesting about this particular escape is that there were no level of difficulty. The staff said each room was basically the same level. If that's the case, I would have never gotten out if it weren't for the numerous clues that they gave whenever we were stuck. My friend that I did it with said she thought the room was really hard. I really appreciated our game master- he was quite humerous in his clues."
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - D.C. in Washington, D.C.",https://worldofescapes.com/washington/quests/breakout-games-dc-island-escape,4,"The theme of the breakout room that I did was island escape. It was very challenging tons of locks to open but we broke out in time! Our game master, the guy who gives us clues was very energetic which got us more in the spirit for the game!I highly recommend checking Breakout Games out!"
"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/key-quest-miami-detention,0,"Nice place, good stuff and really competitive prices. Thinking outside the box is definitely needed. We've visited Detention and Vacation Vandals. The area of the games is rather small and the interiors could be more sophisticated. Anyway, I recommend Key Quest escape rooms. Creative and logical riddles and interesting plots can be found there. Gifts for winners have been a nice surprise for us. :) Also, we've enjoyed laser games."
"Escape room ""Detention"" by Key Quest in Miami",https://worldofescapes.com/miami/quests/key-quest-miami-detention,1,"Fun times, love this place!"

"Escape room ""Rampancy"" by Denver Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/Denver-Escape-Room-Rampancy,0,"I went with a group of three friends and joined another couple for the hardest room, ""Rampancy"". Our minds were put to the test as we conquered patterns and solved logic puzzles. The clues were helpful but not obvious, the puzzles all made sense, and we almost finished which we were extremely proud of. 10 more minutes would have resulted in an ever so satisfying victory. I will definitely be bringing friends again to tackle another task. Highly recommended for anyone with a sense of adventure."
"Escape room ""Rampancy"" by Denver Escape Room in Denver",https://worldofescapes.com/denver/quests/Denver-Escape-Room-Rampancy,1,Had so much fun and this was the first time ever doing this!

The guys that did the room with us were great considering we did not meet them until yesterday. I recommend it to any couple or friends who are looking for something unique and fun"
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,0,We came to 60out for our yearly team building day and we had so much fun! We got the Hangover room and escaped. It was awesome! Our team consisted of five and none of us have ever done an escape room so we considered this a win! Highly recommend and Victoria was great!
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,1,The Hangover was my 38th room. This room was decorative and set the scene up for the story. It made me feel like I was immersed in the story quite well. The puzzles were actually fun to do and were quick and on a whim type of solving. No real scavenger hunt in here which was nice and towards the end waa my favorite part because of the props we had to use in order to get out. Loved all of it.
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,2,"We had some minor tech hiccups in this room, but our game master was able to fix things for us quickly. We had to do something physical in this room that we've never done before, which was super cool! It's a pretty tech-heavy room and uses almost all your senses. I don't think there were any traditional lock-key puzzles (though I could be wrong). The end is incredibly clever!"
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,3,The set decor is mind blowing. The puzzles are intuitive and fun. Highly recommended. My friend runs an escape room of her own and she had a blast as well. 
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,4,"We did the new Hangover room. It was lots of fun and we really enjoyed it.At first, I was a reluctant Escape Room virgin but I am so glad I gave this a try. The reason I was initially hesitant is because I don't like places where I can't get out, and I don't like being scared. Haunted houses and being mid row in any arena is my nightmare.These games are terrific because they help you work together as a team while tapping into out of the box thinking and communication skills. I look forward to an opportunity to try another escape room.My friends said this was one of the better ones they have been to in LA and Phoenix."

So far we've done The Inventor's Garage, Sweet Dreams and the Lost Continent, all with a different mix of people. I'm thoroughly impressed with the thoughtful design of each of the rooms and all of the puzzles are unique. The decorations in the room match the story lines perfectly. I've met both owners now and they're equally friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the escape room experience and Epic Escape Game in particular."

The puzzles were the right amount of challenging, and they throw in some fantastic twists that made it even better. We hadn't even left the parking lot before we started planning our next trip back. I can't recommend it enough!"

I've done two other rooms in the past (which are AMAZING), but the new Humana Experience was so much fun...and less stressful due to the drinks and social time. Have a drink, solve a room...eat a taco and have another drink...try another room, etc. etc. etc. Best of all, on Humana night, you can keep trying until you solve! Also, as always the actors are phenomenal! My boyfriend and I beat all the mini-rooms, so in addition to winning little trinkets, you get 20% off your next booking, which has to be purchased on the spot...and we did! I think we'll go for the Elevator Shaft next!You ROCK The Basement, and best of all you're only 7 minutes from my house!"

If you like problem-solving then this is definitely a must try. Can't wait to go back and do the second room!

"Escape room ""The Dark Wizard’s Curse"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-the-dark-wizards-curse,0,"The wizards curse room is awesome, I loved the themed room. it was very well done."
"Escape room ""The Dark Wizard’s Curse"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-the-dark-wizards-curse,1,"This is a new venue for Meridian, Idaho and it's a keeper. A group of 6 women who felt we were pretty smart and capable solved several problems but failed at the given task of escaping. This was a first attempt by 5 of us, the 6th had done one in another state. We had an absolute ball learning we know less than we dreamed. It's a great escape for a group to play, interact and try to figure things out. Make this one of your events when you are in the area. It's time well spent."
"Escape room ""The Dark Wizard’s Curse"" by Escape from Mystery Manor in Boise",https://worldofescapes.com/boise/quests/escape-from-mystery-manor-the-dark-wizards-curse,2,"I played The Dark Wizard's Curse with a group of 5. Four of us were veterans, having played over 100 different rooms. The hosts were very nice, seemed to really appreciate escape rooms, and were pleasant to talk with. Owners are newer to the business, maybe haven't been to many top rooms, and that seems to have shown through slightly in the game design and puzzles. That doesn't take a lot away from my rating, since that is typical of a smaller market independent locations. We enjoyed ourselves throughout, we came into this expecting a certain experience and that was delivered. We will definitely be back for the other room, but that is mostly because it is the only room in the whole Treasure Valley we haven't yet tried.The rest of this review is mostly for other veterans, since 95% of reviews tend to not be truly helpful when needing to choose between multiple escape room options:The set clearly took a lot of work, and gives a grand first impression, but I question if that effort was placed in the right areas. I'd have liked for the themed decor to be more purposeful and integrated into the puzzles more than it was, the result was just more red herrings. Puzzles were not as intuitive or satisfying as I would hope (more than once did we say a variation of the following: ""I guess try this answer...oh, that worked!?""); and the ending was slightly anti-climactic. I'd put The Dark Wizard's Curse at about the 40th percentile for the rooms in Treasure Valley."

I went with a group of 6 and I felt like I wasn't doing anything in certain parts of this room because there was no space for me. I admit that some of the puzzles I could not figure out but luckily for me my teammates were really smart about this. I would recommend this room for anyone who is looking for a challenge because this room definitely got me thinking a lot.

The puzzles are very challenging but never unfair. Some of them are pretty ingenious and they all stuck with the theme very well. Basically if you want to feel like Tom Hanks in the Da Vinci Code but without the awkward mullet, this is the place to go. I did this with 6 other experienced escapees and we still got out right at the 75 minute mark (or so the game master Sheryl tells us. She definitely played up the drama and was very helpful overall). I'm looking forward to trying the two other rooms at this location."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,3,I recently did the Da Vinci room with my friends and it was easily one of the best rooms I've ever done.  I thought the 75 minutes might feel too long but it was perfect considering the huge amounts of amazing/difficult puzzles which perfectly fit the theme of the room. Sheryl was definitely one of the best game masters I've ever had at any escape room I've been to.
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,4,"This is a beautiful room but it is really hard. Since the puzzles are so different, it took us some time to understand what to do. We spent a lot of times on puzzles we thought we could solve faster. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to get through this but there are plenty of others who have finished this room within that time frame. We had a group of 6 and when time ran out we were told we still had a few more puzzles to complete. Even though I am salty about the loss, I still highly recommend this room to the seasoned escape room goer."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,5,"We have done about a dozen escape rooms (from 60out as well as a couple other companies) and this is honestly the hardest room that I have ever done. The room had tons of unique puzzles, not just lock and key. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to solve all of the puzzles. Even though we got tons of hints we were unable to escape. Despite this, we still had a lot of fun. I would recommend Da Vinci for escape room pros and bigger groups (maybe 4-6 people) so that each person can work on different puzzles at the same time."

Enjoyed it very much, and hope to do many more in the future! The staff was very nice and helpful."

It is amazing how much detail they put into the room! We did the Spec Ops room and it was a lot of fun. The clues were put together well and you didn't have to be a mind reader to get out. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because our room did have some technical difficulties. We didn't know if we were doing something wrong or if it was the room. At the end of the game, a manager came and apologized. He even gave us a free game for another day. I would come back even if it wasn't free, can't wait to try a new room!"

The staff is friendly, and professional. The whole feel of the place is very modern, especially the use of technology in the games which was very impressive. They do seem to be a little more expensive than other escape rooms, but I definitely think the price is worth it. We played special ops and escaped with only 2 minutes, we had a group of 6 and were definitely challenged but still had a blast!! They also do a great job with letting you know you can always hit a button to leave the room for a restroom break, which is perfect for anyone who is anxious about the general concept of these games."

We escaped the Study With 0.01 secs left! Our Detective was helpful and we were the first group he ever had to escape. We are taking down that 23% escape rate one room at a time. We are coming back to do the hotel next!
"Escape room ""The Study"" by Mission: Escape Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mission-escape-atlanta-the-study,6,"This place is awesome! If you're looking for a mind-stimulating group activity, then this is the activity for you to try out. Price: $28Parking: Located in a little office strip behind Atlantic Station, so there really isn't much worry about parking on the weekend (not sure about weekdays though).This was my first time in an escape challenge and I enjoyed it a lot! The max. number of people for a time slot is 10. We had 6 people in our group (all new to the escape challenge concept), and another party of 4 bought the remaining 4 tickets (quite experienced with the escape challenge). I think 10 people is a bit much since the actual room is not that big, but I guess it makes sense from a business perspective. I suggest going in a group of around 6 people, although you cannot control whether other people buy the remaining tickets in your time slot. The staff are great and friendly and the guy who plays the detective is super into his role, which sets the mood for the challenge. They're working on ""The Hotel"" where individuals have to escape their individual rooms before they join their group; I look forward to coming back to try that then!"
"Escape room ""The Study"" by Mission: Escape Atlanta in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/mission-escape-atlanta-the-study,7,"So definitely one of the better escape games I've played, what I loved was the fact all the puzzles were relevant to the scenario - they even added a few that were totally new and funny. Most of the clues were really logical if not always intuitive (that's a good thing) - so a super prepared group could definitely have gone through the room without burning up a single clue/ hint (you are given 3). In all great experience - I did it with a totally new'b group and they had the time of their life.Suggestions - The PA system needs to be louder, and maybe not so many hints? (but that's just me)."
