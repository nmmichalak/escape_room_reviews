"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,0,"Dynamic Escape Rooms has come up with a great game idea. An escape room with varying degrees of challenges. You can chose medium, hard, or extreme depending on how experienced or brave you are! And apparently even if you chose one style one time, when you come back to do another style, you don't play it the same way, so it's almost like a completely different room. We chose the medium Deja Vu and it was just right for us. You don't have to be a Doctor Who fan to do this room. It just adds to the fun and the geekiness if you are. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this room. The decor is great and It was a very fun experience. Our gamemasters were Ignacio and Adam. Ignacio knew exactly when to give nudges and hints, making him one of the best gamemasters we have ever had. (Thx, Ignacio!) Also, Adam is one of the best front lobby people. He is also available on the website for a chat if you have questions. (Thx, Adam!) If you want to play a private room, you don't need to ""buy out"" the rest of the spots. You only pay $30 extra to make it yours alone! The lobby and restrooms were clean and uncluttered. This room would appeal to all ages, sci-fi fans, Doctor Who fans, puzzle fans, game fans. In other words, if you like escape games, we recommend this business to anybody and everybody, travelers and locals alike!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,1,"This was my first ‘escape room’ experience and the team at Dynamic Escape Rooms have set the bar very high. Initially I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of being locked in a room and forced to escape, but was immediately comforted by the amazing staff that assured me that this wasn’t the typical escape room. I could leave and take a break as needed, the door wasn’t locked, and to think of it as an interactive experience instead. And it was just that. I was amazed at the complexity and range of the puzzles in the room and the imaginative story line that linked the entire experience together. I first played at the medium level of the Time Machine Game, my team and I barely completed it on time, but felt we could definitely complete the hard level now that we were familiar with the layout. We couldn’t have been more wrong. I was amazed at how much more complex and different the puzzles had become with a change in levels, needles to say we did not complete the level on time. I will definitely be back and will be recommending Dynamic Escape Rooms to all of my friends. Great Job Dynamic!!!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,2,"WOW! What an amazing experience! I have been waiting for so long for a great escape room experience. I have been to escape rooms in Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix, none compared to Dynamic. The staff is professional, courteous and helpful. The room can be set at different levels, I can't wait to go back and try a harder level! I definitely recommend checking out Dynamic Escape Rooms to all looking for a fun and immersive challenge! Great job Dynamic Escape Rooms staff and creators can't wait to go back!"

"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,1,"We took part in the Museum Heist game. 2 adults and 2 15 yr old boys. This was the most fun we've had in a while. You are locked in a room with clues that you have to figure out in an hour in order to escape the room and get the picture to prove you got out in time. The clues are some common sense, some general math and problem-solving. We visited 2 other game rooms with other companies and this one is by far the best. I am so glad they opened up in Montgomery. They are also located in a great side of town!!"
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,2,"I went here with my family.

"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,0,"After doing 50+ rooms, this is one of my all-time favorite rooms. Unique puzzles that fit the themes nicely. The cleanest design I have ever seen and was esthetically beautiful. A mix of modern and traditional elements. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the booking process. I am usually not a fan of walkie-talkies for hints. However, the walkie-talkies used were simple, worked well, and hints were given quickly demonstrating that the game master was tracking our progress carefully. Lock Down delivers a solid A+ escape room experience which can be a rare find these days."
"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,1,Very fun! We did Chem lab and Samurai tonight (beat the Samurai record!). Clean location. Great employees. Great rooms!

"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,4,"There are a wealth of great room escape options in the East Valley and Lockdown rates among or at the top of the list.  Our team completed the Theft and Samurai rooms and were thoroughly impressed by each of them.  The puzzles are clever, engaging, and challenging.  Better yet, they truly feel as if they are organic and belong in their environments.  What sets Lockdown apart from other escape rooms is their commitment and attention to a particular aesthetic.  They have realized that challenge does not have to detract from the overall immersion of a room escape experience.  Their design principles are a welcome change from the many rooms where escaping the zombie apocalypse, a fallout shelter, or an alien research facility requires the unlocking of a half dozen bike locks.Lockdown is a challenging, affordable, and engaging option for a group room escape.  Their staff is friendly, enthusiastic, and welcoming.  We will surely be back to enjoy their other experiences."

"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-island-escape,2,"We went to the Island Escape room. They had a really fun theme and room design and a lot of new and novel puzzles that were well engineered. The staff was friendly, engaging and on top of monitoring our progress. The communication was clear and easy to understand.Cons:Some of the puzzles were huge leaps of logic. One of the first ones took us about 15 minutes to figure out and we had to use one of our three clues. A few tweaks on it would have made it much more understandable. After we won, the room leader came in and told us that a lot of people get caught up on it. If that's the case, then it's probably the puzzle that needs fixing. I don't like the feeling of being stuck on the first puzzle! I wish they had given me a few more wins before a big stall.This experience puts this room at the middle of the pack of my escape room experiences, but I do hope they continue to refine the puzzles because the room could be great!"
"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-island-escape,3,Great adventure for the whole family!!

For those looking for a small-group challenge, play Inventor's Secret. Larger groups will want to play Burned Out. I particularly enjoyed the mini-escape room that they offered in their lobby. This was only the second instance of that idea that I've found in Arizona and I wish more locations offered it as an intro and lobby time-killer."

After booking the room, we realized it was also the most difficult, but we decided we were up for the challenge.  The staff here was also great!  Since we were newbies, he spent some time letting us know how it works and then went on to tell us the back story of our game. We were to discover the clues to unlock our door and to save the city from being flooded.  We were allowed 3 hints during our hour game, which we did use.  There were five of us and the game was definitely difficult but we escaped with only minutes to spare.  So much fun and we can't wait to return and try the other rooms!"

There were enough red herrings to keep us going down a rabbit hole or two without overwhelming us with useless items and meaningless clues.

My husband and I have done over 20 escape rooms, and we must say that this is our new favorite room. Megan did a great job as our cluemaster. We were lucky enough to do this room on our own which we prefer. (Too many cooks...and all that). This room had all sorts of unique puzzles and lots of good old-fashioned locks. And lots and lots of books, of course. This franchise allows you to take as long as you need to finish the game, which is always appreciated. We can't wait for their new room to open! If you like escape rooms, put this room at the top of your ""must-do"" list. You won't be disappointed."

And the puzzles were challenging and engaging, but not so ridiculous that no sane person could ever conceivably ever reach that end conclusion on their own accord.  Plus, there are a couple of bonus action items in the game that made our group exclaim in delight and surprise!  This was an extremely well thought out room and a completely delightful way to spend an hour.  I will return and I can't wait until they open another room!"

The Sleuth Box and Escape Zone AZ are probably my favorite two escape businesses I've visited so far, in regards to the atmosphere, the details of the puzzles, and how they're incorporated into the room.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."

"Escape room ""Rush Hour"" by Escape Zone in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-zone-rush-hour,1,"We did the Rush hour room. I did like how it's not linear, meaning you can be working on different things at different times. There were 3 of us in the room and I think that was enough. It is a small room, but it's meant to be on a train. They had screens that showed the city of Tempe passing by like you were on the light rail. Very nice touch. We all enjoyed the escape room and made it out with 10 minutes to spare and didn't even use all our clues!! WOOHOO!!Can't wait to try the other rooms there.Well decorated room and the staff was friendly and fun."

The room was really fun and it had a lot of unique puzzles. Though we enjoyed the room and I recommend trying it, I would not recommend the room to beginners. We have done around 25 rooms, and this one was pretty tricky. We will definitely be back for their other rooms!"

I'm thinking, ""there's an hour of my life I'll never get back."" Boy, was I wrong!This was SO much fun! It was a challenge both to get the clues, but also to work cooperatively!

We did the zookeeper room since we had our 8 year old and 3 year old with us and it was perfect. Our 3 year old was busy with all the animal things in the room and the rest of us were busy solving our mission. Nothing like a room for 6-12 year olds to make an adult feel a little less than though haha Hands down recommend this for anyone who wants to be fully engulfed in a game and have fun.

We didn’t escape but our game host, Luke, was great and took the time to show us the last three puzzles we missed. I have played escape games at other locations and in my opinion this room had difficult but logical clues that clearly led you to the next puzzle - not all rooms are like this. My teenage son can’t wait to play at this location again!"
"Escape room ""The New Atlantis"" by Huntsville Escape Rooms in Huntsville",https://worldofescapes.com/huntsville/quests/huntsville-escape-rooms-the-new-atlantis,1,"We recently did the New Atlantis. It is the only room we have done here since we don't live in Huntsville. We love escape rooms, probably having done about 15 in total. I am amazed that this is a local business, because it is as high a quality as many of the larger chain escape rooms. It was a really well thought out room, I would say one of my favorites of all time. It was challenging, one of the tougher rooms I have done, but with some clues and good help we escaped. We will definitely be back to try the other rooms someday. I think our game master's name was Chloe. She was fantastic. Lots of fun."

"Escape room ""Amazon Rainforest"" by International Room Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-amazon-rainforest,1,"After doing now 60 escape rooms, the Amazon room is definitely one the neatest set designs I have seen so far. You can definitely tell that a lot of work went into it to make it as immersive as possible. Please take note though that I played with 2 other people and some of the puzzles would be easier to achieve with 1 or maybe two more people. Also attention to detail is needed for this room as it is easy to miss items you are needing to find in order to do some of the puzzles. Our game master Aly was fun and refreshingly enthusiastic! Thank you for the fun experience!"

They are quite deserving of their High Production Value/Immersive award that they won for their Amazon Rainforest room. From start to finish, that room was one of my all-time favorites. So much attention to detail and overall fun. And the price is even lower than other Escape Rooms. Their Gravitational Effect room was a step-down in puzzle quality, though the interior design was still above-average. I especially enjoyed the physical dynamic in the middle room. Gift shops usually put me off, but in the lobby you can buy beautiful flowers hand-made by the owner. It was a nice touch.Games played: Amazon Rainforest, Gravitational Effect"

Perfect mix of modern and unique traditional elements nicely themed. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and polite.

The staff are so friendly and personable, we've come back to do all of their rooms. We've talked to our other friends to bring different groups to try out their rooms, too.Specifically reviewing Blaine's Basement: You should definitely go in the evening when it's darker out. It definitely adds to the creepiness of the room. Unfortunately, our group did not escape Blaine's Basement (because we were so terrified of the darkness in the room). But when we told our other friends to do it, they escaped and loved it. One of our favorites rooms in all of Arizona.Definitely recommend their ""Quest for the Throne"" and ""Condo"" rooms also.

The staff is super friendly and accommodating, and also very helpful.Our group of 12 split in two groups, one doing the Mystery Mansion and the other called Do Not Disturb, which I was a part of.  We had so much fun with this in a ""hotel room"" theme trying to track down a kidnapper who had us trapped in the room. Trying to find clues and get out of there in one hour is a challenge but we had a blast. We didn't quite breakout, but were very close! The staff even helped along the way. They gave us 3 free clues we could ask for at any time if we were stumped. After we finished, we even went next door to get pictures taken, which is always fun.All in all, a super cool venue in Birmingham. I highly recommend coming here and hope to be back soon bringing some friends! A big thanks to Jeremy for arranging and helping make it a fun day."

"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-spellbound,1,"Our group have completed around 15-20 escape rooms in Arizona and ""Spellbound"" is our consensus favorite room. The attention to detail and the design of the room is amazing. They definitely spent money creating this room.It was very challenging and we escaped with less than 3 minutes on the clock. But we have a pretty great group of six that work together really well. Wouldn't recommend this room for beginners, but once you've done a couple, you have to check out this room. Since completing ""Spellbound"", we compare every room we do to this one, and unfortunately, nothing compares to this room. Very friendly staff at Mind Spark, too."

"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,0,"I'm the Owner of Escape Game Alaska and regarding Julie's review, I just want to share this because I clearly remember the two of them as customers. I would never feel the need to write this but I do feel that, as business owners, we live in a world where customers are able to review us but we, as business owners, are not given the opportunity to respond. While I am grateful to have customers play and avidly try to make it through the game, I also need to ensure that my prop decor, investments in making the rooms authentic and detailed, and game pieces do not get damaged- so that other players can play the game as well. During the game, it was clear that there was not a lot of respect for the facility or objects in the game room. (NOTE: some of the books in the rooms are antiques that were gifted to us with the intent of us caring for them; I intend to uphold that responsibility. As well, if a game piece is damaged, it can impact the game experience of people who are scheduled to play following that game). During game play, I observed the two of them dropping and damaging items in the room, kicking gaming pieces with their feet to move them after they'd dropped them on the floor and walking on top of materials. This is not how many of our participants and visitors play. While it may have appeared that I was ushering them out of the room with the intent of going to lunch; I did not go to lunch (despite the fact that I'm quite sure many other humans do)- I just didn't want to have them play any other games especially not our Gold Rush room which is stocked with many items that are over 110 years old. Regarding the difficulty of the game, while experienced gamers may make it out with time on the clock, there are still a lot of players in our area that have never played a game before and we work to ensure that all gamers escape. Our escape games are different (we note that 'everyone escapes' on our website) and we think that people enjoy the positive experience. While we can't please everyone, we do think preservation of the experience for other players is more important than allowing our games to be damaged for solely two people. While input is always appreciated, as business owners, we weigh out cost and benefit on a regular basis. It was my decision that it was potentially more costly to have the two of them play another game than it was beneficial. As well, if our experience was so bad, I'm not sure why the two of them asked to play another game. "
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,1,"The game itself was enjoyable, if shorter than we were used to. My sister and I got out with 20 minutes to spare and we looked through every inch of space in the room (which, for anyone that’s done a hard escape room before, is the trademark of an experienced team. You have to go through everything to avoid missing an “obvious” clue). The woman running the show was the reason for the bad review. She had her boyfriend stop in before we entered the room and told him that after she was finished here that they could grab food. She’s allowed to have a personal life, sure, but shooing customers out the door after they beat the game saying she has “a thing to do” is just unprofessional. We told her that we had an interest in doing another game (there were no bookings after us) and she told us that she it was doable with 2 people, but she “would rather not have [us] in that room because *this* (gestures around to the scattered items of the room) can’t happen in that room”...it was extremely rude. Then she went on to complain about how LONG it’s going to take her to clean up and that she’s never seen this level of “disaster” in the room before. The staff was unprofessional and I’ve never felt the need to leave a scathing review for anyone. Ever. Feel free to enjoy the game itself, but don’t get in the way of the employee’s free time..."

I did their ""Pawn Shop"" room, which was lots of fun and I would consider pretty difficult - but in fairness most of the difficulty came from us overthinking the problems.  ;)  It's run by a husband and wife that are very passionate about it - and even go so far as to make the different gadgets in the rooms - any place that casually mentions doing things with Arduino's gets an automatic bonus from me.Overall a great location and a great place to take a date, family or company to do something a bit more memorable an interactive than just going out for drinks or a movie.

"Escape room ""Curse on the Emerald Seas"" by Puzzle Effect Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/the-puzzle-effect-phoenix-curse-on-the-emerald-seas,2,"I just finished their two new rooms, The Path and Curse on the Emerald Sea, at their new location and I must say that they were both quite well done and very indicative of the care they put into the business. Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."

This was our first time at Eludesions and we had heard that in Arizona, they probably average the largest sized rooms. It didn't disappoint! The design, props, decoration, and interactive puzzles we're very fun, tricky, and unique. We were definitely helped by our game master, as we got stuck in a couple parts, which after receiving a clue, it all made sense. So if you're used to letter locks and combo locks, you'll be challenged in this room. I would definitely recommend this room! The staff were very laid back and fun. Also, I spoke with a female staff member over the phone regarding a question I had, and she was very helpful in helping me find an answer. Then to my surprise, Bob the owner, calls me back regarding this question, and clarified the answer. He's definitely someone who's business I would like to support.

It was almost like walking onto the set of Legends of the Hidden Temple. It really sold the atmosphere of being inside a temple, and aside from a bit of a very minor frustration with one specific searching puzzle I had no real issues of note. I will definitely be back for their Bill and Ted and Terminator rooms and will be recommending them to all my friends who like escape rooms. If you are looking for a really well done room I recommend Escape Westgate, you'll have a fantastic time. Plus one the owners look like Michael Douglas so that a bonus!"

We loved it so much that we stayed and did Time Warp right after (there was an open slot). We have done multiple escape rooms in both Hawaii and Mississippi. Escape Dothan is by far the best one we have been to so far. The people that work the rooms allow you to struggle some before they give you hints. They don't make it too easy to get out!

"Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-noras-nightmare,2,"Played Nora's Nightmare yesterday and, it turned out, we were the first group to play the room since it officially opened.  As enthusiasts (almost 200 rooms played), we're always hesitant to try a brand new game as we've quickly learned it's much better to give them some time (even after beta testing) to fine tune things and make sure it runs they way they intended. But since we were jonesing for a room, we decided to go for it. From the first point of contact, via FB messenger, their customer service was spot on. The owner (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name) was friendly, very accommodating and responded to my inquiries quickly. As for the room, we enjoyed it quite a bit! I loved the unique theme and really liked the thought and details that were put into the aesthetics of the room. The puzzles are a good mix of lock & key as well as some tech so it should easily appeal to a variety of players. They are not overly difficult but they do still provide a good challenge and make you slow down to think. We are a two-person team and we finished with time to spare.  Afterwards, we spent quite a bit of time talking shop with the owner. She was very personable and didn't make us feel rushed or like she had something better to do. I know I already said it, but the customer service was on point with Puzzling Escape. As much as we love playing rooms, we also love talking with the owners and staff about the experience as well as about escape rooms in general.  We really enjoy hearing about what went into the design and development of their rooms and just learning about how it all started for them. We can't wait for their other rooms to open. Nora's Nightmare is a fun time for anyone looking for something neat to do. Regardless of your level of experience, get out there and play this game.  You'll be glad you did."
