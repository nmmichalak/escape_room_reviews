"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,0,"Took my boyfriend for our anniversary and this was our first time doing an escape room. We chose the Sherlock Holmes theme. We were greeted by the manager, who was super cool. Overall our whole experience was so much fun. Definitely will be back and bringing along some friends and family!"
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,1,Did the Sherlock room and it was amazing. Fun time trying to solve all the puzzles. Super tough room with fun twists throughout. This is my 3rd Escape the room and these puzzles were harder than the other 3. The staff was very friendly and patient with us. That's even with us coming at 10am in the morning.
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,2,"Although we didn't solve the mystery of who had Sherlock and where he was, the four of us had a great time. We will definitely be back. It was so much fun!"
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,3,Awesome bonding experience with my family. Had no idea what to expect but we worked well together and we beat it!
"Escape room ""221B Baker Street"" by Beat the Room in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/beat-the-room-221b-baker-street,4,"My friends and I decided on a whim to do an escape room one night. When we called to book a room, the staff was very friendly & accommodating. The ambience & decor were great, and the puzzles were creative yet challenging. We did the 221B room and enjoyed the twist (solving a crime instead of actually escaping the room) I would highly recommend coming here!"
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,0,This was my first experience with an escape room. We attempted the Bad Medicine room. We only got about 60% through before the clock ran out. We had lots of fun trying to figure out all of the clues. This room is very challenging!
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,1,"Every time I come to Tucson, which is often, I do a room (or two!) at Ace of Escape, they are by far my favorite in Tucson. They have a wide variety of rooms, if you catch their Christmas room during the season, it's the best Christmas themed room out there. Very well thought out, not just another room with Christmas decorations. By far my favorite is Bad Medicine, super hard, but I love a challenge! They just opened a new two person room that I can't wait to check out - I've never done a room specifically made for two people. I have a feeling it's harder than it sounds. "
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,2,We had a lot of fun figuring out all of the puzzles and were ecstatic to have escaped the Bad Medicine room!! We can't wait to come back and escape again
"Escape room ""Bad Medicine"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-bad-medicine,3,"My friends and I decided to try the challenging ""Bad Medicine"" as our first time. We had so much fun and got so close that we booked ""The Illusionist"" right after going back to back. We managed to escape that room! We had a blast! Definitely will be back"
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,0,"This is a challenging but enjoyable room. I took my son and a bunch of his friends for his 13th birthday, which happened to be on Friday the 13th. It was just the right amount of spooky and strange to go with the theme of the day. The clues are very challenging but extremely creative and with just a tad bit more time, we probably would have solved it. I'd highly recommend it if you're looking for a challenging, fun, group experience."
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,1,This was the first escape room I've ever attempted but it was so fun! It is a little difficult to find but there is lots of parking. The asylum theme brought the whole room to life. (I got scared not going to lie). And the puzzles were challenging and very well thought out. I had a great experience.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,2,We had a great time at TrapZone. There were lots of good puzzles and they weren't repetitive. Most of the puzzles worked well for a group so everyone got involved. Overall a very well designed room.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,3,It was super challenging and fun. A great interactive set up! Better to go with 4-5 people than with a large group if you really want to escape.
"Escape room ""The Asylum"" by TrapZone Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/trapzone-escape-rooms-the-asylum,4,"Our whole dental team escaped the asylum with just minutes to spare! We had so much fun and enjoyed the group challenge. Lots of laughs, a few scares, and a lot of brain-busting clues to solve! Can't wait to come back again. Highly recommended for fun and for groups!"
"Escape room ""Are We Dead? VR"" by Virtual Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virtual-room-los-angeles-are-we-dead,0,This is awesome! Like nothing we have ever done or tried before!
"Escape room ""Are We Dead? VR"" by Virtual Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/virtual-room-los-angeles-are-we-dead,1,"Just played the new Are We Dead game at Virtual Room. It was great! I've played all 3 games at this company and its newest game has polished the interface and introduced a cheeky sense of humor and a cute game mechanic. Our game hosts were fantastic as well, providing appropriate hints to keep the pace of the game fun. We had a wonderful time, thanks!"
"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,0,My first escape room and it was an amazing time! Fun and challenging! it took us 59 minutes to escape Alcatraz! I recommend this escape room to all locals and travelers!
"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,1,This was the best escape room I've done!  It's pretty challenging but solvable.  We learned at the end that there are a few ways to solve some of the puzzles which was really cool.  I did this escape room with a group of friends and we had a blast and really enjoyed our night.
"Escape room ""Alcatraz: The Breakout"" by Merlin Entertainments in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/merlin-entertainments-alcatraz-the-breakout,2,"Without giving too much away, this was a very fun escape room with a great theme, but my group left a little disappointed because the last puzzle was too difficult, and required us to get several hints. We had quickly figured out WHAT we had to do, but it was so difficult, I almost believed that it wasn't the right thing to do. I've done many escape rooms, and usually the difficult part is figuring out WHAT the puzzle is, not solving the puzzle. But in general, I really liked many of the puzzles, and especially the theme."
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,0,"Great way to celebrate,  any occasion!Can't wait for the next girls night out!Have a creepy fun time trying to escape from THE ATTIC!"
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,1,"I had never done an escape room before this one, and I must say it was an excellent first experience. Two other friends and I tackled the Attic room and made it out alive just in the nick of time. One of my friends has done multiple escape rooms before so it was definitely a benefit to have someone on the team with their head in the game. The room was super creepy and dark (very on theme) and the clues were challenging but rewarding to solve. The room was extremely well decorated and believable, I felt like a part of the story and that our mission was real, but it was quite small. I think our group of three was the perfect size. We'd bump into each other sometimes with the limited space, but there were enough puzzles that all of us were working on something different at the same time. The staff were also super friendly and helpful, commending us for finishing such a challenging room. I highly recommend this place and I'm looking forward to going back to finish them all!"
"Escape room ""Attic"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-attic,2,"Came here for a friend's birthday and did The Attic, so fun! We were a group of 4 and did not escape. I would recommend this for a group of friends looking to do somthing a little different. Will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-asylum,0,"Had an absolute blast! We were soooo close to escaping ""Asylum"" but didn't quite make it. One of the most fun things I've ever done!! Can't wait to go back!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-asylum,1,"My friends and I adventured through The Asylum! It was creepy, challenging, and probably one of the coolest team building exercises a person could go through. Samuel was very humorous and helpful on getting us started, his personality definitely kept us in better spirits on finishing the room! I will certainly be coming back to challenge another room soon!!"
"Escape room ""Asylum"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-asylum,2,Was our first night to go last night. Didn't pass the Asylum escape room but had tons of fun trying. The guy at the front was absolutely funny and made our visit the best! Can't wait to try the others as well!
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,0,"Dynamic Escape Rooms has come up with a great game idea. An escape room with varying degrees of challenges. You can chose medium, hard, or extreme depending on how experienced or brave you are! And apparently even if you chose one style one time, when you come back to do another style, you don't play it the same way, so it's almost like a completely different room. We chose the medium Deja Vu and it was just right for us. You don't have to be a Doctor Who fan to do this room. It just adds to the fun and the geekiness if you are. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this room. The decor is great and It was a very fun experience. Our gamemasters were Ignacio and Adam. Ignacio knew exactly when to give nudges and hints, making him one of the best gamemasters we have ever had. (Thx, Ignacio!) Also, Adam is one of the best front lobby people. He is also available on the website for a chat if you have questions. (Thx, Adam!) If you want to play a private room, you don't need to ""buy out"" the rest of the spots. You only pay $30 extra to make it yours alone! The lobby and restrooms were clean and uncluttered. This room would appeal to all ages, sci-fi fans, Doctor Who fans, puzzle fans, game fans. In other words, if you like escape games, we recommend this business to anybody and everybody, travelers and locals alike!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,1,"This was my first ‘escape room’ experience and the team at Dynamic Escape Rooms have set the bar very high. Initially I wasn’t thrilled with the idea of being locked in a room and forced to escape, but was immediately comforted by the amazing staff that assured me that this wasn’t the typical escape room. I could leave and take a break as needed, the door wasn’t locked, and to think of it as an interactive experience instead. And it was just that. I was amazed at the complexity and range of the puzzles in the room and the imaginative story line that linked the entire experience together. I first played at the medium level of the Time Machine Game, my team and I barely completed it on time, but felt we could definitely complete the hard level now that we were familiar with the layout. We couldn’t have been more wrong. I was amazed at how much more complex and different the puzzles had become with a change in levels, needles to say we did not complete the level on time. I will definitely be back and will be recommending Dynamic Escape Rooms to all of my friends. Great Job Dynamic!!!"
"Escape room ""The Time Machine: Deja Vu"" by Dynamic Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/dynamic-escape-rooms-deja-vu,2,"WOW! What an amazing experience! I have been waiting for so long for a great escape room experience. I have been to escape rooms in Las Vegas, Palm Springs and Phoenix, none compared to Dynamic. The staff is professional, courteous and helpful. The room can be set at different levels, I can't wait to go back and try a harder level! I definitely recommend checking out Dynamic Escape Rooms to all looking for a fun and immersive challenge! Great job Dynamic Escape Rooms staff and creators can't wait to go back!"

"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,0,Already played 3 games and loved every game so far! We played Museum Heist tonight and our game master Brady was awesome!! Thank you for making this a great birthday and we can't wait to come play Mystery Mansion!
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,1,"We took part in the Museum Heist game. 2 adults and 2 15 yr old boys. This was the most fun we've had in a while. You are locked in a room with clues that you have to figure out in an hour in order to escape the room and get the picture to prove you got out in time. The clues are some common sense, some general math and problem-solving. We visited 2 other game rooms with other companies and this one is by far the best. I am so glad they opened up in Montgomery. They are also located in a great side of town!!"
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,2,"I went here with my family. We were a group of 8 ranging from ages 7 to 66 (grandchildren, children, and parents) and everyone had a great time. We did the museum heist room and we barely got out in time. This place is clean, the staff is friendly, and one hour goes by really fast. Everyone is our group was able to participate and were genuinely excited and happy when we left."
"Escape room ""Museum Heist"" by Breakout Games - Montgomery in Montgomery",https://worldofescapes.com/montgomery/quests/breakout-montgomery-museum-heist,3,"We played the museum heist on Saturday 5-21, had an absolute BLAST!!! We've been to other gaming places similar to Breakout Montgomery and I must say this one is the best by far!!! Thanks to the owners & staff for making it awesome."
"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,0,"Fyi to set expectations, my friends and I have done several dozen escape rooms. Not sure experts but not new to the scene either. We loved the puzzles. They were refreshing compared to some of the overused ones we've seen. They did an EXCELLENT job with the startup tech theme. Lots of jokes that techies are sure to love. But if you're not from the startup world, you'll still be able to enjoy the puzzles and story without feeling lost. Great for group sizes 5-8. The first few puzzles are a little linear to get everyone warmed up, but the following ones can be parallelized so everyone's working on something and not feeling bottlenecked. Definitely would recommend!"
"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,1,Silicon Valley's Startup Escape room is a love letter to the Product Hunt generation
"Escape room ""Startup Escape"" by Startup Escape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/startup-escape,2,"With such a market saturation of Escape Rooms, it was really refreshing to find one that cultivates such innovation. The concept of launching your startup and a set amount of money is such a nice change of pace from the generic murder or end of world scenarios that seem to dominate the landscape. Thought this balanced difficulty and entertainment extremely well, and look forward to seeing more from the creator down the road!"
"Escape room ""Big Top Circus"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-big-top-circus,0,"My boyfriend and I are escape room enthusiasts and North Valley Escape Room continues to surpass our expectations with every new room they open! We have done all of their rooms, most recently doing their Big Top Circus. Their circus room is amazing! Seriously, I cannot say enough good things about this room. It is now in my top five favorite rooms (we've done 121 total so far to give you a comparison). It is very aesthetically-pleasing and the puzzles are very clever, well-themed and challenging. All of their other rooms are very well done, too. One thing that sets North Valley apart from some other local escape room places is their employees. They are personable, fun, helpful and have a genuine passion for escape rooms and talking to others that do as well. Their clue system is very fluent and doesn't lead you in the wrong direction and they are quick to deliver them when needed. We love North Valley and can't wait for their next room to open because they never disappoint. There is a lot of heart that goes into their rooms and it definitely shows. Keep up the great work and keep wowing us with whatever comes next."
"Escape room ""Big Top Circus"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-big-top-circus,1,"We did ZZ's Big Top Circus but failed and probably needed a few more minutes. It was really thought out and well done and lots of riddles, puzzles and locks, but it was linear so we couldn't work on different puzzles/riddles individually. We had to ask for quite a few clues since some of them were a bit difficult. There were multiple rooms and it was fun seeing each themed room. I can't wait to try The Great Outdoors next time!"
"Escape room ""Big Top Circus"" by North Valley Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/north-valley-escape-room-big-top-circus,2,"This place is absolutely top-notch when it comes to escape rooms. We've done and made it out of three of the rooms (Big Top Circus, The Great Outdoors, and Alcatraz). We even did two in one day because we couldn't get enough! I've been through a few other rooms, and NVER really knows how to serve up an immersive, detailed experience for all involved. We'll definitely be returning to try all of the other rooms!"

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/prison-la,6,RoomEscape is the industry standard of what escape rooms should aspire to be. Very clean cut puzzles with great implementations of technology. I have done all 4 of their rooms and each has a well thought out combination of puzzles to make their games interesting for a variety of group sizes. Their themes are excellent choices and provide a new experience with each room. Would highly recommend.

"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,0,"We tried the game titled ""The Lost Expedition"" which was rated medium-hard as far as it's level of difficulty. Without giving anything away, we'll say that it's a lot different than what you're used to, and has a lot of parts to solving which will make your team think outside the box, communicate well, but this particular Escape Room had a particularly good ""flow"" as you progress through the room. We will say that the actual room used for the puzzle, are well thought out, Jason was a great host, and we all agree that this Escape Room is one of our Top 5 favorites we've ever tried. Not because we solved it, but because it was VERY fun to do! Have you ever done an Escape Room where it's a lock defeating puzzle and all you managed to do was open 15+ locks? Well, this Escape Room is far from that, and was really really interesting. Give Steal and Escape a try! We think you'll like their games A LOT! Steal and Escape's experiences cost $32/person, but we also think it was time very well spent in our humble opinion."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,1,"So I actually ran The Lost Expedition as my first escape room ever on December 19, and while I thought I had done a bunch of research ahead of time on how escape rooms work and what to expect, this room subverted my expectations and set up a tough standard for future rooms I would do.Everything in the room is user-activated (really heavy arduino use), and one of the mechanics of the room actually gives the players more agency in their experience. There are no traditional padlocks or number pads. There is a critical path for the players to follow, but non-linear encounters line that path. Certain players have roles defined in the context of the game that provide a natural kick to encourage participation and communication, and I feel like that's really clever and probably doesn't get enough credit.Jason is a great game master and clearly has the experience to know when and how to nudge versus hint, and crafted an experience for our group that felt appropriately challenging, but never frustrating. My first experience with an escape room just happened to be this one, and it was so great that I was motivated to visit a different facility on the same night. The only bummer here is that so much heart and soul has to go into the creation of each room that I don't want to come back too soon, because once I play Mysterious Stranger I'm going to have to wait until the next room is released."
"Escape room ""The Lost Expedition"" by Steal and Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/steal-and-escape-the-lost-expedition,2,"My group and I completed The Lost Expedition and HIGHLY recommend this company and room! For my birthday my group and I decided to do an escape room crawl in San Diego and this was our first stop. Not only is this room very immersive, the staff is also extremely nice.We originally were supposed to have four people playing this room, but plans changed and could only do it with three. Instead of turning us away and saying that we couldn't do the room, the two gentlemen working just came in at one point to help us with the one puzzle that required four people. Without giving too much away, the room begins with everyone being assigned a role that will help you in completing the room. I really liked this idea because it ensures that everyone gets to be involved in the room, instead of just have a few players steamroll everyone else. The team elements that are required to escape really add to the experience in my opinion.The other major difference with this room is that it isn't your traditional 60 minute room. It's all dependent on the choices you make throughout the game how long it will last. Your time could end in 20 minutes, or it can end in two hours. We will definitely be back next time we're in San Diego to do their other room, and can't wait to see what this company has in store for the future!"

By far the best escape room I've done so far. The owner was super nice and friendly. We trusted other reviews for this specific place and it was fun. The decor was excellent and all the features worked, nothing was broken or not working as it should. We were able to really get lost in the game and dice into it. Definitely recommend this place and the Alice room"
"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,1,We booked our Escape Room experience this afternoon; we chose Alice's Dream. We had so much fun! I love the setup in each room - super cute! Totally Alice in Wonderland theme. We find the puzzles & riddles challenging. You don't have to know anything about Alice in Wonderland to solve the puzzles. Christina was super nice & friendly;she gave us clues to help us move along & not get stuck.  She said she does not penalize us if we ask for help; what matters is we have fun. We would come back here again & try out other escape rooms. And their restrooms are super clean which is important to me & what I always like in a business.
"Escape room ""Alice's Dream"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-alices-dream,2,I brought my family here for my parents' and little sister's first time doing an escape room and we all had an incredible time! I was always worried my parents might get frustrated or not really understand what's going on but Alice's Dream is really family friendly and great for all levels. Barry and his wife did such an amazing job into the production of the escape room - it really felt like we were in Alice's dream from Alice in Wonderland! I will say that nothing is actually frightening but I did scream multiple times when things would open up but that's just me being me LOL I would 100% recommend this place to everyone!

No tedious task ""puzzles"" that can waste time. Outcome: We didn't make it but came close by being in the home stretch of the last set of challengesTime: Visited during soft opening several weeks ago; owner was extremely open and honest with us about the additional challenges that this may entail but it did not take away from the wonderful experience in the least. Should only get even better and better.Team: 4 - 2 adults and 2 teens - we've done 6 escapes rooms previouslyDifficulty: This was a challenging room for us but not impossible; This would be very challenging to first timers."

Adults and kids all had fun, including grandma and grandpa!  Its pretty much a sci fi first person shooter, with team play... Two players are equipped with power shields that can block attacks and also be thrown like a boomerang, and laser pistols. The other 4 players carry laser rifles that also have a flamethrower... Theme is alien invasion... If your teammate gets damaged too much they shut down and you have to tap their shoulder to heal them and they can rejoin the battle.  If alien eggs are allowed to spawn they may jump on you and start biting your chest and your teammate needs to shoot them to get them off, but you can kick the eggs to break them or hit them with the flame throwers... A fun team tactic: give the kids the shield to block, and adult stands behind them with a rifle to shoot overtop of the shield! :)"

He had a great time. We did Amber Sky and my son loved the experience. I would say this is bit pricy. I could have taken kids to Great America all day for the same price. This was a 30 minute long game so I hope they would lower the price to attract more people.

I've done plenty of escapes rooms and immersive experiences over the last couple years, The Fortune Teller Room was definitely a breath of fresh air. I don't want to spoil too much, but the room was unique in terms of how puzzles and challenges are presented. Everyone had an opportunity to participate. The theme and story of room were spot on and immersive. No random items that feel out of place like directional locks or number locks. There room is challenging in a fun and clever way. If you have done escape rooms before, definitely check this one out with your escape group for a different type of escape room experience."

Mistress Nova welcomed us from behind her velvet to get our tarot card reading.  The signs aren't good.  A mystery with dire consequences is a foot.""What is in store is a fun, creepy, camp experience that was exceptionally executed in production with fun lighting, a playful background music, and delightful acting. The games were a lot of mini puzzles with a timed element like any good escape room but broken up with interaction with Mistress Nova to further the story.  The immersive aspect of the room was really amped up having to talk to our fortune teller.If you've been here before, you'll know that this is the same space that was used as the Disrupted Decades room but they've done a phenomenal job making the room its own experience that I couldn't tell at all what the room was before.Great job Level Games team!"

The fortune teller herself is more of a mediator than a medium. She will guide you through the narrative and provide some hints along the way.The room has great atmosphere. It is like an old penny arcade that has a variety of delightful challenges requiring problem and puzzle solving, dexterity, and creativity. Teamwork was encouraged and rewarded by our live Zoltar.We had a group of 3 and found that there was plenty for each person to do. They recommend 4 people for this max of 5 room. As the cards are dealt, the game design definitely benefits a group of 4.I can see great success for this room and continued success for Level Games in the future. The care and enthusiasm in the creation of this room is truly evident and incorporates all aspects that make an immersive/escape experience unforgettable."

"Escape room ""Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-mystery-at-the-lost-pointe-lodge,2,"We did the Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge room and rented it out just for our group. The room itself was decorated very nicely and we definitely felt instantly immersed in the story provided -- it has a maximum of six people so it's definitely the perfect size for a private room. The gentleman that greeted us and gave us the story, and took us into the room was great as well! We did have a hiccup with the game master with 8 minutes left on the clock. However, the company reached out to us the following day to apologize -- they were training new staff and things just got a little out of order for a moment. We've since returned and attempted The Secrets of the Master. Our faith was definitely restored in them due to their quick and understanding customer service, as well as our great second experience!Regardless of the hiccup, the Mystery at the Lost Pointe Lodge was actually our favorite room out of the two. If you're a group that's looking for a creepy room that isn't necessarily scary, it's perfect. The puzzles for both rooms are very well put together and as newbie players we didn't stand a chance to escape without clues!"

This was my first room at this company and it did not disappoint! I went with a group of 6 and I felt like you can definitely do this room with a smaller group because it was a little tight for 6. This is a good room for beginners because the puzzles were not overly difficult. The production value of this room was phenomenal, as this is not your average keys and locks type of escape room. If you're looking for a beginner friendly escape room with high production value, then this is the room for you. "

However, despite my failure I have to rate this 5/5 because it was phenomenal. This is the hardest room they have and by FAR the hardest room I've ever done. I truly felt that I lost this room fairly and squarely (and I don't say this often lol). Before starting this room, you have a choice of picking it in difficult mode and of course being with fellow avid players, they chose the HARDEST MODE. That was our first mistake. I probably wouldn't pick the hard mode unless you had at least 5 people all of whom have done 20-30+ rooms. This was a true v4 room with little to no keys/locks. Lots of puzzles to solve and definitely a lot of puzzles that I have NEVER SEEN and was WOW'd once clue master explained it to us. This room put lots of different skills to the test and made us quickly realize our weaknesses. I highly recommend this room!"

Very well done, no red herrings, and an appropriate amount of encouragement from the Game Master (Dillion).  The puzzles were great and plentiful.  The room was very professional and functioned as designed.  There were no cheesy puzzles or tricks that were stupid, as sometimes happen.  Just a Grade-A experience.  And no, we didn't solve it by the time limit, but they let us continue, and we got out about 10 minutes later.  The first escape room we didn't complete, but probably still the most fun and most challenging.  Also, the room was well-lite, so you can see without straining.  I've been in escape rooms where you can't read the combination locks because it was so dark...very frustrating...but that didn't happen here. You will not be disappointed.  Highly recommended.  A word of caution...don't leave anything in your vehicle while you do the escape room.  Our van was broken into and we lost some stuff.  It was our fault, we had been told earlier in the week in San Francisco not to leave anything visible in your vehicle, or they will smash and grab...and it happened to us.  Live and learn.  Good luck!"

Located in the old Exploratorium building at the Palace of Fine Arts, where currently housed is the wonderful Innovation Hangar exhibition of old Panama-Pacific International Expo historic items, you'll find the Palace Games' Great Houdini Escape Room. This is the same room that Houdini presented to his notable friends 100 years prior. With a team of friends, you'll use your wits and teamworking skills to solve your way out of the room. It's challenging and very, very fun. Not sure when the Houdini room ends, but from what they've told us, we can expect a spy-themed room coming in the future.Highly recommended!"

The puzzles were all well thought out and much more creative than the standard combo-lock puzzles I've seen in the other rooms. The puzzles are challenging, but all of them made sense and there no crazy leaps that you had to make to solve it. The room itself is well put together with an underlying theme that pulls everything together and enhances the experience. The only downside of the Houdini Escape Room is that I fear that no other escape room will ever live up to this new standard.I definitely recommend the Houdini Escape Room as it is not only extremely fun and challenging, it is also the best escape room out there."

I have been here twice, once for the Houdini Room and once for the Roosevelt Room. Both times were fun, but I preferred the Roosevelt Room slightly more than the Houdini Room. I might also add that we escaped both times! We didn't need any hints in the Roosevelt Room and we still managed to escape in 72 minutes. One thing that was exceptional about our run in the Roosevelt Room was our host, Alan. He was funny and very helpful. If you are into escape rooms, I would definitely check out Palace Games.

The detail and sophiscation of the room is ridiculous! I would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you don't fancy yourself a puzzle person (I'm not!) there is something for everyone."
"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,0,"After doing 50+ rooms, this is one of my all-time favorite rooms. Unique puzzles that fit the themes nicely. The cleanest design I have ever seen and was esthetically beautiful. A mix of modern and traditional elements. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and very accommodating with the booking process. I am usually not a fan of walkie-talkies for hints. However, the walkie-talkies used were simple, worked well, and hints were given quickly demonstrating that the game master was tracking our progress carefully. Lock Down delivers a solid A+ escape room experience which can be a rare find these days."

"Escape room ""Samurai"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-samurai,4,"There are a wealth of great room escape options in the East Valley and Lockdown rates among or at the top of the list.  Our team completed the Theft and Samurai rooms and were thoroughly impressed by each of them.  The puzzles are clever, engaging, and challenging.  Better yet, they truly feel as if they are organic and belong in their environments.  What sets Lockdown apart from other escape rooms is their commitment and attention to a particular aesthetic.  They have realized that challenge does not have to detract from the overall immersion of a room escape experience.  Their design principles are a welcome change from the many rooms where escaping the zombie apocalypse, a fallout shelter, or an alien research facility requires the unlocking of a half dozen bike locks.Lockdown is a challenging, affordable, and engaging option for a group room escape.  Their staff is friendly, enthusiastic, and welcoming.  We will surely be back to enjoy their other experiences."

"Escape room ""Red Alert"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-red-alert,1,"We had an awesome time in the Red Alert room at this location. Initially we were supposed to play Da Vinci, but when we arrived the game masters warned us that it has about a 10% escape rate. Wish we would have known that before we booked! (The website just lists it as ""hard"" so we had no idea). We were nervous since we've done a couple dozen rooms but didn't feel like we were ""experts"" in any sense, so game master Jess suggested we play Red Alert instead and we were so glad she did. The room was a perfect mix of physical puzzles, lock and key, and technology, and we never felt stressed or stuck. Jess was awesome with giving the right amount of hint without just telling you how to solve the puzzle, and we escaped with a few minutes to spare. We also talked to her for a while afterwards and got some recommendations for more 60out rooms to play. Can't wait to try them out next time I'm in LA!!"

"Escape room ""Island Escape"" by Breakout Games - Mobile in Mobile",https://worldofescapes.com/mobile/quests/breakout-mobile-island-escape,2,"We went to the Island Escape room. They had a really fun theme and room design and a lot of new and novel puzzles that were well engineered. The staff was friendly, engaging and on top of monitoring our progress. The communication was clear and easy to understand.Cons:Some of the puzzles were huge leaps of logic. One of the first ones took us about 15 minutes to figure out and we had to use one of our three clues. A few tweaks on it would have made it much more understandable. After we won, the room leader came in and told us that a lot of people get caught up on it. If that's the case, then it's probably the puzzle that needs fixing. I don't like the feeling of being stuck on the first puzzle! I wish they had given me a few more wins before a big stall.This experience puts this room at the middle of the pack of my escape room experiences, but I do hope they continue to refine the puzzles because the room could be great!"

I've done a few other rooms, but nothing like this one. We put on our pith helmets and escaped the space ship into the tomb only to discover we had to keep going back into the space ship. All of the rooms work together, and you have to split your group into small teams and work on the puzzles, and just keep building on puzzles until the very end. We were overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere created by this room. It was incredible with Hollywood style special effects, but I don't want to give too much away. You feel like you're in a tomb!! After we escaped, we had to all hang around and check out the technology in this room. It's mind-blowing to see how this whole thing works together.

The owner was very nice and took time after we were done to talk about where we went wrong, what recommendations we had for him, etc. Great customer service. We will definitely be back!"

I like that escape rooms are such a great bonding activity that allow us to think together through and talk about what happened after over dinner.

We did the room where we had to find the sword.  That room was challenging but fun!  Our group loved it.  We were sooooooo close, that we even got bonus time!  Sadly, we still didn't get out.

At the end of the room, the theme definitely came full circle so I appreciated the attention to the detail and I would highly recommend this to anyone.However, it doesn't beat my favorite room of all time which is the Great Houdini Escape Room which is actually in San Francisco, so if you're ever in SF you definitely need to go there!"

Comeon, I pay that much and more for shorter sixty minute games.Overall I give it five stars across the board, quality of puzzles, difficulty level, theming, quality of the props and decorations.  And the briefing they give is spot on, the lore of their backstory is so cool, mostly because it has a lot to do with actual history.  Of course I love time travel to start with, but Escapeopolis actually pulls it off and makes it seem authentic."

This is a hidden, and soon to be a not so hidden treasure in NWA!!  My husband and I and another couple tried out Escapeopolis and Basinga! we found our new favorite escape room game!!First, the puzzles are phenomenal, all very crafty and unique - especially compared to other escape rooms that seem to depend on way too many padlocks.  My hubby loved it!!!  You really gotta think, you know, use the old brain pan to figure these puzzles out.And the look and feel of this place is awesome!  From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were thrown back in time to some military laboratory where top secret stuff went on.  The look and feel continued from the front door into the game and all the way out the door!!  Very nice.We played their newest escape room, the insurgent attack, where we were sent on a mission as security agents to 1969 to... oops no spoilers here folks - lol!We didn't win initially, but we played again later in the day when they had another time for us to book and killed it.Don't forget to book early for this one, they were pretty busy when we went.

It was their first game ever, and I’m afraid we completely spoiled them! This game was by far the best game we ever played! The level of immersion from the time we walked in to the time we escaped the room was the best we’d ever seen! Plus, the way the puzzles were set up made sense, like we were in a real place and not a game!

So here’s my review for that room as well.The insurgent attack was nothing like the 1959 game, but boy, was it cool! The story is kicked up a notch and the special effects are super cool too! The game is also 90 minutes, unlike the 60 minute 1959 room. The puzzle were harder than the 1959 room, but they’re still solveable, thanks to the extra 30 minutes. My friends and I didn’t escape, but we’ll definitely be back next weekend to beat this game too! We found our newest favorite escape room today!"

The story of the game was not only in the game, but also through the rest of the building as well!Once we were in the game, we had to change our normal strategy since there was only one padlock in the entire room! Crazy, I know!We escaped with just seconds left on the clock, but, boy, was it ever so exciting!Definitely give this room a try! My friends and I had such a good time, that we immediately booked the newest room, the insurgent attack, for after lunch!"
"Escape room ""1959 - Jack's Place"" by The Escapeopolis Project in Fayetteville (AR)",https://worldofescapes.com/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,7,Unfortunately this was the absolute worst escape room I have ever done. Which is unfortunate because the couple that run it obviously put a lot of time into it. My wife and I have done 20+ escape rooms in several different states across the country and this one was BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE and BY FAR THE WORST! We brought 2 friends that had never done an escape room and I am so sorry that was their first experience. We paid $140 to do their newest room having something to do with time travel. Sadly after having spent over 2 and a half hours there total I still can't even properly explain the room. He talked FOREVER before we even were allowed in. Even though I had asked repeatedly to go to the bathroom. Then serval of there props didn't work. The flashlight we needed to get into the second room wouldn't turn on. The intro video was excessively long. They entire thing was WAY TO COMPLICATED! The clues he gives you aren't even real clues and they were off center so we couldn't even see all of it on the screen. I was so upset with how ridiculous everything was that we told him we were done even before our time ran out. We just wanted to go home. He offered to let us come back for free to do this room again since so much of equipment didnt work correctly but he should have offered us half our money back. I will NEVER go back and I will be sure that none of my friends go either. If you want a fantastic escape room experience go to Bolt NWA! The only reason we tried escapeopolis is because we had done all the other escape rooms in NWA.

Not only did the rooms have very creative and intricate puzzles, but even the lobby matched the aesthetic of the adventure at hand. Additionally, the rules, instead of being blandly stated, were presented in the context of the backstory. These smaller, more subtle details really helped create an enjoyable experience."

At a normal escape room you are greeted at the door and led to the room where you solve various puzzles to escape. Escapeopolis is much different than a normal escape room. From the moment you are greeted at the door you feel like you are already immersed in an elaborate storyline. You are led to a room full of intricate details and thought provoking challenges, which truly test your puzzle solving capabilities. I encourage anyone who wants an enjoyable mental challenge to visit escapeopolis!"

They even decorated the room by writing Happy 300th on their wall. For the room itself, we did The Menagerie. When I tell you that we had a blast, it doesn't even begin to describe it. The room was so well designed and there were lots of things to do for the 8 people in the room. I usually don't like larger groups in general for a room but this was a special occasion and it did NOT disappoint for one minute. We were thoroughly entertained throughout its entirety. I can't wait to see what else Level Games has in store because this room was great! Thank you again for the amazing hospitality!"
"Escape room ""The Menagerie"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-menagerie,1,"Played ""The Menagerie"" when it FIRST opened expecting a clunky ""beta"" but were pleasantly surprised at how complete and solid it was. Out the gate, this game was amazing. You can tell these people put their heart and souls into these games because of the attention to detail. My girlfriend is such a scaredy-cat and screamed multiple times at inanimate stationary object, which made it that much more exciting. We also played the Doggy Dog and Disrupted Decades rooms in the past and left with big smiles. All REALLY well done and super fun. Will be back if they release new stuff."
"Escape room ""The Menagerie"" by Level Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapades-la-the-menagerie,2,"Escaped from the new Menagerie Room at Level Games. It is a great experience developed by the creative minds and hands of the designers and owners of Arcane and Escape Chronicles.  All the puzzles and set pieces demonstrate the skilled craftsmanship of Arcane's wooden and mechanical wonders coupled with the originality and innovative puzzle flow that is a hallmark of Escape Chronicles.  This room was more of a cabinet of curiosities than a menagerie, with beautiful and intricate showcases that are interesting to look at and challenging to fully comprehend. There are some thrilling and unsettling moments provided by good production, sound and light effects, and most importantly a sense of timing and pacing that a certain evil genius would be proud of.  This room is a must-do!"

Most, if not all, puzzles are unique in their origin and execution. For first timers or enthusiasts looking for a fun, silly theme, play LIT. For those looking for a small-group challenge, play Inventor's Secret. Larger groups will want to play Burned Out. I particularly enjoyed the mini-escape room that they offered in their lobby. This was only the second instance of that idea that I've found in Arizona and I wish more locations offered it as an intro and lobby time-killer."

"Escape room ""The Abyss"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-the-abyss,0,"Abyss is so much fun! It's very tech related and the puzzles aren't like the other puzzles in other rooms. You have to really think what you would have to do in that situation. Also, the simulations are really cool. You feel that you are truly going under water, because the capsule moves slightly to give you that feel. If you are very claustrophobic I'd advise against this room, as the space is kind of small. Not extremely small, spacious enough for 2 people to move around, but not a lot. Very fun maze room. Highly recommend."

"Escape room ""The Abyss"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-the-abyss,2,"I attempted this room with my boyfriend recently when we found out that this opened because we had been wanting to do a room with just us 2 to see how much better we have gotten at escape rooms. This room was immersive, but that's every maze room escape room. It was pretty linear, considering how the room was only designed for 2 people to play. The only issue I had with this room was that there were a few technical issues with the room, such as things opening when they shouldn't, and other parts not working properly. I imagine they probably fixed it now, but those were some issues we had when we were playing this room. We still managed to escape with a few minutes to spare, although I imagine we would have escaped much quicker if we didn't have all those technical difficulties that threw us off. "

This is strictly puzzles and solving riddles. Party in Vegas was so much FUN!!! It was a nice pace of change compared to other serious rooms. The decor was great and highly immersive. But I would say it's one of the easier escape rooms. We only had three people and escaped in 53 mins.

"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,2,Escaped the Theft room with my family on 5-14-17 (with 3 seconds to spare).

"Escape room ""The Theft"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-the-theft,5,We had a great time doing the Thief room but got stuck a few times. We did end up figuring it out in the end and beating the time but only with a lot of help. Overall it was a great experience but the North Valley Escape Room in Anthem is so far the best we've been too.

The manager, Marian, who was also our gamemaster, was super nice and welcoming. We did the Pipe Works, which turned out to be a good, solid escape room. This room could be divided into 2 teams racing against each other, or as we did it, one team. This was a fun room, run by a fun staff. Marian was a great gamemaster, and she knew exactly when we needed nudges and help. (Thx, Marian!) We highly recommend this location to beginners and experienced gamers alike."

The rooms have great production quality, a wide variety of clues, and are interactive so the whole group can participate and enjoy. The theming is great and the staff is friendly and helpful. The zombie room was harder than the bunker, so I'd suggest starting with the bunker or asking the staff which room to book if you haven't played before. They're very helpful and will help you find a room that's a good fit for your group."

We were able to escape but the puzzles were definitely challenging and keep you on your toes.The tech in this room was fantastic and seamless, anytime something would be completed or unlocked the transitions were seamless and very well designed.Our game master, Anthony, did a fantastic job setting the stage and environment for the room.

I tried the Mafia Heist room months ago, and had a blast. However, today I had the pleasure to help beta test the new Curse of the Black Knight room, and it exceeded every expectation I had.

"Escape room ""Arcade"" by Escape Era in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-era-arcade,1,This was a really fun escape room once we were there. The puzzles were great and creative and it was good for a big group. May not be ideal for someone with mobility challenges. Very fun time all the kids loved it. The booking was complicated as no one could really answer questions. I booked for a teen party. Things weren't transmitted from the booking to the facility. A little frustrating but the puzzles were great.
"Escape room ""Arcade"" by Escape Era in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escape-era-arcade,2,"Came to this place after searching which had the highest ratings around town and I'm so glad I came to this place! I came here with 5 of my friends for some fun, and boy did we find it. The building is quietly tucked away in Sorrento Valley and pretty easy to get to. Upon arrival, we were very happily greeted by Zoe and her partner in crime. They gave us the full disclosure and all of the info we needed to fully enter the room we were going to escape from. We had an hour like most folks and that was just enough time for the 6 of us to find our way through the various puzzles (with several hints from the awesome duo up front). Highly recommend the arcade room while they still have it!"

"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,2,"Very rarely do I leave reviews for places, but my experience here last weekend absolutely justifies one. I had a chance to try to escape the Cold War Bunker, and quite simply it was one of the most fun things I have ever done. The staff are incredibly friendly, the rooms are built and themed like mini soundstages, and the puzzles are genuinely difficult, but not impossible. It all adds to an awesome hour of puzzle solving and team building. I paid $33 to spend an hour frustrated and failing, and I can't wait to go back for more. If you derive any sort of joy from problem solving and working a riddle over and over until you finally solve it, you NEED to check this place out.RoomEscape LA, I will be back."
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,3,"My group did both rooms, and BOTH are so perfect. The exact level of difficulty and ingenuity that you want in an escape room.We liked the bunker more -- escaped with ten minutes to go. It was impeccably decorated and had a good mix of logic and physical challenges. The bank was also so fun -- the flashlights were a good touch, and this room had a great multi-section layout. Escaped with ZERO seconds left on the clock!! Challenging but not undoable!"
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,4,"I've never tried anything like this. I'm not the least bit into video games but this was one of the coolest experience I've had in recent weeks. Just go with an open mind and be ready to think. My team did the cold war bunker. Allegedly, that's the easier of the two rooms, but we certainly found it challenging! One hour went by way too fast! The cool thing about doing this, is that for one hour you are completely immersed in what's going on around you. No phone or outside distraction competing for your attention. I thought of nothing but the task at hand the entire time we were locked in there and it was a very nice change of pace. The crew there is fabulous! Jo is so sweet and gave a nice little pep talk before you enter the bunker. Listen to what she says - she gives a few helpful hints that you're likely to forget once the action starts. I had a slight problem signing up online but she was more than helpful and took care of everything right away. Looking forward to going back and trying the bank vault!"
"Escape room ""Cold War Bunker"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/coldwar-bunker-la,5,"I've watched a lot of James Bond movies, and I've always asked myself ""I wonder if I can do what he does"" - Now I know I can.I got together with a group of friends and did the Bunker. It was one of the best exhibitions of teamwork I had ever seen. We each had different positions, 1 person was a scribe, another would organize clues and process them, another would focus on the puzzles, one person was the leader making executive decisions, another person was constantly scouting the room for things others missed or things that changed in the room etc. We all had a lot of fun, and each person contributed something that helped us get to the next level, it wasn't just 1 person solving everything. Believe me when I say, every single position matters. Irene was a great host. (I think that was her name). She had a great sense of humor, and even joked with us when we we're doing something wrong. As the last 10 minutes hit the clock things got intense with the last puzzle. Finally we solved it, and saved the world! You're welcome."

After booking the room, we realized it was also the most difficult, but we decided we were up for the challenge.  The staff here was also great!  Since we were newbies, he spent some time letting us know how it works and then went on to tell us the back story of our game. We were to discover the clues to unlock our door and to save the city from being flooded.  We were allowed 3 hints during our hour game, which we did use.  There were five of us and the game was definitely difficult but we escaped with only minutes to spare.  So much fun and we can't wait to return and try the other rooms!"

We found out some highly interesting information about Arkansas leading up to the room and then began the ""most challenging"" room in the Mansion. There was a LOT to do in the room, and that's about all I can say without giving away too much information. At the end, we didn't quite finish in time but we were allowed to go slightly over the allotted 60 minutes and complete it. I recommend definitely giving this place a try if you want a fun way to work your brain for an hour!"

This was my 36th room I've escaped, and a lot of the puzzles didn't seem super logical. So when you find two components of a puzzle, it's not clear that they go together, let alone how to use them. We were a bit disappointed that the game masters gave us hints that we didn't ask for, but they were just trying to make sure we maintain a good pace in order to escape the room."

We love them; we came here and played The Theater room, which was fun, and a little challenging. We recently came back to do OutBreak, which we knew was the hardest room, but this room is specifically meant as a money grab room, which I have played a few rooms like this, elsewhere; before! What I mean by that is the room is designed so you don't make it out, and they take your $100 bucks that is costed you to book it! There is a difference between challenging and just making it so hard that you spend the whole time on one set of puzzles starting at screens which hurt your eyes! I thought the concept of the room was awesome but the way the room was laid out, game wise was not good at all! This room in my opinion needs to be reworked; I will not becoming back here again, and I will not be doing another escape room in general, for a long time as this room left me with a very bad, and annoyed feeling, of being taken advantage of money wise! I can no longer recommend this place to anyone that I know or that asks me!"

We didn't finish the whole room in time but we only had two steps left before we could've won so I think we did pretty well!! Overall we had a great time & we are excited to do the other two rooms soon!!

This is new to the Chandler Mall (right by BJ's Brewery and where Cold Stone Creamery used to be). Super clean and really nice inside. Our host was super nice too. The staff was very friendly.

It was fun and challenging. It definitely requires everyone working together to get through all the clues. There were four rooms connected, and some were more challenging than others. Although we didn't make it out (just needed like 3 more minutes),  we all had a blast . I'd definitely recommend this, especially if you want to try something different."
"Escape room ""Jigsaw"" by Rooms of No Return in Bakersfield",https://worldofescapes.com/bakersfield/quests/rooms-of-no-return-saw,3," Best escape game I've played in the Bakersfield area. This is a fun multi-room live escape game. It is well decorated. There is more ""stuff"" than you need to solve the puzzles, but it adds to the feel of the room. There is both searching and puzzles.

"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,1,"We did the Camelot room. It was fun and very cleverly done. We ran out of time butt it was our first time. We didn’t realize that some steps had multiple steps. We were trying not to use hints. We finally used one... we got to the last step. I will say that it would have been better to say...10 steps, and spend less than 6 minutes per step. That budgeting would have helped...then, if we got stuck after 4 minutes, then use a hint. So, we want to go back and try that logic next time."
"Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",https://worldofescapes.com/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,2,"We tried the Camelot Room on a recent Friday evening (along with my youngest son’s college roommate). We called and reserved the room in advance.The 2 staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. After paying and signing waivers, we were shown a short video explaining the “Do’s & Dont’s” and how to use the iPad.They have lockers where you store your cell phones (& other items if you choose), as they do not allow phones in the rooms.This escape room does not use interactive game masters that we were used to. Instead, your hints are delivered by scanning QR codes around the room with the iPad. When you use the hints, it deducts from your time. There is also a bell in the room that you can ring at any time to have a game master come in and help if needed.We found the Camelot room to be challenging, but not to the point that it was frustrating. It wasn’t easy, but it also wasn’t so hard that it was unsolvable. The theme, layout, and props were all thought out very well.Without using any hints, we did escape with a couple of minutes to spare. Although I must admit, had it not been for our kids, my wife and I probably would’ve struggled a little more to make it out in time.After you escape, they take a group photo, which they post to their Facebook page.Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely try one of the other rooms next time!The only negative thing I can say (and it’s not that big of a deal) is that their sign and parking area were not very well lit and we actually passed the place when we first drove by."

We did the Mystery Room and didn't escape in time (got out in just over an hour). The host was really attentive (he wasn't in the room, but I guess from the monitors he could tell when we were struggling) and asked if we wanted clues at just the right times. He was super nice and friendly too and is why I give this place five stars instead of the four I would probably give just for the room itself.Storyline and theme was just okay, but it was still an overall good time. Would recommend this for a fun little date, the room is doable by two people."

Not going to spoil this with hints but all I can tell you is everyone needs to work together and also separately so you have adequate time to complete this. Its part physical and the rest mental. Most of the clues are right in front of you so don't sweat it and overthink too much. Think and act like a prisoner ;)"

As you may already know, you get locked in a themed room for an hour and you have to try and escape by overcoming a number of different physical and mental challenges. It's an experience like no other. My entire group had a really great time and we are looking forward to experiencing the Insane Asylum.  They like to have 6 people per session so if your party is less then 6 you may get paired up with people you don't know. They also don't serve food or alcohol so get your drink on before you come."

It really challenges your logic skills and forces you to exercise teamwork - LOVED IT!Parking can get pretty challenging.  Luckily, we reserved a later time slot so parking wasn't bad, but, I would suggest arriving early, to lock up a parking spot.Susie was a great hostess!  My team (Team Adobo) and I only needed ONE hint to escape and Susie was on the other end of the walkie-talkie ready to help us without giving away too much.  Made the experience more satisfying for us to be able to get through it mostly on our own... "

You can play in groups or just one or two, personally I think the sweet spot is four people because there is a time limit.  My wife and I played and got though it just fine and it was fun from start to finish. The host (sorry forgot his name) is awesome, personable, professional and really created a unique and fun time.  The amount of detail and comedy is well thought out and everywhere you look."

Some seriously genius puzzles that fit the theme and made sense to be there, especially in the witch game. Their other game, The Last Supper, was the amazing! I'd consider it a a thriller/horror game. But the unexpected and best part to me was that I have never laughed so much while playing an escape room. Or maybe in the last few months of my life lol. They set up moments to make us laugh, or for us to make ourselves laugh. The actor was great, the story flowed perfectly. As well as continuously throughout, constantly developing to immerse us further and further. Timing of the puzzles allowed us to finish with only a few minutes to spare.

"Escape room ""Last Supper"" by Quest Tavern Escape Room in Pomona",https://worldofescapes.com/pomona/quests/quest-tavern-escape-room-last-supper,4,Hands down the best escape room out there! We did the witch's cauldron a few weeks ago and loved it! We were told another scary room was opening soon so we decided to come back and give it a try! The last supper was the BEST room I've done so far. The actors are amazing and there is the right amount of scare to keep you on the edge of your seat (you'll know what I mean) but not soo much where you can't solve the puzzles. Definitely recommend 100%!!!
"Escape room ""Mystery Manor"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-mystery-manor,0,"We did this room with 4 people (our other team did it with just 2). The theme is Mystery Manor. Half of our team was running late, and they were nice enough to delayed the game for us. The staff was really nice to us. The room is 3 stars, a-ok, but their customer service brought it up another star. The room wasn't really immersive, but it was definitely decorated nicely. I wish it was bigger and more puzzles though. They didn't have any tech puzzles, and more traditional lock and puzzles. I would like to see them change the room to have more hidden tech, but still keep the same theme.Looking forward to do their Virus Zero room next."

"Escape room ""Houdini’s Hideout"" by Architect Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/theme-quest-escape-rooms-houdinis-hideout,0,"Did the Houdini Room (the smallest and most challenging room) and escaped with 1 minute left! It's a fairly low tech room (mostly just spin locks, and keys). The hint system was through walkie talkie and the GM was very attentive and helpful when we were stuck on some of the puzzles. There are no red herrings in this room, which is very useful so that you don't get stuck on something that isn't part of the game. Only negative thing is that there is no countdown in the room so you either have to ask, or just remember the time you started and time yourself on the clock. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We ended up parking outside in the metered parking. I believe it was $1.50 for 1 hour. We will be back for the other 2 rooms."

Even though it's their smallest room, it was super challenging. We are escape room veterans by now and we had to use all of our 3 hints, but we did escape with about 7 minutes to spare. I love that nothing in these rooms feels like a huge leap. Even when you get stuck and get a clue, you immediately go ""Oh! How did I not get that?!"" It's also great that in a small room, they have multiple things you can be solving or working on at once so that everyone is always occupied. And this time we got magic tricks AND we got to play with a dog in the lobby. Seriously, the staff here is the best. Definitely recommend! Can't wait to go back and do Bonnie and Clyde!"

We had a teen and a child with us, and I they had an awesome time too (make sure to check the policy on bringing kids under 15). Everyone was able to be involved and it was a fun time.

We played with a group of six, which seemed about right for the Madame Lumina room-- any more, it may have been a bit too chaotic for me anyway. But with six players, there seemed to be enough to do to keep us busy and keep the excitement building in the room. The game maker/runner did a good job at keeping us moving along and not letting us get stuck in futile searches. Overall great time!"
"Escape room ""Undercooked"" by Square Room Escape in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/square-room-escape-undercooked,0,"Had a great time.  We were a party of 5 and did the Uncooked game.  Person who checked us in explained everything clearly and answered all our questions.  At the end of game she went over how we did and explained some of the puzzles where were stuck on - eye opener!  lol  Everyone enjoyed themselves and would definitely go back and do it again.  Uncooked game was different from other escape room game types which was a nice surprise and change.  Instead of trying to beat the clock to get out of a room, you're fighting the clock to try to make as many recipes/dishes as possible - nice twist.  Good for all ages."

We did the ""Theatre"" game and finished in 38 minutes, which we were told is really excellent. Communication is so important, so I'd recommend getting a group of people you know to fill that particular room -- trying to communicate well with strangers would've been much more challenging. We are looking forward to doing another one soon. Also, our ""stage manager"" (the room's host) helped make the experience fun. She had her poker face on during the game, but during our recap afterwards was personable, energetic, and had been so observant about the details of how we solved the riddles. RECOMMEND!"

"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by Train Escape in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/train-escape-sabotage,3,"My group of 4 absolutely loved Sabotage! It was somewhat linear while also leaving a lot of room for exploration of codes. The theme was awesome being smashed into a train car with everyone. It gave a real sense of urgency without having to do much to affect us mentally. There were enough red herrings to keep us going down a rabbit hole or two without overwhelming us with useless items and meaningless clues. It's so hard to gush about the room without giving away hints, but I'd say you'd be hard pressed to find something to dislike about Sabotage! Go try it!"

My husband and I have done over 20 escape rooms, and we must say that this is our new favorite room. Megan did a great job as our cluemaster. We were lucky enough to do this room on our own which we prefer. (Too many cooks...and all that). This room had all sorts of unique puzzles and lots of good old-fashioned locks. And lots and lots of books, of course. This franchise allows you to take as long as you need to finish the game, which is always appreciated. We can't wait for their new room to open! If you like escape rooms, put this room at the top of your ""must-do"" list. You won't be disappointed."

And the puzzles were challenging and engaging, but not so ridiculous that no sane person could ever conceivably ever reach that end conclusion on their own accord.  Plus, there are a couple of bonus action items in the game that made our group exclaim in delight and surprise!  This was an extremely well thought out room and a completely delightful way to spend an hour.  I will return and I can't wait until they open another room!"

There's only one room right now, but it was so intricate and fun that I know the Cabin In The Woods (the room they're currently developing) is going to be a huge hit.  The Sleuth Box and Escape Zone AZ are probably my favorite two escape businesses I've visited so far, in regards to the atmosphere, the details of the puzzles, and how they're incorporated into the room.  I felt like I was Sherlock Holmes!"
"Escape room ""Awakened"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-awakened,0,"The room was good, but would probably be best for first timers. People who are experienced with escape rooms may find it too easy. The props and atmosphere were great and scary, but there wasn't much of a narrative as you went through. Some of the puzzles were innovative and had some cool technology involved, but the final puzzle was a bit simple and made the ending a little anticlimactic. It took us a moment to realize that we were done! I enjoyed that the room was really big, with a lot of smaller rooms that you progressed to. Overall it was a good rioo"
"Escape room ""Awakened"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-awakened,1,The staff was awesome and very patient!

Glenn was in charge of leading our group. He was very fun and made us comfortable when we were all nervous. The escape room was not challenging here and there. I loved how it was different rooms and ways to get around. I lost my voice from screaming so much but that's me being a wuss.
"Escape room ""Awakened"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-awakened,4,This place easily deserves 5 stars!

"Escape room ""The Lost Jungle Safari"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-the-lost-jungle-safari,1,"For my second escape room experience, I brought three 13 and 14 year old boys that I babysit. The four of us took on the jungle room and we all had a blast solving the clues. We did escape but the boys also took full advantage of the use of the walkie talkie and asking for hints whenever they got stuck for more than a couple of minutes. The hints were helpful, though, and we were able to quickly move on to the next task with a little nudge. I thought that the dim lighting in the jungle room provided an extra challenge as it made things a little more hidden and harder to see. There was a good mixture of easy to more difficult steps to solving the puzzles and I love how these rooms force you to communicate and work as a team. I'd definitely love to come back and try other rooms in the future."
"Escape room ""The Lost Jungle Safari"" by Brainy Actz in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/brainy-actz-san-diego-the-lost-jungle-safari,2,Omg so much fun! The gal that was assisting was awesome! This was my first time here and didn't know what to expect. She left us in the room with one clue. From there you look for the clue that she gives you and then you find another clue with one of the clues that you just found. We were in The Jungle Room and we had to find the gold skull. We did it under the our time but there were a few glitches that held us up due to someone putting a lock on backwards so there was no way we could ever get the lock opened to get another clue to move on to the next phase. She came in and helped us and figured out what was wrong and then gave us a free clue. You're allowed three Clues if you get stuck within the hour to help you move on. It was fun all of us got along and we did a lot of laughing. Looking forward to going back again.

We opted to do the 'hard mode' version which is 5 additional puzzles. It's a really cool room as the whole thing is a bunch of linear puzzles where each set of 5 has their own start. We ended up finishing with 30 something minutes left and the guy was generous enough to reset the remaining 2 rows of puzzles (normally done with large groups) so that we could do the rest of them. I really enjoyed this room as it was full of all sorts of different puzzles from logic, to word, and everything in between. They really make use of every possible type of puzzle as no two are alike. Definitely one of the more enjoyable Gen-1 rooms I have done.  "

It's perfect for a large group that works well when broken into in smaller groups. Its multi-path style allows for small groups to play together in a public game and still work mostly with their own players within the larger team. It's a weak on story, but very puzzle heavy."

"Escape room ""Ground Zero"" by The Prism Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-prism-escape-rooms-ground-zero,2,This place is awesome!!! My Sister booked the Ground Zero room for today. We had 6 family members and we needed every single one of us to complete this room in the 75 minutes we were given. Before we entered the room we were told Ground Zero only had a 20% success rate. That scared us. 3 of us have never done an escape room. The rooms were decorated great. So many combination locks to open. So many things to figure out just to get to the second room. There is a 3rd small room attached to the second room. While in the 2nd/3rd rooms we only had around 18 minutes left. We started to really worry. We were all sweating to figure out that last combination to get the door open. We made it with 1:46 to spare. When that lock clicked open we all let out a huge celebratory scream. I would highly recommend The Prism Escape Rooms. I would recommend having the maximum 6 people if you choose the Ground Zero room. We all had a fun time!!

She is there to help you out when needed when you give her the correct call to request the help. The Titanic room has about 3 rooms you need to break through to end the game. It's so much fun, just remember to talk out loud with your team, this is not a figure out yourself type of game, or you cover that area and I cover that area. It's really a group effort. "
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,1,We did the Titanic Room with a group of 3 on Sunday. Our little group was pretty new to the escape room scene and we were pretty excited to check it out. The building doesn't look like much from the outside but it's super cute on the inside. Captain Judy explained the scenario and told us how to get hints if we needed them (we needed them!). I don't want to give anything away but all of the rooms were decorated great and we had a fun time figuring out the various puzzles.
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,2,"What a lot of fun in one hour! My wife and I were first-timers. Our friends had done an escape room before with 60out at a different location. Ivan oriented us with the do's and don'ts of the rooms and then we were off on the Titanic (yes, I had a sinking sensation going in). This is not an activity for someone with claustrophobia. Figuring out the clues is very challenging, and we did need to get an assist from ""Captain Ivan"" more than once. But we did escape at 59.5 minutes. And we agreed that we would return for another room in the near future!"
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,3,"LOVE LOVE LOVE these. The rooms are set up sooo well and the puzzles are challenging. Not a lot of locks to unlock, I have nothing against opening a lot of locks, I actually like it but these rooms are so incredibly creative that they are amazing. Also, when they give you hints they are very vague and get you thinking so they don't just give away the answers which I appreciate. They also don't put any other players you don't know in the room with you which is a requirement for us.We've done the Titanic and Zen Room at the Marina Del Ray location and Senator Payne at the West LA location. Judy was our Game Master at the Marina location for both rooms. She was amazing! She was so fun and you could tell she really loves her job. We will be back in a couple weeks to do Outbreak Judy!"
"Escape room ""Titanic"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-titanic,4,"We came to 60out Escape Rooms for the Titanic puzzle. The lobby area is cozy, spacious, and even houses a couple of small games. This was our second escape room experience, and the design of the rooms was top-notch! The difficulty was noticeably harder than our first room, but some puzzles were exceptionally clever! Our game master, Judy, did a great job providing useful hints without directly giving the answer away. Thanks for being so patient with us!"

"Escape room ""The Fun House"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Cross-Roads-Escape-Games-The-Fun-House,2,"LOVED this escape room!!When I first received the invite to come along, I thought okay, what is going to set this one apart from the rest? I've been to my share of escape rooms, some were great, others needed to mature a little more, but after you've done so many, you want to find a uniqueness about the next one.I read the concept of everyone starting off separated into different rooms, that really caught my eye. The idea of everyone being a different character based on a quirky personality test was also nice. I had my eye set on being the detective (which I was able to be ). I watched as my friends became elected into the other positions - the jock, the rebel, the nerd, the virgin and the prom queen.To conquer this escape room, you really need the right dynamic. Everyone has their own puzzles to conquer, but at the same time, one may have something for someone in another room. I don't want to spoil much, but I will speak from being the detective. If you find yourself in this spot, I hope you don't get overwhelmed easy. You are the glue that bonds everyone and it is your responsibility to make sure everyone is okay and gets what they need.I highly recommend this room and will be speaking nothing but good things about it to anyone interested. What a great team at Crossroads, I can't wait to see what rooms you all come up with next."

We had to ask for help in every step and then ask how it was solved and we weren’t even 1/16th through it before our hour was up.   Told them that half of us just sat on the floor and we were so disappoint.   Then they told us it was difficult that they created it and they even had trouble solving it.   Maybe they should tell you this when you are checking in.  I could of found a much better way to spend my $170.  The ones who never had done this before will probably never go to another one.

Very fun and a decent challenge as well! Highly recommend that room! My group did 7 people, but I highly suggest trying to keep the group at 5 people or less. Anything more it gets kinda messy and there's too many people trying to figure out the clues, which causes delay.Can't wait to go back and try another room!

"Escape room ""The Lair"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/thelair-escapedom,0,"So my friend, her father, and I decided that we wanted to go on a fun escape room on a Friday night right? The service and general idea of the room was supposed to be ""not scary"" and we supposedly played a kids version. Late into the game, we got stuck. We asked for a clue and the guide gave us false information and then said ""my bad"" at the end when we couldn't escape. If that wasn't enough, my friend was horrified even though it wasn't supposed to be scary at all. There were mangled dolls draped across the ceiling and eerie sound played in the background. You had to undress a Barbie to find one of the clues, which I personally find extremely disturbing. It was said that we played the kids version, however, many elements of it seemed more mature. We were really bummed at the end since we weren't offered a refund for the mistake that was made. They acted like the issue wasn't a big deal, but the ""customer is always right"". Please note before exposing this to your kids."

Very immersive with good detail.  The puzzles are all excellently thematic and genuinely fun to solve.  My only issue with this room is when you are assigned character roles there is no way to reference what your ""specialties"" are.  If we had a prop of some kind that we could have referenced would have made things quite a bit smoother... maybe that's the point?"

Jumanji is one of our two favorite escape rooms in LA, and Fire & Ice is our third favorite. These are high-quality escape rooms with strong production design and story. They are high-tech escape rooms with lots of magnetic-opens and pretty much no combination or key locks. If you like escape rooms that require you to find combination and keys to open locks, these are not your rooms. But if you like ""OH! THAT'S COOL!"" moments in your escape rooms, 60Out rooms are for you. All of the rooms we did were impressive and amazing, but HANDS DOWN, the Jumanji room will blow your mind with its production value, set design, script, and puzzles. Unlike linear puzzle rooms, several different puzzles can be done simultaneously in this room, which makes it fun for groups. We look forward to doing more 60Out rooms!"

"Escape room ""Secrets in Suburbia"" by Breach Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-scene-escape-rooms-secrets-in-suburbia,0,"Located in an anonymous industrial park off Lambert Street near Lake Forest Drive, The Scene Escape Rooms is a little hard to find but definitely worth the effort. If you’ve never experienced an escape room, the way it works is that your group (in our case, a family of five) is locked in a room and is given 60 minutes to find the way out by solving different puzzles and finding related clues that eventually lead to the key that will open the door to freedom and victory.The reception area is attractive, and the staff is friendly and helpful. We tackled the “Secrets in Suburbia” room, a murder mystery set in a suburban neighborhood circa 1962. The room was well-designed and nicely themed, and the puzzles were detailed and logical. NOTE that there is some math involved in one puzzle, so it may be helpful to bring a calculator – fortunately, my son is an engineer and easily handled the math problems.This was my fourth experience with an escape room, and “Secrets in Suburbia” was probably the room I’ve enjoyed the most so far. I would certainly recommend The Scene!"

We escaped this room with 15 minutes left to spare. Although most of the puzzle are just basic locks and keys, this room uses some more higher tech puzzles than the Houdini room. With that being said I thought that the difficulty level was about same between both. There are lots of puzzles that keep you moving and thinking the entire time and there is never a dull moment. We did have to use our hints and the GM did a great job of pointing us in the right direction yet not blatantly giving us the answer, which I appreciate. 	I am also happy to report that the rooms now have countdowns them! Also the staff is still as amazing and friendly as they were last time. They do a great job explaining the rooms backstory, the rules, and ways to get help if you need it. This time we even got to see some magic tricks while we were waiting for our room. 	If you are looking for an escape room to do that is well themed and well priced, I highly recommend Theme Quest! Can’t wait to go back for the Bonnie and Clyde room! "

We did the Orient Express room and we were definitely impressed by how much they managed to fit into this small room. We had just come off a room at a different company that was very spacious and had many rooms and lots of fancy technology, but we felt like solving the puzzles required too much guesswork and not enough logic. After that, this room was a total breath of fresh air. The staff was also super helpful and friendly. Magic tricks in the lobby was a fun bonus too!

"Escape room ""FBI Interview"" by Riddle Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/riddle-escape-room-fbi-interview,0,"Amazing! My husband and I had been talking about going to an escape room for a while now. We were on vacation and decided to try it out. We did the FBI Interview and had soooooo much fun. So much, that we immediately did The Heist right after we were done. Puzzles are challenging but not impossible. There is also hints given if you are ever completely stuck. Would definitely recommend. Staff is very personable."

"Escape room ""FBI Interview"" by Riddle Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/riddle-escape-room-fbi-interview,3,"The FBI room is my favorite, but each room is fantastic! We have done close to 40 rooms now and nobody can match the room quality and friendly service that the guys at Riddle provide. We happily paid full price even when other rooms had discounts because the experience they provide is so much better! I can't wait for their 4th room to open!"
"Escape room ""FBI Interview"" by Riddle Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/riddle-escape-room-fbi-interview,4,"Did the FBI room with a team of friends from Arizona Camp Sunrise. Not only did we genuinely enjoy every second of the challenge, but we also found the owner, Tolga, to be an incredibly kind and generous guy. He helped us come up with some ideas so we can bring these types of puzzles back to our campers this summer.When you find something that is both highly entertaining and that is run by amazing people, you don't hesitate. You book your group ASAP!"

Highly recommend if you have a mixed group of fun brainiacs, however you don't need to be a genius to contribute but being clever definitely helps. Can't wait to try the next rooms!"

"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,0,The Secret Mission and Lunar Mission are really great intricate puzzles. The story and way you get through the rooms is refreshingly different. They do a few things other escape rooms don't to make you feel completely immersed.
"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,1,"Spy - Barely just a fortnight old, the production for this is the best in my opinion, edging out the castle by a bit. Stepping through the door, you really do get a feel as if you're in a 70s-80s apartment with puzzles cleverly lining throughout the room. The puzzles also blend together well, along with neat uses of several everyday items. Digging the vibe of this room."
"Escape room ""Secret Mission"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-spy-safe-house,2,"My friends and I signed up for the Hotel Escape and were pretty disappointed with the experience, but were told afterward it was the easiest and dullest one to choose.  So we signed up for a later experience where you have to discover the identity of a Russian Spy.  That experience was AWESOME! The rooms were decked out in 60s mid century modern and everything about the clues and room made you feel like you were really into the story.  Even the guy who set us up intro'd it well.  Will definitely be going back to do some of their other more challenging ones!"
"Escape room ""Mad Hatter's Tea Party"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-mad-hatters-tea-party,0,"This was my first escape room. There were 10 of us in total, which made it a little too crowded. We made it out with 14 minutes to spare, so I'd suggest fewer people. It was definitely a good first room, and I enjoyed all the puzzles!"
"Escape room ""Mad Hatter's Tea Party"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-mad-hatters-tea-party,1,I took my two daughters and granddaughter to the Mad Hatter room yesterday and we had a blast!

The room monitor did an excellent job of not helping too much and gave clues when we needed them that still kept it challenging for the girls.....not too easy, but not too hard! Great experience for them! "

Great, friendly staff. Mad Hatter's Tea Room was an excellent challenge. We had a group of 8 and managed to get out with some time remaining. I've been to other escape rooms and this is my favorite so far. They pay attention to detail, not just in the room but the overall company. I will most certainly return and try out their other rooms. Highly recommend."

"Escape room ""Baker Street Mystery"" by Escape Games at The River in Rancho Mirage",https://worldofescapes.com/rancho-mirage/quests/escape-games-at-the-river-baker-street-mystery,1,"The Baker Street Mystery room was the 23rd room for my husband and me, and it did not disappoint! It was definitely a challenging room but not impossible. The owner/game host was really nice, he even stopped the clock when he had to come in and assist with a lock that wouldn't open even though we had the right combination. It was a fun little stop on our vacation, we will come back to try their other rooms the next time we come out to Palm Springs."

Came for a bachelorette party of four girls, and all newbies to the escape room phenom. We were nervous because we didn't know what to expect, especially when the guy told us we picked the hardest room (Baker Street Mystery). But it was a BLAST! And it was challenging without being impossible, really had to use your brain but it was exciting and fun! Would love to come back to try the other rooms! A definite must do! :)"

"Escape room ""The Ghost of Mentryville"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-ghost-of-mentryville,0,"We had a double date here last week and we had a great time! 5 stars from start to finish.  We got a little lost (note 405B is NOT next to 405A). We called and the front desk girl ran out and flagged us down.  My husband and I had done escape rooms before, but our friends had not. The girl who checked us in was very clear with her instructions and answered all questions.  She definitely made them feel more comfortable with the game.  I know it can be intimidating for people who don't know what to expect! We did the Mentryville escape room.  It was SO much fun, and I was really proud of our completion. First of all, thank goodness 4 people are the max. I have been to an escape room around the same size where they stuffed 8 people in and I honestly thought I would pass out. The puzzles were ingenious! And I have to say the ghost (Tony/Samuel) was excellent.  We would highly recommend this escape room and we look forward to doing another one sometime soon."
"Escape room ""The Ghost of Mentryville"" by Arcane Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/arcane-escape-rooms-the-ghost-of-mentryville,1,"We loved the Ghost of Mentryville. It was part escape room and part interactive theater. Our ""live"" host helped guide us through the adventure. In some rooms, the live actor either jump scares you or gives you hints. The actor in this room really is part of the room and sets the eerie, but not scary mood.  The puzzles and tasks in this room are clever and some of the best integrated I have seen and experienced in any room. The set pieces and narration transport you to places well beyond the confines of the room itself and your imagination fleshes out even more details.  There is no strict time limit for this room and the guidance is generous. There is an urgency to complete this room because of the need to resolve situations and close the loop. Good things come in small escape rooms."

They were so detailed and they were very challenging. We signed up for the jail break room which was crazy hard but soooo much fun I would totally recommend even if you can't make it out. We didn't and had so much fun we decided to do another room. We did the saloon room also which was awesome!!! You get unlimited hints but they make you wait at least ten min to try and work together. Great for team building. Our team, karly and Brooke, were outstanding and so helpful! They walked us through the rooms when we didn't get it and answered all questions we had. This was my first experience and it was a great one thanks t this place and these ladies!"
"Escape room ""The Manor"" by The Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-room-la-the-manor,0,"Our group of 5 did The Manor a few weeks ago. It is a good mix of tech and traditional code/key locks. There are some reveals and elements that are reminiscent of the Haunted Mansion and The Munsters(for Boomers like me). Costumes(optional) are provided and add some comic relief and role playing aspects to this room. There are a few clues that are a little confusing, even after a hint. All in all, the three room here are definitely worth doing and are distinctively different experiences."

Really cool system - one of the mirrors actually doubled as a TV for typed hints.

This was our first game since doing 3 lackluster rooms in Socal. We were not disappointed. Lots of puzzles and games to stimulate the ""little grey cells"". Our gamemaster was Sean who, as always, was a great clue giver. He made our visit fun and worthwhile. (Thx, Sean!) The room was family friendly, bright, colorful and fun. After the experience, we signed up to do the VR escape room for my husband's birthday next month. We can't wait! We highly recommend this business as ""must-do"" to locals and travelers alike."

The asymmetrical racing room When Worlds Collide is such a fun competition. Be sure to get enough people to split into two groups because the racing component is incredibly enticing. But make sure to double book so the teams can switch rooms and do it again! I seriously loved both ""worlds"" so much that I would have been disappointed had we not done both in one day. Cool theming. Clever puzzles. Fun competition. The owner and all the staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. "
"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,1,"4.5 starsWe had a smaller group this time (4) compared to to our usual escape group but that wasn't going to stop us! The fates of two realms hung in the balance! We also happened to have two 13 year olds with us and one of them had no experience in escape rooms so we wanted a place that would be a good introduction. I was intrigued by the asymmetrical set up of the When Worlds Collide room. So much that it overcame my worries that it would be too much for an inexperienced player and such a small group. Without giving anything away, this particular game is set up so that two groups can play against each other! One in the ""Fantasy realm"" and one in ""Reality"". Its essentially the same story, and the groups don't really interact with each other except for the fact that only one realm can be triumphant. Other escape rooms I've played with two separate groups I'd consider a parallel setup because both groups play two copies of the same room, and whichever group finishes first wins. Here, whoever finishes first wins but the two rooms are completely different so if you are so inclined, you can come back and play the other side so try to avoid spoilers after your post game sharing! All this makes When World's collide a great option for a large group. Up to twelve people can play (6 in each realm). Or even as small a group as ours with some experienced players (2 in each realm). Or take your normal group and play each side on different occasions, that's an option as well! Thanks to our game master Chris for explaining and giving us our clues. We had a great time! The only thing that we noticed is that the temp could get a bit hot in the rooms so dress appropriately! I found that we were concentrating on our mission so intently that it wasn't all that of an inconvenience but I'm sure some would like to know."
"Escape room ""When Worlds Collide"" by 3rd Day Escape in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/3rd-day-escape-when-worlds-collide,2,"I was in a group of 6 who did the When Worlds Collide room. We split into two groups of 3 and competed against each other - one group in fantasy and one in reality. We had so much fun that we went back the next night to compete again, with the teams switching rooms. I did the reality room the first night, which I thought was a bit more challenging than the fantasy room. We were on the last puzzle when the time ran out. The group in the fantasy room still had several puzzles left to get through. The 2nd night I did the reality room and we made it out with 12 minutes to spare. We had such a great time in both rooms, and the girls who worked there were fantastic. I don't want to say too much and give anything away, but if you have a large group I highly recommend checking out When Worlds Collide!"

A friend and I did the Mystery Lodge room. It was certainly a challenge with just two of us, but our guide, Adam, did a great job of laying out the scenario and giving us hints that were juuust enough to keep us going without feeling like we were having our hands held. He definitely helped draw us into the experience with his intro.I was very surprised by the quality of the room as well. Wherever I expected something go be a bit 'low budget', I was pleasantly wrong. There is a lot of thought and effort to making a lot of these secret hatches cool and surprising. Just when I thought something was only another decoration, a puzzle would pop it open.The whole place was clean and professional too. A definite thumbs up, and ill be back for sure with more people to try one of the larger rooms.Thanks again Adam!"

Room was super fun, creative, and the owner Rick was a hoot. Highly recommended. This one deserves more way attention from the community. I've done more than 100 rooms worldwide, and this is one of the more memorable ones. Superbly well executed and staged. Check it out!"

Mary was the one that helped us get started and she was the sweetest person ever. So helpful during the game as well. After the fact, Kevin was able to help us wrap up and was super enthusiastic as well. Glad I'm a part of their loyalty program. :)"
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,0,"This review comes from a group that has completed about 20 escape rooms across the nation, including in cities such as Orlando, St. Louis, Las Vegas. We have encountered some so-so rooms, some decent rooms, and some amazing rooms. What we LOVE - They don’t mix you with strangers in the rooms! That is awesome! This room, the Zombie Lab, was a little bit of a disappointment for us. We had previously done, over several years, both the Bank Heist and the Western room at this venue. The western themed room has the best theming of them all, as it is the most immersive, though even there you’ll see odds and ends that appear to be incomplete, like a certain ceiling tile installation/work-around that looks sloppy.  First off - TONS of locks. Locks, locks, locks! That is typical of many entry-level rooms. The puzzles ARE fun, but not many of the puzzles relate to the stories! It seems like the rooms are decorated, and then filled with a hodgepodge of random puzzles that don’t actually contribute to the theme or the story. You’re walking around thinking, “How is this puzzle related to the story at all?”  Another aspect that is a bit of a letdown: Having to watch an intro video in the lobby in front of other groups. It’s just awkward standing around a television next to the counter to watch a poorly written (and full of grammatical errors and misspellings!) video before entering the room. Lastly, it would be nice if the employees conveyed some enthusiasm for the job at hand. The instruction segment given to each group by the employee is too long and rushed. It’s a LOT of talking for them, and they talk fast to get through it, which is just annoying for everybody. The instructions should be more concise. Our favorite to least favorite room at his ensue: #1 Wild West (We were told the owners built this one themselves - They’ve obviously learned a lot from running the other two rooms) #2 The Bank Robbery #3 Zombie Lab "
"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Fox in a Box Tucson in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,1,I took my 18 year old son and niece to the Zombie Lab. We had a great time and can't wait to try another scenario.

It is such a unique and creatively decorated space- the details really draw you in.  We arrived the 15 minutes early as you are supposed to and were greeted by the owner.  She was super friendly, energetic and you could tell that this place was a passion project for her and her husband.  She chatted us up about their business and we could tell that a lot of planning went into the whole thing.A few minutes later her husband and our game master walked us through our scenario for ""Spellbound"".   My hubby and I were the only two slotted for this spot.  That was a good thing since others were supposed to be with us and the room was a small space.  I am glad we didn't have other people in there or we would have been a bit crammed.  The room was neat.  It had a good combination of technology, quirkiness, puzzles and good old need for attention to details.  We have done about 10 escape rooms between us before this one and it was thoughtfully created and a good level of difficulty.  We made it out with 4 minutes to go too!  It is definitely worth the visit.  I can't wait to check out one of their other rooms next time we are in town!"

After some chatting he told us the back story to 'The Will,' their newest room. We went in having read the prologue, but not really knowing what to expect. We were brought into the room and locked inside this beautiful office.

The story is incredible, the decorations so realistic and the puzzles super AMAZING ! We are a bit sad that it is the only escape room we didn't escape (only for 20 seconds). We don't remember the name of the girl that hosted us, but thank you so much for letting us finish the game despite the time that was over.I don't know if it's because it was our very first escape room, but we really had a blast ! We loved the fact that almost all the pieces in the room were to be used, not too much useless information that could lead you to a false way.

I did the insane asylum with my girlfriend's family today and we really enjoyed the clever puzzles, creepy ambiance, and fantastic receptionist. The only thing I would change is the size for the price. I totally understand there's only so much that can be done with the size of the house, and while definitely worth it, I think that a larger place with more puzzles and traveling (inside, outside, roof access, adjacent housing, etc.) would really add to the experience. I could definitely see myself spending a bit more for a couple hours in a mansion solving similar puzzles--but that's just me.All that said, this was a whole lot of fun and I will be back!"

"Escape room ""Insane Asylum"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-insane-asylum,5,"WOOHOO! We escaped the Asylum and with an additional 20 minutes to spare too!The concept is simple, you and your group of 5 friends are locked in a dark room and you have 1 hour to find a key to escape. The clock counts down and you are left scrambling through props and items in the room to solve puzzles and quizzes in hopes of finding clues to get out. Prior to starting the game, they will go over the rules and have you sign waivers. I've played several escape room games and this one was challenging yet really fun! I would highly suggest it for a first timer player. Tips:-The best way to solve the clues is to work together. I can't stress enough that team work is vital! Keep track of your clues and communicate with everyone so you don't have 5 people looking for the same clues. -Wear comfortable clothes! It can get really hot/cold in the rooms so wear something you feel comfortable moving around in.-Keep hydrated and use the restroom beforehand. You will be LOCKED in the room for an hour!-Be very observant. There's clues everywhere! Look underneath stuff, in cervices, high above you, move things around...etc-Parking is terrible here! We ended up parking right next to the building because we couldn't fit our car in the tiny driveway. Make sure you tell them where you parked your car so you don't get towed."

It's a bit hard to find parking on the busy Barham Blvd, but there is street parking if you look for it.I have done both the Asylum and the Bunker rooms and they are both fun in their own way.  Without giving away too much, I liked the puzzles in the Bunker and the atmosphere in the Asylum.  Everything is pretty well thought out.  The hour flies by.  I love the tension and relief of every puzzle.  It's very satisfying to hear that *click* when a lock is open.They have great customer service and guide you through what you need to know about the experience.  I'm definitely ready for the next room!"
"Escape room ""Insane Asylum"" by PanIQ Escape Room Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/paniq-entertainment-insane-asylum,7,"This was a crazy crazy experience! I loved trying it once but I'm not sure I can do it again. Haha this kind of experience is aimed toward gamers who like to solve puzzles on the spot. I'm the take my time kind of person so this was so fast paced for me. I came here with a group of 6 to try out the Bunker room. Parking is really crazy with a max of three cars pulling into a narrow lane in front of the place. Carpool if you can! Before the craziness starts you get a lot of info and then of goes the timer.I would suggest bringing as many people as possible because you need all the thinking brains! Video gamers highly recommended haha. We all had a lot of fun and were just running all over the place and we were able to solve it under the given time limit. Pretty cool but not the shortest time ever! We were aiming for that of course but not all dreams get fulfilled. Even though I wasn't the main puzzle solver I still had a lot of fun doing this experience. There's a good mix of puzzle solving and just finding clues that there is a lot to do. It's good to try this at once, and if you like it, there are other rooms too!"

My group of five has done about 20 escape room across the nation, and this was not the worst we've done, but not the best.The decor looked old, dirty, and worn out. It also seemed quite sparse, like someone threw this room together hastily in their garage or something. The puzzles were okay, but one of them seemed completely nonsensical and we're not sure how average folks are intended to guess how it works without assistance. Maybe we're dumb, but there's only one room we didn't completely in our entire history of playing escape games; And we rarely ever ask for clues..So, who's to say?I would recommend the Six Shooter room over this one any day.

However, ever since they hired a new game master & revamped the room. it is definitely a more difficult room from before. My wife & I have done 29 room & this  Cabin was great. we did not get out in time & the clues were helpful & followed the story.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day? Go, go do it now."

We took the Harry Potter challenge and I was amazed at the level of detail and the sheer brilliance of the clues and their hiding places. I'm scared of revealing too much but my favorite clues were the deceptively easy ones (clues that looked easy but were surprisingly difficult). I have one suggestion: I recommend putting out a poll or suggestion box for different rooms so that you guys can get more ideas for future room themes (My suggestions for a potential theme are a Sherlock Holmes or Clue theme). I can't wait for the next room change and I highly recommend it to people who want to play with friends or clubs who are looking to build teamwork! ORDER OF THE PHOENIX FOR LIFE!

This is an excellent alternative for when you're looking for something to do and want a different option than going to the movies/bowling/karaoke. The clues are never the same, the rooms are beautifully decorated, and the whole thing from start to finish is very immersive. Definitely go check it out!"

Since I played the Treasury of Empire: Allies, I knew that this time would not be an easy game. Although this time was still for the theme room the Treasury of Empire, the puzzles were totally different due to the different story line. The agent side was differently in the room, puzzles, and clues. On this sides, it had more electronic stuffs. It made the game to be more interesting. Also, I like the idea of the telephone. It made me feel like I was in a real base try to get the secrete code. I love it! Still the great experience."

More people with great team work will definitely higher helpful!Before the game started, the game master introduced the background story to us. In fact, all three rooms in this store are all connected together. I believe we should started with the first part of story to see the whole story. With the brief introduction from the game master, we knew that we have traveled back to WWII time and trying to get out of this military base. With this story introduction, we have had the idea about why we are here and what we are looking for. I believe that introduce is very important. Also, he told us many tips and rules.Generally, this is a great escape room experience. Although the game is not easy, we still enjoy the game very much. I like this type of challenge!"

"Escape room ""Zookeeper"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-zookeeper,0,Had a great time working in the Mad Hatter's Tea Party for my daughter's 14th birthday. We were paired with 4 others that we did not know but worked to have the best time of the week!

"Escape room ""Zookeeper"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-zookeeper,2,What a blast. We did the zookeeper room since we had our 8 year old and 3 year old with us and it was perfect. Our 3 year old was busy with all the animal things in the room and the rest of us were busy solving our mission. Nothing like a room for 6-12 year olds to make an adult feel a little less than though haha Hands down recommend this for anyone who wants to be fully engulfed in a game and have fun. We will absolutely return.
"Escape room ""Time Machine"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-time-machine,0,"By almost any measure, the nautilus and time machine rooms were very good escape rooms. Do they have faults? Yes. The ""kraken"" you battle in the Nautilus looks like an original Nintendo character, reminding you of a 90s video game as opposed to an immersive experience. And many parts of the Time Machine room feel like an underwhelming museum exhibit. But overall, these are above average escape rooms that in most other cities would be top-of-the-line.I would say these are perfect escape rooms for new participants. They are immersive, and creative, and generally fun. They will deliver solid experiences to establish what escape rooms are all about.For experienced gamers, however, these rooms were let downs. The puzzles were too straightforward and predictable, These rooms were linear to a fault. And the production value does not match the leaders in the city (Questroom and the Basement). That said, 60Out offers reasonable pricing and still very enjoyable experiences. I expect to return for some of their more advanced rooms such as Jumanji."

The host couldn't have been much nicer.  He was friendly and inviting.  The ambiance was warm.  They have lockers so you can store your personal belongings while you are in the escape room.  Puzzle are fun.  Even the easier riddles/puzzles can be challenging when out under pressure.  You are given an hour to escape the room.  Definitely coming back to try the other themed rooms.

I feel that this was the easiest of the three rooms we did.  I thought the puzzles were challenging, but simple enough to figure out.  I don't think that there was a moment where we didn't know what we were supposed to do in this room.  It's easy to connect the dots and figure out what to do.  I would say this is an easy-intermediate difficulty room, and would recommend this if this is your first time or if you aren't that experienced at escape rooms.  We were told that Stage Call is their easiest room at Subscape, so if you are a beginner, you can start there as well.  "

More than any other escape room we have done, there is a definite cause and effect with things you manipulate. There is good audio and visual confirmation when something is done correctly. Our group produced some genuine squeals, eeks, and a bonafide scream or two. It is not gory, freaky, or bloody and those who are not horror fans should be fine in this room.We escaped with quite a few hints, but I was glad we were able to experience the entire room and all its tricks and treats."

I am amazed that this is a local business, because it is as high a quality as many of the larger chain escape rooms. It was a really well thought out room, I would say one of my favorites of all time. It was challenging, one of the tougher rooms I have done, but with some clues and good help we escaped.

You can definitely tell that a lot of work went into it to make it as immersive as possible. Please take note though that I played with 2 other people and some of the puzzles would be easier to achieve with 1 or maybe two more people. Also attention to detail is needed for this room as it is easy to miss items you are needing to find in order to do some of the puzzles. Our game master Aly was fun and refreshingly enthusiastic! Thank you for the fun experience!"

They are quite deserving of their High Production Value/Immersive award that they won for their Amazon Rainforest room. From start to finish, that room was one of my all-time favorites. So much attention to detail and overall fun. And the price is even lower than other Escape Rooms. Their Gravitational Effect room was a step-down in puzzle quality, though the interior design was still above-average. I especially enjoyed the physical dynamic in the middle room. Gift shops usually put me off, but in the lobby you can buy beautiful flowers hand-made by the owner. It was a nice touch.Games played: Amazon Rainforest, Gravitational Effect"

Ada the trapped Robot became a friend and ally of invaluable worth as we strove to save us all before the power drained out for the ""subterranean"" lab we had stumbled into.

"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,2,"This experience was quite fun, at first I was a bit hesitant to try this because the thought of being locked in a room with strangers just didn't appeal to me. After my first escape room, I couldn't wait to try all of others. I've seen 3 of the escape rooms from Escape Room LA and their all very well produced and designed, compared to a few others I've seen that aren't nearly as well produced. Once you step into a room, you feel like you're in the environment of the game. Even though you may be a room with strangers, it's fun to be able to talk and meet with new people even if it is for an hour. It's definitely a good way to spend an hour to an hour and a half in LA if you're visiting LA with some free time."
"Escape room ""The Detective"" by Escape Room LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-room-la-the-detective,3,"*The Detective*Damn Gina - we didn't escape! :( But overall the entire experience was super fun and a nice alternative to do something different!Diving into the deets:You go into this kinda shady looking building and wonder if you're at the right place, on the outside it looks pretty rundown and nondescript, but trust you're at the right spot. Once you arrive, you'll be waiting in the hallway with others until they call you in. Check in is simple: show your email confirmation on your phone or print out. After, they asked we go around the room and introduce ourselves and give a tiny blurb about yourself, which was a nice icebreaker especially since we didn't know the others that signed up for the same event. Next, they went over the rules and hinted at a couple of things, but nothing that would take away the guesswork from us. The staff waited a couple of minutes past our slotted time for the 2 missing people in our group, but they ended up a no show. There's a last chance to use the restroom, make sure you take it because once you ask to leave the room, you aren't allowed to go back in.Once in the room, they started a clock and we broke into an immediate frenzy. It's good to work in pairs and call out to everyone if you found a clue. Meanwhile, there was a staff member dressed as a detective inside the room and a few times he hinted at something if we half-uncovered a clue and were struggling, in a major way. Without him, I honestly don't think we would have solved 3-5 clues... I could see how some people would be really frustrated if they got stuck.Anyway, the next hour went by REALLY quick! Like a lot of the other reviews say: Teamwork + Communication is KEY to well, find the key! The puzzles overall were fun, some more challenging than others, but clever nonetheless and you had to solve all of them in order to find the key. Time ran out and we didn't escape but had a great time anyway. I'd be interested in trying The Cavern.In the end, the only thing I could think they could improve on is:-Rather than allowing 12 people into a room, I'd say 6-8 max is better.-Allow an additional 10-15 minsThe staff was great in offering to take pictures after the event, even when they were literally given 7 different cameras and took multiple photos on each device. We left with a coupon for their other events, i.e. RaceLA, CityRace.Anyway, last tips:Plan ahead by allotting plenty of time before your scheduled event. Parking is in DTLA where majority of the streets are one-way and if you're trying to save yourself a few dollars, you'll most likely circle around a couple of times before deciding on where to park. The lot right next to building where you do the event was $7 on a Saturday, cash only. HAVE FUN and GOOD LUCK!!!"

I think we would have solved faster with one more person but we made it out with 19 seconds to spare! The hints are good and we didn't need to use any clues, which cost time. This one was also cool because you start in a dark room and have to figure out how to turn on the lights! Not totally dark, but you definitely need to get the lights figured out first."

Definitely a tough room, but nothing short of amazing! I'd recommend to anyone!I just wasn't sure what the storyline was. When we got there, the initial employee that introduced us to the waivers and instructional video was great - but then we got passed off to another guy who brought us to the wrong room at first and I don't know if we were explained the whole story when we got to the correct one. Then when we asked for the first clue, they gave us a clue for a wrong room. Luckily I recalled their mix up earlier and clarified if they were giving a clue for World Of Illusions, and they acknowledged that they gave us the wrong walkie (which wasn't even synced to the 1st room they put us in; it was for the 3rd room).When we solved the room - there was no fanfare. And as we left, there's no enthusiasm. We totally forgot to take a photo too for escaping - I wish there was more excitement when we escape and then a reminder to take a photo. Maybe there would be if we didn't use hints.I just can't wait to go back and play the other rooms because the tricks and locks and clues are high tech and wonderful.

"Escape room ""Masquerade Manor"" by Escape Room 831 in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-831-masquerade-manor,2,"This is the BEST escape room I have gone to. The rooms were very detailed, high tech, clean, and very thought out. The hints do not cost you time and are very clear without giving away what to do. The game masters were very present and considerate, we never waited very long for a response. My group was small so we were paired with another couple. They ensured that things would be fair and made sure we knew one person from their group (2 people) had to agree to a hint before they gave one. They were very welcoming from start to finish, they don't rush you at any point. I highly recommend visiting them! They have 2 locations. You will not regret it! P.S. photos are of their waiting room with puzzles and some awesome seating. They have intricate brass chandeliers too that are very pretty."

The challenges we were tasked at solving were age appropriate, anxiety provoking (in a good way) and of course a lot of fun. You have ample opportunity to try to solve problems and help is readily available by phone. Most of all, it's fairly affordable at about $35 a person. Will definitely do this again!"
"Escape room ""Operation: Santa's List"" by Back in Time Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/back-in-time-escape-rooms-operation-santas-list,0,Solid escape room.  The themes were thoughtful and relatively well done.  I did two here.  The seasonal Christmas theme was good for the kids but you can tell was not as well integrated into the puzzles.  I find the best escape rooms integrate the puzzles into the story or logic of the escape in such a way that one does not feel like one is doing a puzzle just for the puzzles sake or just to get to the next puzzle.  It really does feel like you are solving a mystery and are performing some deductions and detective work.  The Santa Operations felt like one puzzle after another.  Still the kids had fun.  I have done one of the other staple Escape Rooms and felt like it was well done.  Definitely worth doing with friends or the family.  This is a well run escape room company and serves the customers well.  The staff was friendly.

The staff were really friendly and professional and it was clean and well organized. We all left wanting to come back. Thanks guys!"
"Escape room ""The Dynasty - Royal Library"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-iteration-royal-library,0," This is my first escape room and it was fun! I came here in a group of 6 and we tried the Royal Library room (first room). Everything there had a purpose and required us to be very resourceful! We could work on multiple puzzles at once so if we couldn't figure one out right away, we could always focus on the other. We barely got frustrated/stuck for a long time and used 2 hints in the first room. There are also some pretty cool tech things/mechanics and some things could be deceiving! Also, I really like how the rooms have some sort of storyline - I think it becomes more interesting.Solving the first room led us to the Alley (second room) and we used our remaining time from the 1 hour time limit to explore/solve things. I think the transition from the library to alley was the most frustrating part because only 2 people could work on the puzzle (very clever but took too long and I had nothing to do) to get us all into the second room. But that second room was actually really pretty. I actually came back with a different group of friends to try the 2nd room, but I thought the first room's puzzles were better (2nd room was also crowded).I would suggest using up all your remaining hints to get as far as you can on your second room because we wouldn't have completed the second room given the amount of time we had left - but perhaps we could've gotten farther. Also, don't play with the pocketwatch they lend you because I accidentally stopped it and couldn't tell how much time I had left OOPS :P Finally, a huge thanks to the guy working there. He's super nice and helpful! He also explained the hints really well (and straight to the point so that we didn't waste time) when we needed help. We even got a photo printed at the end for completing the room, hurrah!"
"Escape room ""The Dynasty - Royal Library"" by Legend X in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/legend-x-iteration-royal-library,1,"Super fun! This is my first time at an escape room. I had never even heard of the concept before this. My husband and I had so much fun playing the Royal Library. We were the only ones who reserved the 5pm timeslot on Friday evening and we got done solving everything before time ran out. You get 1 hour which is a good amount of time. There were a lot of interesting things to find and the puzzles were really tricky and fun to solve. I loved the special effects and the super powers you need to use to unlock hidden objects to reveal the clues. Cool use of technology! I would highly recommend trying it out. I really appreciate getting a printed team photo at the end. What a cool souvenir to remember the experience by! The staff is super friendly, helpful, and nice!"

"Escape room ""Wizard's Workshop"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-wizards-workshop,2,"Our wizarding apprentice Judy was super helpful though we took no hints, her briefing and intro got us going. Our experience in the wizarding room went really well for a mixed group that some had escape room experience and some didn't. The room has cool tech and interactive puzzles. We had some really cool moments after solving them."
"Escape room ""Wizard's Workshop"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-wizards-workshop,3,"Wow, this place was awesome! I've done three escape rooms so far at other places, but this is definitely my favorite! On Halloween, we showed up to do the Wizard's Workshop one, and we were running late, but Damien (who was totally awesome, by the way!) was super chill and flexible and set up the room great for us and got us really excited to do it! And man, was it fun! Really great quality puzzles that were solvable and logical, but still very challenging... Awesome design and theming, and Damien was attentive and enthusiastic and made it a great experience! We all agreed this was maybe our most fun Halloween we've ever had. Thanks guys, can't wait to try another one of your rooms soon! "
"Escape room ""Wizard's Workshop"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-wizards-workshop,4,"I've played around 10 escape rooms now, and the 3 rooms I've done with 60Out were amazing! I've played Titanic and Wizard Workshop at their Marina Del Rey location, and Mystery of Senator Payne at their West LA location. Titanic was a little easy, but a lot of the puzzles were really innovative and impressive. Wizard Workshop was a lot of fun, but it's the hardest of the three of done so far. Definitely save it for when you have a bit more experience with escape rooms. Parking at Marina is easy, there was a lot right next to the building that we were able to use."
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,0,This was a lot of fun! Definitely want to come back for the Crime Scene Room.
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,1,Great time with visiting Family from Oklahoma. We did good.
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,2,"Done a number of Escape Rooms in LA & this one beat them all! We did The Temple and the room was clean, everything worked properly, clues were HIGH QUALITY and the story was fun! Even more so, the lady who sets up the group for the room was a great storyteller and did a great job of setting the atmosphere before we even started. We are going back again this weekend to try their next room!"
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,3,"I did the Secret Temple room with 7 other people for a friends bday party.  It was $25 each.  It was definitely a fun activity, but it wasn't as logic, puzzle-solving centered as I expected.  There was more trial and error and a little randomness involved.The man and woman that greeted us were fun, nice and engaging.  The guy continued on to monitor us in the room and was helpful (with clues) when we needed it.  Obviously this whole operation was set up and is run by some fun & creative people.  I see in some of the other reviews people mentioning an actress, but maybe we didn't get that far?!  I would definitely try a different room or other escape activity but didn't love this one.  It was a little more frustrating than it was fun in retrospect because I think that specific puzzle needed a main clue to bind all the random stuff together (maybe as a hint, they could reveal another framed clue that would give you an idea of what move you need first instead of the monitor giving verbal clues).  I'm not going into any detail so as not to give anything away.I also think a few details would make the room aesthetically a lot more cooler and make you feel like you are actually in a secret temple room.  There was laminating (which I get makes things last longer but just printing out new little papers seems worth it to heighten the experience) and labels/stickers that kind of took you right out of the secret temple and into Staples. lol.  I'd rate this experience a 3.5 but since everyone else's reviews are so high and it was worth trying, I don't want to lowball!  I'm curious to try the Apt. 205 room since people seem to love that one!"
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,4,Writing this review after our second visit to this amazing escape room! It all starts with the awesome staff! They really have gone the extra mile to intelligently design the rooms. Loved the exciting twists and turns while keeping to the theme from start to finish. On our first visit we were not able to solve The Secret Temple - it left us scratching our heads and more determined to complete a room. We came back to try Apartment 205 and solved it. We had so much fun we had to try the Temple again... Second time was a charm and we were able to solve it too... with clues from the secret society of course ;-) we can't wait for room three. We will be back again! Enigma Escape Rooms makes for a fun night with friends! Six thumbs up!
"Escape room ""The Secret Temple"" by Enigma Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/secret-temple-la,5,"Awesome experience! I think it's very unique although i've only been to the Exit game. But reading all the reviews, this would be one of the top.This experience is for sure worth it. Me and my co-workers have tried the Secret Temple, and Boy, our mind was boggled! They really put a lot of effort and thought with the puzzles and combinations. Lots and lots of surprises.I love how they have a narrator with you who's a really good actress. You can ask for a hint which i suggest, would be really helpful to get out.Online booking was great, they have a really good website, easy to navigate and great price! Parking is not bad, you have a few parking space at the back of the building. Great Area, and i love the interior setting. Can't wait to try Apartment 205!!!"

This was the first escape room experience for the majority of the group and they were nervous about getting started. But the room was very engaging and interesting, so they got into it right away. The puzzles/problems were a great combination of difficulty and cleverness that picked the brains of even the seasoned escape room participants.

"Escape room ""Chemical Lab"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-chemical-lab,0,Probably the hardest of the Lock Down rooms as of Nov. 2018. My wife and I have done 50+ rooms and solved this room with only 2 minutes to spare. Better played with 3-5 players. The immersion was realistic. Perfect mix of modern and unique traditional elements nicely themed. I highly recommend any of the Lock Down rooms. The staff was friendly and polite.

"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,0,"The room was pretty well done although I thought it was a little too dark. We did have a flashlight and a lantern, though. The puzzles were a little too easy (all of us had only done one or two rooms before). I wish the timer appeared in all of the rooms, but it was only visible in the first room. We could only communicate to the game master through a walkie talkie, which was unexpected. Sometimes it was a little challenging to understand them. I think the room used its space well, and we only ever felt too crowded in the first room (with 6 people). We did end up finishing with over 20 minutes. I think everyone still had a good time. "
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,1,We did the Wild West room on a double date and it was so much fun! We were talking about it the rest of the weekend. We can't wait to go back and try another challenge.
"Escape room ""Wild West"" by PanIQ Escape Room Phoenix in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paniq-entertainment-west,2,"THIS WAS AWESOME! My husband, mom (visiting from out of town) and I did this on a free evening we had together because we had all heard of escape the rooms and wanted to do one. We wanted to do this as a bonding activity but also because all three of us enjoy good challenges. Typically, my mom and my husband are competitive and I'm the one telling everyone ""it's only a game, calm down!"" However, by the end, I was cursing (I don't curse) and getting frustrated as a completive side I never see in myself was coming out. We failed the room, going over our 60 minute time by 3 minutes or so. It IS challenging doing the room with only 3 people (as it says on their website) partially because there were times when my husband and mother were solving a clue in one part of the room and meanwhile I was trying to solve a clue on my own in the other corner. Time is of the essence and the more minds working together, the better. However, it is by no means impossible to do this with only two or three people.We did the Wild West room and we felt like this was a good challenge level for us since this is our first escape room (we've heard that at PanIQ, the Kidnapping room is the most challenging with the Alien room being a close second). We would have finished the room in time (I imagine) but we didn't realize it was ""okay"" to ask for hints. Although the lovely woman working there told us we could, we figured that a) that was ""cheating"" and b) we were going to escape this room ourselves, gosh dernit! In the future, we will phone in a few times and ask for hints...! So again, this location is not ""too tough"" to complete as some other puzzle rooms I've seen reviews of in the Phoenix area. They want you to have fun! We will definitely be coming back with more family and friends in the future. It was SUCH a blast! We will be talking about this for a long time afterward."

We asked if we could leave him, but just like the forest: ""Pack it in, pack it out...don't litter"". The staff was friendly and considerate. We needed a LOT of clues!

It definitely adds to the creepiness of the room. Unfortunately, our group did not escape Blaine's Basement (because we were so terrified of the darkness in the room). But when we told our other friends to do it, they escaped and loved it. One of our favorites rooms in all of Arizona.Definitely recommend their ""Quest for the Throne"" and ""Condo"" rooms also.

We had so much fun with this in a ""hotel room"" theme trying to track down a kidnapper who had us trapped in the room. Trying to find clues and get out of there in one hour is a challenge but we had a blast. We didn't quite breakout, but were very close! The staff even helped along the way. They gave us 3 free clues we could ask for at any time if we were stumped.

"Escape room ""The Assassins"" by Escape Room Salinas in Salinas",https://worldofescapes.com/salinas/quests/escape-room-salinas-the-assassins,2,"Was here this Saturday for a work team building exercise.  This was my first time doing an ""escape room"" event. There was no wait and it was not busy, but then again we made an appointment for 11am.  They have a large waiting area and water bottles for sale for a dollar. We were a group of 10 but we were broken up into two groups of 5.  My group did the Assassin themed escape room and we had an hour to escape.  I have to say it was fun albeit the puzzles were challenging (so many locks!).  The room we were in was nicely decorated to the theme, and it had a nice ""creepy"" ambiance to it to set the mood.  I don't want to say too much and give it away, but overall it was nicely done. The owner is nice, and she also provides up to three hints if you get stuck.  The only downside is that they have a small parking lot.  I recommend carpooling especially if you are a big group like mine.I definitely recommend this place if you love solving puzzles with friends/family and/or as a team building exercise.  We definitely learned teamwork and how to quickly share ideas to get the task done.  It is too bad that I am not close by to Salinas because I would like to come back here again to do the other themes."

They did a great job utilizing the actor sparingly in the room which I much prefer than having them standing over your shoulder the whole time. These are must do rooms no matter what your escape room experience is. They have set the bar even higher!

"Escape room ""Central Intelligence"" by Down the Rabbit Hole in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/down-the-rabbit-hole-central-intelligence,0,"We are big lovers of escape rooms, but this was easily the worst room we have ever tried. We did the CIA room, and it was so convoluted to the point that it was not even fun. We used all three of our clues and still couldn't progress without help. We are not stupid or incompetent, this room was just not designed well at all. I would not recommend this company to anyone. It was really disappointing too because we had some ""first timers"" with us, but the experience was so poor that they may never want to try another one. Very upset- total waste of money."

We had so much fun. Having never done an escape room before, I was not sure what to expect. The puzzles were engaging and each unique. The story lines within each unique section of the puzzle kept our team active the entire time. We did the space themed room with 4 people and that felt about the right amount. I would highly recommend a trip to Nightwalker Caverns for any reason! I especially enjoyed that it is opened and operated as a family business. The father/daughter team were very passionate about the amount, variety, and complexity of puzzles. They're even traveled world-wide in their escape room quests. Again, highly, highly, highly recommend!!!"

"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,0,"I'm the Owner of Escape Game Alaska and regarding Julie's review, I just want to share this because I clearly remember the two of them as customers. I would never feel the need to write this but I do feel that, as business owners, we live in a world where customers are able to review us but we, as business owners, are not given the opportunity to respond. While I am grateful to have customers play and avidly try to make it through the game, I also need to ensure that my prop decor, investments in making the rooms authentic and detailed, and game pieces do not get damaged- so that other players can play the game as well. During the game, it was clear that there was not a lot of respect for the facility or objects in the game room. (NOTE: some of the books in the rooms are antiques that were gifted to us with the intent of us caring for them; I intend to uphold that responsibility. As well, if a game piece is damaged, it can impact the game experience of people who are scheduled to play following that game). During game play, I observed the two of them dropping and damaging items in the room, kicking gaming pieces with their feet to move them after they'd dropped them on the floor and walking on top of materials. This is not how many of our participants and visitors play. While it may have appeared that I was ushering them out of the room with the intent of going to lunch; I did not go to lunch (despite the fact that I'm quite sure many other humans do)- I just didn't want to have them play any other games especially not our Gold Rush room which is stocked with many items that are over 110 years old. Regarding the difficulty of the game, while experienced gamers may make it out with time on the clock, there are still a lot of players in our area that have never played a game before and we work to ensure that all gamers escape. Our escape games are different (we note that 'everyone escapes' on our website) and we think that people enjoy the positive experience. While we can't please everyone, we do think preservation of the experience for other players is more important than allowing our games to be damaged for solely two people. While input is always appreciated, as business owners, we weigh out cost and benefit on a regular basis. It was my decision that it was potentially more costly to have the two of them play another game than it was beneficial. As well, if our experience was so bad, I'm not sure why the two of them asked to play another game. "
"Escape room ""Espionage"" by Escape Game Alaska in Juneau",https://worldofescapes.com/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,1,"The game itself was enjoyable, if shorter than we were used to. My sister and I got out with 20 minutes to spare and we looked through every inch of space in the room (which, for anyone that’s done a hard escape room before, is the trademark of an experienced team. You have to go through everything to avoid missing an “obvious” clue). The woman running the show was the reason for the bad review. She had her boyfriend stop in before we entered the room and told him that after she was finished here that they could grab food. She’s allowed to have a personal life, sure, but shooing customers out the door after they beat the game saying she has “a thing to do” is just unprofessional. We told her that we had an interest in doing another game (there were no bookings after us) and she told us that she it was doable with 2 people, but she “would rather not have [us] in that room because *this* (gestures around to the scattered items of the room) can’t happen in that room”...it was extremely rude. Then she went on to complain about how LONG it’s going to take her to clean up and that she’s never seen this level of “disaster” in the room before. The staff was unprofessional and I’ve never felt the need to leave a scathing review for anyone. Ever. Feel free to enjoy the game itself, but don’t get in the way of the employee’s free time..."

The tech in the rooms were also very cool and think those always add a very neat ""wow"" factor! I actually think the Illuminati room was fairly easy compared to the ones we've done in the past. The waiting area is very clean and nicer than most of the other escape rooms I've done. The manager, Stephanie, was very kind and friendly. "

They were diverse, challenging and more importantly a lot of fun to solve. We were constantly busy! There is a staff member monitoring your progress, who gives out hints (unlimited) if you really need them. When we arrived, we were greeted by Stephanie who was really kind, helpful, and super sweet!

After you sign in they brief you on all of the rules and give you the story set up for your room. Then they walk you to your room and its time to escape. Actually ""escape"" is a bit of a misnomer, its not really about escaping, its about solving the puzzle. I didn't feel ""trapped"" and there was nothing scary, which is a good thing for a claustrophobic haunted house baby like me. I don't want to spoil anything about the puzzle but I will say that it was just difficult enough that it never felt overly frustrating and that my wife and I had an absolute blast solving it along with the other couple in our group.

"Escape room ""Chinatown"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-chinatown,0,"Truly a blast! I have only had experience with one escape room before - my office did the whole ""team bonding"" thing. Anywhoo! This time I got a group of friend together and the room/experience by far exceeded the first. A few points to highlight...The room - the room itself was very well done. The decor and space. Something I didn't love about the first escape room was how small and crowded it felt. We did the ""Chinatown"" theme and they did a great job giving a restaurant feel.The clues/ puzzle pieces - what really set this place apart was the clues! Again, comparing it to my last experience, there were far less obvious clues which really made us think and work as a team. More importantly the type of puzzle pieces they engineered were phenomenal and extremely creative. Not to give anything away, but you really have to exercise all options with everything in the room touching, aligning, and pushing. Nothing came too easy with this room! Customer service - the girl who assisted us was polite and sweet. Plus, the few times we did have to ask for hints, she gave us the perfect nudge in the right direction. All in all a great experience. I will defiantly be forming a new team and heading back soon!"
"Escape room ""Chinatown"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-chinatown,1,"Such a great time!  3 of us did the Chinatown Room and it was so much fun! We barely escaped but I think it would have been better if we had a couple more people.  The 3 of us had done a few escape rooms before, but this was by far the most fun. The room was decorated in a way that made you feel like you were really in a restaurant in Chinatown. The owner Greg was also super accommodating as the same afternoon of our reservation we were going to run late. He was really nice and put us in at a later spot, which was still open. He didn't have to do that, so we really appreciate it. Staff was also very nice. The clues were also really helpful when we needed them. Can't wait to come back to do the other rooms!!"

"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,0,This room had the perfect flow and was heavy puzzle-based. Soundtrack was awesome and as you progress through the room it just gets better and better. The last part was probably the best thing ever. It starts off with an FBI kind of vibe and turns into a detective like situation and then you walk into a scary movie right after that. The game master Curtis will give you candy!
"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,1,"Had a really fun timeDid the ""Jack the Ripper"" room and found it to be very historically accurate.

"Escape room ""Jack the Ripper"" by Maze Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/maze-rooms-jack-the-ripper,2,"These rooms are the real deal! Strongly recommended! The Culver City branch let my fiancee and I play their new ""Jack the Ripper"" room early, and good golly, it was amazing. A wide variety of clever puzzles that are integrated with a full, 3-Act narrative. No puzzles exist ""Just because"". They are all either literally riddles/challenges Jack left behind or direct metaphors for the investigative process. Not only are the puzzles thematically enthralling, they are entirely challenging and creative. Each of them is very different than the others while also containing different thought processes. Some are riddles that require abstract thought, whereas another puzzle may be a straight-forward scavenger hunt that requires a keen eye, curiosity, and thorough investigation. My fiancee and I work together well but also have very different thought processes. To this end, it felt entirely rewarding to split up and apply this, with my interpreting coded messages and her noticing the clues and items I would have never caught onto. So rewarding!As well, the room's hosts are beyond kind and generous. We were provided a walkie talkie that was intended to be used for a limited amount of clues, as well as emergencies.  I can't say enough nice things about this room. It's the real deal. Rooms like this are textbook examples of why Escape Rooms are big and what a unique experience they can provide.Please go try it as soon as you can!"

The man who helped us was fun and kind, and we were able to escape the Genie room with 4 minutes to spare. Whew! Challenging but not impossible, that room was perfect for the girls. Note: since the girls were under 16, I had to purchase a ticket and be in the room as well. This was actually a good thing because they needed a bit of help here and there. Thanks so much for a great memory!"
"Escape room ""Genie Ransom"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-genie-ransom,1,"We wanted to try this room for months after randomly driving by. I, finally, had a chance to take my husband as a surprise for his birthday. The owner was so friendly and understanding when we showed up late! (We called first and he was so nice.) The coded door to get in is very fun. The waiting area is on the roof of the building and was genuinely stunning to walk into. We did the Genie room because it was the easiest room and there was only the two of us. We ended up making the Top 10 wall. He offered us a promo for a second room and ended up doing The Enchanted Forest immediately after. The Enchanted Forest is beautiful/creepy ambience and a total immersion experience. I loved this room so much. Even the scary features that I did not want to go near. We didn't make the Top 10 wall in this room but that's okay. We talked to the owner about creating the rooms and he was so personable. I can only say good things about this experience. We will definitely be back to try the other two rooms!"

"Escape room ""Sorcerer’s Sanctum"" by Omescape in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/omescape-richmond-sorcerers-sanctum,2,"I've played all 3 rooms at this location (4 if you count the room they discontinued) and they are all good.  I was not a fan of the pirate / treasure themed room, but thankfully they replaced that with a room called Sorcerer's Sanctum, which is their best room yet.  The second best room is The Penitentiary and Omega is a distant third (but still enjoyable).   I would recommend the following head count for these rooms:Sorcerer's Sanctum: 6-10The Penitentiary: 4-6Room Omega: 3-5Sorcerer's Sanctum is the most satisfying of the rooms as the puzzles are straightforward and logical.  Penitentiary has one or two puzzles that make you roll your eyes when you finally get the answer because they just aren't quite fair.  Omega is a smaller room and probably better for people who are very analytical or math oriented.Overall, you really can't go wrong here.  I think this location has two of my all time favorite rooms and it even better than some of the pricier rooms in SF."

The room was so immersive that I thought I was going to be the next victim of Maneater (the scare actor who played Maneater was absolutely amazing!!). Everyone involved in this room did a phenomenal jobs and scared the daylights out of my whole group. If you have the chance, do Murder Co. Hardcore!

"Escape room ""The Hex Room"" by Cross Roads Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/Cross-Roads-Escape-Games-Hex-Room,0,"LOVED this escape room!!When I first received the invite to come along, I thought okay, what is going to set this one apart from the rest? I've been to my share of escape rooms, some were great, others needed to mature a little more, but after you've done so many, you want to find a uniqueness about the next one.I read the concept of everyone starting off separated into different rooms, that really caught my eye. The idea of everyone being a different character based on a quirky personality test was also nice. I had my eye set on being the detective (which I was able to be ). I watched as my friends became elected into the other positions - the jock, the rebel, the nerd, the virgin and the prom queen.To conquer this escape room, you really need the right dynamic. Everyone has their own puzzles to conquer, but at the same time, one may have something for someone in another room. I don't want to spoil much, but I will speak from being the detective. If you find yourself in this spot, I hope you don't get overwhelmed easy. You are the glue that bonds everyone and it is your responsibility to make sure everyone is okay and gets what they need.I highly recommend this room and will be speaking nothing but good things about it to anyone interested. What a great team at Crossroads, I can't wait to see what rooms you all come up with next."

Cult of Mithras and X-Child (which we broke the records on!) utilized the most creative puzzles, riddles, and devices that our group has encountered in AZ. Some of the secrets in the rooms actually left us with a sense of awe and wonder! I'd say the rooms strike the perfect balance between making you think outside the box and communicate with your team while avoiding frustrating, ridiculously-hard and obscure problems that are impossible to solve. Loved the themes of the rooms as well and can't wait to return for The Cell! These are the best escape rooms in AZ that we've encountered and I would definitely recommend them to anyone!"

"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,0,My group of four did both Fogmore Manor and the bayou rooms. These rooms are done really well! We've done a bunch of escape rooms in San Diego and this one is definitely in our top 3 favorite places.  The tech in these rooms are really awesome! They are very challenging which we like but doable. We got trapped in both rooms but we're about a minute away from solving them so the owner let's us finish. The owner is really passionate about his rooms which is really cool. He designed and programmed everything himself which is very impressive. I wouldn't attempt this room with any less than 4 people because it is challenging. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to do an escape room.
"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,1,"We read somewhere that the Entrapment (Bayou Room) was a Top 5 Escape Room in San Diego so we decided to give it a try. We usually have 5 in our group but were missing our 5th this night. We were a tad skeptical upon arrival as their location shares a main entrance way with a car sales & sketchy massage parlor. It also had a strong smell of pets or the bad smell of a public bathroom. Then their guest waiting room was nothing to brag about when compared to the 20+ other escape rooms we've visited...That's where the negative observations stop. Upon entering The Bayou room, it was well designed/decorated, very interactive, and had a lot of variety involved to keep you interested the entire time! It wasn't a typical escape room where you have to open 20 locks to complete the game. Our game master had to inform us we were doing the right thing but gave hints if say something we're doing wasn't lining up quite right to obtain the desired result but this didn't detract from the overall experience. Teamwork is definitely needed as there's lots to do in there! In the end, it turned out to be a very fun yet challenging experience. Give The Bayou room a try if you want something a little different than you're accustomed to! You won't be disappointed."
"Escape room ""The Bayou: Legend of the Midnight Raven"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-entrapment-the-bayou,2,"I did this room when I was on a trip to San Diego last year.It's the best escape room I've ever done.

Galaxy Quest: more challenging than Krampus. LOVED Cosmo, who gave me as much sass as I gave him. And the little friendly alien, who distracted us for longer than we probably should have been- but he was just so cute! If you like more tech-heavy effects do this one. I recommend at least 3 people if you're just casual escape room fans."
"Escape room ""Galaxy Quest"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-flight-of-the-pandorus,1,"We loved playing Galaxy Quest!!! My 10 year old daughter and I enjoyed the high immersion, the sense of humor, and the sci-fi nature of the room. The puzzles were quirky and fun. I found myself repeating some of the directions because they were useful. It was also important to listen to directions given. We enjoyed ourselves immensely and found we had a lot to do and were fully engaged in either saving the world or destroying it. We did have a couple of tech issues, which honestly, happens in escape rooms in Los Angeles. I've come to expect them, but they didn't take away the joy we had in playing this room. (The only place where we've played escape rooms that have a lot of high tech and did not have any tech issues was in Israel, but the puzzles were not that interesting in the rooms we've played there.) We both enjoyed the puzzles at Galaxy Quest because of the mix and uniqueness.I would highly recommend this room to families of tweens, couples who want to laugh and work together and get to know each other better, and groups of friends looking for a fun, challenging time.There is a parking lot in the back and clean restrooms. The GM and owner, Brian was stellar."

There's a huge free attached parking lot. They have a few different rooms of varying difficulty. We chose the Galaxy Quest room which is by far the hardest room I've ever done. It is very different from many of the other rooms that I've done. 60out is great, and I can't wait to do some of their other rooms."

Now that I've done Sister's Secret, I have to say it's my favorite room I've ever done. Out of 54 rooms, this one was the most immersive I've experienced. Edwin, the owner, has an attention to detail, high quality puzzles, and intriguing story line that all come together perfectly in this room. I was scared, but not to the point where puzzles couldn't be completed. There's just the right amount of cool tech in the room, and it all added to the spooky theme. I'm also a sucker for a story - if you pay attention you will be carried through a movie like storyline from beginning to end. A cool bonus is the lobby has a mini escape room practice game. I highly recommend The Unlockables!"

"Escape room ""Sister's Secret"" by The Unlockables in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/the-unlockables-sisters-secret,2,"Came in on a Saturday afternoon.  My crew and I love escape rooms so this is not our first rodeo.  Place has 3 room, two of them sister secret and the escape are a bit more advanced and technologically involved.  The last one is more of your traditional escape room.  We did sister's secret and it was one of the better escape rooms in terms of atmosphere, challenge and puzzle flow.  For this room you need atleast 3 people and i'd recommend more if some of the people aren't that experienced.  Puzzle complexity is average and they all make sense.  Its perfect for larger groups since it is non-linear (something they tell you at the beginning) so you can all work of different things at the same time.  There are a lot of things to do in this room so its going to be hard if your team doesn't have multiple competent people.The atmosphere of the room is great.  Nice spooky ambience with a few things that go bump in the night.  Really a nice immersive experience with a bunch of fun puzzles."

To start off the staff is very nice and informative if it is your first time, but we didn't need any explaining, so they asked us about our previous experiences doing escape rooms. The puzzles were well thought out and some were elaborate especially from the very beginning, you have to use your head and pay attention to all clues around you. We did use 3 clues to only find out we were already on the right track we just needed reassurance. We escaped with 15 minutes to spare ! They do have one other room at this location called Nautical (remember I'm talking about the one on western). The location might be a little hard to find at first but the sign is on their door. Street parking only, they have meters, or you can park down the side street during certain times around the corner. Highly recommend for a small birthday party, company outing for 6 employees, or even something to do when bored or looking for more things to do in LA aside from the common tourist things ."

I can't wait to go back and try all of the other rooms that are available. The location is creatively decorated, realistic and you really have to see it to believe it. They did a FANTASTIC job designing The Classroom. It's so easy to get lost in its reality and play the game to win. The owners are so friendly and so supportive and the customer service we received makes this our #1 Escape Room! We highly recommend this place for a fun night out with friends or family."

"Escape room ""Gravitational Effect"" by International Room Escape AZ in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-gravitational-effect,2,"Gravitational Effect - I think I liked this room better than Amazon Rainforest. They tried to make the room 4D by giving you 3D glasses to enhance the experience but, let's be honest, they're not going to do anything other than make you trip and/or make the puzzles difficult because you can't see them straight. They are not needed to play the game so they are pretty pointless, in my opinion. We didn't even put them on. For the most part, the puzzles made sense and a few were challenging but not overly difficult. There were a couple of puzzles I felt that if they were improved upon they would make the experience more immersive. One of the puzzles involved ""jackets"" which, at first, we thought were just plastic bags. This made the puzzle seem kinda cheesy because they were just cheap rain ponchos that didn't really fit with the room. Perhaps investing in some actual jackets to make it more themed would help spruce up this puzzle some. The other puzzle was the final puzzle. I don't want to give anything away so I won't say anything about it other than it had absolutely nothing to do with the theme of the room. But even with that being said, I do want to say that there was one ""puzzle"" that was more of a physical challenge and that was a lot of fun. It caught us off guard when we saw it (which is almost always a good thing in the world of escape rooms) and we laughed a lot through it. I thought it was great for them to have this in the room and really added a lot to the experience. "

So we decided to do another room and did Starlight Lounge, but this was only with 6 people. This room was much easier than the first, but still made you think a lot. My tip is to not have everyone work on one thing, split up but communicate with each other very well, no matter which room you decide to do. I believe that 6 is the perfect amount of people to escape. We escaped the second room, breaking the record and becoming second on the leader board! #dinner2go  I will definitely be back to do other rooms!"

I chose this one over the other because the premise seemed more technical and the other room was rated as scary, which was a no-go for one of our members. The puzzles were very technical in nature rather than relying heavily on math or word puzzles, which was a huge positive for the room as it fit the theme and every time we solved one we were blown away with the amount of technology that had to have gone into creating the puzzle. Comparing this to my first escape room experience, this escape was far more satisfying and we all can't stop talking about each puzzle and the creativity behind them. I can't wait to try out future rooms that they have in construction."
"Escape room ""Inception"" by Chronos Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/chronos-escape-room-inception,2,"My sister in law was in town for her birthday and we decided, spur of the moment, to do an escape room. I wanted to do the inception room because it was rated harder than their other room. The puzzles were a fun mix of physical and more traditional. Some of the physical puzzles were difficult for our group, but I expect that if you or someone in your group is more of a spacial thinker then you probably won't have the problems we did.Inception is a rather tech heavy room, which often feels gimmicky to me. However in the Inception room they used the tech to their advantage really well. It fits the theme and feel of the room superbly.Overall, Inception is an excellent room and is one of the few rooms I've done that actually gets better in my mind the more I analyze it."

Even the insights of my six year old (who was sometimes helpful!) did not allow us to 'defuse the bomb and save the world' in time.While frustrating, no game worth playing lets everyone win.

I've been to 5 different companies and this was by far the most engaging! It's not your typical room with some decorations and puzzles, it truly feels like you're in an underground bunker trying to escape what's coming after you.We had 4 people and completed the Chapter 1 experience. The puzzles were creative and challenging. The atmosphere, story, live actors, and overall experience was incredible. We could feel the pressure of trying to escape and the fear of losing. This made the puzzles more difficult and definitely had our hearts racing. We're definitely going back to complete Chapter 2!"

Highly recommend and we'll be back to solve the other rooms soon! Tip for those visiting, 7/10 is not so challenging. My teammates and I have about 5 rooms experience on average and we completed the room in about 25min out of the hour provided.

I went with my girlfriend and four other friends and we had to find our magic wands (we being wizards and all, cursed by an elf...perhaps a Hungarian elf) and find out how to escape the room in one hour.

"Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-the-room-scottsdale-jurassic-escape,0,"We did The Dig and Jurassic Escape. Both werr great! Ive never done these before and was honestly blown away with how smart the puzzles were. The only complaints I have is both were for 10 people ( our party had 5) and it felt like 10 was way too many people. In both rooms it really felt like maybe 4 or 5 clear leaders took the reigns, 3 people helped and at least 2 people were completely useless and either got in the way or stood in the corner probably not enjoying themselves. The rooms really should be capped at 8. Also there should be an option to book a room as adults only or kid friendly. I can see for adults who've paid the money and are really into doing the puzzles, having to let little Timmy unlock the box or push the buttons or have a turn reading clues is just obnoxious and ruins the experience they played for. There should be like Escape the Room Junior for kids (of appropriate age) so that anyone who books that knows what they are signing up for. Likewise, being the only kid in a group where you might mot know everyone in the party is awkward for the kid and really opens up the door to awkwardness if your kid isn't totally well behaved or is competing with random adults to solve a part of the puzzle."

The quality of the room was fantastic. The sound effects, props, etc. I really enjoyed the storyline and found parts to be challenging. We were grouped with 5 other people, as the rooms accommodate groups up to 10. If you prefer to be with people you know, I'd recommend looking into it. The personalities of others you don't know can be overwhelming and squander the experience at times.Our room guide/host would offer assistance at times, but her timing was somewhat frustrating. I understand escaping the room isn't meant to be spoon fed, although timelier guidance would've been appreciated. Overall a fun night out and we'd consider coming back again."

"Escape room ""Playground"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-playground,2,"We found The Escape Game because it was right around the corner from our office, but the experience far surpassed the convenience of the location. We held a team-building event for a group of twelve in the Playground room. The game was highly engaging, fun, and just the right amount of challenging. Our group was twelve people, the maximum for the room. I would recommend a slightly smaller group, because in such a large group, people could disengage.Overall we had a great experience and recommend The Escape Game for small team-building events."

The tasks were arranged such that most of us buddied up to tackle different parts, and we all became very engaged in our separate tracks. So even though we all did the same room, each of us had an individual experience.The effects were really well done, the tasks were a good difficulty level, and each one felt like an accomplishment. Our host(/MC) was very entertaining, gave good hints, and really added to the atmosphere of the place. Not to mention, the story was compelling, creepy, and really engaging.If I could magically forget the clues, I'd be more than willing to do it over."

"Escape room ""Midnight on the Bayou"" by Red Lantern Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/red-lantern-escape-rooms-midnight-on-the-bayou,2,"I was fortunate enough to beta test this game. I was in a group of about 8 players, some of them seasoned, some were new. The waiting room is nice and comfy with a few puzzles to bide your time (and one puzzle which I still am bitter over not solving). The bathroom is well kept and spacious. The staff is really nice and clearly put this room together with a ton of love.The room itself was really cool - very different from the others I've played as the game itself had a full story from beginning to end, and everything you did within the room related directly to the story. The room is very spacious to accommodate larger parties. My friend I went with was really jumpy - she was afraid of being scared and the funniest thing about that is that nothing in it was overtly scary. I've already recommended this game to my aunt for my niece's birthday, as she's always wanted to try an escape room and I can guarantee this is a room she'd enjoy and wouldn't be frightened by.There are some really challenging puzzles and tasks in this, and some that are a little more intuitive to solve. At the end of it, our group had succeeded! Yayyy! I really loved the more detailed plot and the love that was put into this escape room."

The store location is in the middle of Hillcrest, the lobby is decorated so nicely and everything was in good quality. The staff was fun as well.

"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,3,"My husband and a few friends had time this Sunday and we tried out two of the room here. The Science room was definitely challenging. There is a lot of math involved and a LOT more 3-5 number combo locks and some red herrings. The answers to those also involve more math. Thankfully, you get white boards to help keep them straight. The puzzles felt more there to provide a challenge than fitting well in the narrative. Some of the puzzles were clever and unique though and not all are math ones. Overall we liked and had a lot of fun."
"Escape room ""Science"" by Lockdown Escape Rooms in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/lockdown-escape-rooms-science,4,"This is the first room we failed (out of ~13)... We were just one puzzle away. I would recommend doing this room with 3-4 people. Before we even started, they warned us that this room is their most difficult one and they recommend 4 people and that we start off with 6 hints (as opposed to 3 and 4).The moment we stepped into the room, we were overwhelmed by the sight of a surplus of puzzles. We messed up on one of the first puzzles and were stuck on it for very long and the hints we were initially given did not help us solve the actual issue we had until way later. Near the end, we blasted through the remaining puzzles but it wasn't enough to make up for the time we wasted with the initial puzzle. They do provide white boards with working board pens but it's still difficult to remember different qualities, move to a different location, solve the puzzle, then move to a different location to actually open a lock. The room just felt like a room filled with a bunch of harder puzzles with no real story that connects the puzzles."

There were also some cool surprises to be found.  My only complaint with the experience was being paired in the room with strangers.  It makes the experience less enjoyable when you are solving puzzles with people you don't know and when their style of working is different than yours.  They had been drinking and were loud and cursing a bit, to each their own,  just not what I enjoy being around. Overall the experience was good, but it would have been so much better had it just been our group alone in there. "

I had done one other ""escape room"" before at a different company but was very disappointed that it was just a boring room with random puzzles scattered about. Boss Play's room actually felt like a real room we had to escape with thoughtful puzzles that fit the theme. There were also a few surprises that blew my mind when we discovered them.

I was fortunate to try their new Chocolate Factory (already did their Prohibition room), and it was one of the most creative themed rooms I have seen.Jeremy, the owner, has done something that few escape room owners can say, which is that he built his rooms using no locks and keys. Therefore, you aren't looking for padlocks or combination locks to open, only to find another locked box. The electronics he uses for opening doors, solving riddles and special effects are second to none.Anyone in North County who hasn't done an escape room before, come to Boss Play first and try their Chocolate Factory room. It will set the standard to which you will compare all other future escape rooms you go to. For those who have already done escape rooms, Boss play is worth the trip."

I went with a group of five and had an excellent time. The items you find might not be useful right when you find them but everything has a place in the story, I promise! They put a lot of thought into the storyline and the room definitely corresponds with the narrative they give. I found myself thinking, ""Granny is such a hoot!"" The end of this room is really fun."

"Escape room ""Cursed Crypt"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-cursed-crypt,0,"Cursed Crypt, my 3rd room at Escape Hotel, is a solid showing from a severely under-rated location.  Formerly the Tomb Raider room which displaced Sanatorium, your group is given the challenge of finding the final piece to an ancient artifact.  You start in a mausoleum that could have been straight out of the film itself.  The transitions between rooms was a little odd; mausoleum to a study to a boat to a temple but the production of those ""roomscapes"" was up there with the best.  Blaring sirens, wind and rain, lightning and thunder, the hum of the boats engine, the whole experience was flooded with immersive lights and sounds.  There was moderate amount of scavenging and tasking but overall, the puzzles were engaging and well tied to the theme.  The hosts in the lobby were friendly and professional but this room in particular, though, suffers from a lack of support.  For as much as these rooms cost, there really is no excuse for inattentive GMs.  Hints were generally ""keep doing what you're doing"", ""look harder"", or for something we had already finished.  And we escaped into an empty corridor with no GM to greet us.  Combined with the poor quality walkie-talkies and loud sounds I mentioned earlier made communication that much more frustrating.  But hint system and GMs aside, Cursed Crypt still comes out strong and ranks 42nd out of 129 rooms I've done so far.  Highly recommended for fans of deeply immersive rooms!"
"Escape room ""Cursed Crypt"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-cursed-crypt,1,"I've been here so many times and i love coming every single time! The first time I came, I walked in pleasantly surprised by just the lobby because of how it was decorated. It's meant to give you the creeps and they do a great job of doing that from the start. All of the employees are so funny too! You can tell they have a lot of fun with their job and they're not afraid to joke around with guests. I decided to bring some friends who were still pretty new to escape rooms and when they went to the restroom, someone went over the intercom whispering their names (and duh I loved that). Out of the rooms they have, I've done Cocaine, Circus, Escape Room Movie, Slaughtered, Cursed Crypt, and Espionage. All of them did a great job of making the group feel immersed and it was always a challenge. I'm absolutely coming back to try and finish the rest and whatever else they come out with!!"

The escape room is really well-designed to match the theme, and the puzzles are also related to the theme.This is not a simple ""find the key"" and unlock the lock room. You actually have to use your brain for some of these puzzles. And the unique part of this room is that you're separated from half of your team to start (and you have to work with them to find a way to get together and complete the challenge.Well done! I highly recommend this room!"
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Challenge"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-da-vincis-challenge,4,We had a blast doing DaVinci's Challenge at Quest Room.

"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Basement"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-basement,0,"We escaped from the Basement. Twelve of us. It was exhilarating. We had previously done the Boiler Room. Even though we missed escaping it was still great fun (We subsequently went back and conquered it). The Boiler Room puzzles are sequential; you have to solve puzzle 1 to get to 2 ... The Basement is more of a free-for-all. We went as six couples who were friends; I think it might not be as fun to do with strangers. Not that there's anything wrong with strangers. A tip that we figured out after the fact: Designate one person to be the master of all the clues, etc. That way everything will be kept track of and there won't be a lot of redundant effort. Good luck!"
"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Basement"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-basement,1,"The Basement was my first ever escape room experience, and I can say it was one of the most amazing things I have ever experienced let alone in Los Angeles.They have made an amazing back story and theme for the entire attraction. My group tried both of the rooms they offer - the Basement and the Boiler Room. We failed both but came within seconds of solving the Boiler Room! The rooms are definitely far from an easy ride which just adds to their attraction. As of writing they are opening a third room next month which will be their longest yet - I am so excited to try it out next time I go to LA!The atmosphere, puzzles and employees make this an unmissable thing to do - you won't be disappointed no matter what kind of person you are. The whole thing is extremely innovative and for replay value they even have three different versions of the Basement which changes things up enough to essentially make it a new game. When they open the third room this means that you could easily visit at least 5 times, and I am sure they will look into adding different versions of the Boiler Room and third room in the future as long as they show continued popularity."

"Escape room ""Chapter 1: The Basement"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-basement,3,"I've been in a few escape rooms now and I always have fun. The Basement was probably the most atmospheric room I've been in and I'll definitely be going back to do the Boiler Room and the Study.The price is a little high at $35 for 45 minutes but as a one off experience I can accept that. The one issue I had is that I booked with a group of 4 but we were then put in with another group of 6, without being told. I understand the company want to maximize their profit but I feel the more people in the room, the less you each experience and so I would have liked to have been notified before hand."

We failed to escape the basement but we are determined to not end up in Edward Tandy's freezer again! A lot of thought and detail went into making this experience very realistic. The props, art work and noises really make you feel like your trapped in a mad man's basement. I brought my gf, who is a big horror movie fan, for her bday and she loved it! She spent the first five minutes of the experience checking out how well the room was decorated. I had to remind her that we were on a time limit and had to start looking for clues to get out. If you haven't tried it yet, I definitely recommend this place."

"Escape room ""The Great Redemption"" by Famous Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-great-redemption,5,A very clever room with several twists on puzzles. Good use of red herrings. Enough puzzles to keep a group of six busy. Wish there were a few more as we escaped with about 10 min to spare. I enjoy getting to the last few minutes with the adrenaline pumping. Would be interested on returning if they had additional rooms.
"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,0,"We were able to find an open game slot the day of for a group of 6, awesome.  We did Pacific Rim, very cool!!  I personally think it helps to have seen the movie so you get the objective and some of the team requirements (like drifting).  Our group was 6 adults, 4 kids (10-13).  This was my second escape room, and I thought it was a really hard one.  There are a lot of mental puzzles, my kids had a hard time deciphering those.  They did have some physical challenges they could do, but they were out matched with this game, in my opinion.  They advised no less than 13 and I believe that is good advice.  Our MC was perfect, he helped just enough to keep it fun (versus really frustrating) but didn't give anything away, it was still a lot of hard work!  We didn't save the world, but our group still had a really great time!"
"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,1,Awesome first escape room experience! We did the Pacific Rim themed one and you definitely don't need to have seen the movie to participate. We didn't escape but we got really close. If we had about 15 more minutes we would've been okay but I'd say that's a win for the majority of our group being inexperienced with escape rooms. I don't want to spoil any of the layout or specifics but staff was super accommodating and helpful. Definitely recommend!
"Escape room ""Pacific Rim: Shatterdome Defenders"" by Real Escape Game in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/real-escape-game-scrap-pacific-rim,2,"Looking for a fun activity to do as a family with our two teenage kids (13 & 16), we thought we'd give this a try. We chose the Pacific Rim game as it had an element of technology for our digital natives. It was lots of fun and time flew by. Our game host let us sweat just the right amount, but helped us along the way with a few clues when needed. Not only was it lots of fun and kept us on our toes the whole time, but it was really nice to see the family come together, each one taking on different roles naturally. It gave for a fun conversation afterward too on what we learned and how we can do things differently when we try another one, because we definitely will."
"Escape room ""The Collector"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-the-collector,0,"My friends wanted to do a girls night here. When you book the room, you have the option of booking it individually for that room. When we arrived, I guess someone else also booked the room, so he joined our girls night. lol. So there was a total of 5 of us. We ended up doing the Collector room. We were definitely advised that it was a very difficult room, which they were definitely right about that. You have to figure out a lot of combinations to open some locks. There is also some math involved, so bring someone who is good at math. I think it was a fun experience, the only thing I didn't like is if you ask for a clue then they take some time off of your clock. I've been to two other Escape rooms and I've never heard of that. They give you pretty good hints, so I don't think you'll need the clues, however we still did. lol. We were able to make it out with 4 minutes to spare!"
"Escape room ""The Collector"" by Paradox Escape Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/paradox-escape-room-the-collector,1,"This is the first time we have been to this particular escape room, and we chose to do The Collector room. It was definitely a challenging one, but it was worth trying to do. I've been to other escape rooms, and this one is a little different when it comes to hints. The first hint will cost you 1 minute, the 2nd one 3 minutes, and the third one 5 minutes. They had a television in the room with the timer, and this particular room had some higher-tech type puzzles. We had a good time there and would definitely go back to try the other rooms.

We were the first group to try this room(literally finished the room two minutes before we showed up) and although we did not make it, the two guys running the room were very helpful with guiding us.

But, I'm glad I didn't let that stop us from checking it out. We had a blast! The puzzles are challenging but not frustratingly so and the overall concept is so unique and creative, we wish there were a ton more like it.

"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,0,This was my first escape room and it was awesome! Great team-building exercise. Keep it up guys! Can't wait to do another one!
"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,1,"The Cranial CarnivalBrought a large group of co-workers out to Escapedom, so large that we had to split up and did all 3 of their rooms.  My group went through Cranial Carnival so this review will be about that room specifically.  The idea is that you have to enter a boy's mind and lock up bad memories that have traumatized him and put him into a coma.  Not the most believable of premises but fine.  I'll roll with it.After explaining the backstory, the GM walked us to the ""brain"" door and in we went.  I thought the entrance into the room was a little disappointing and could have been much more creative an in-line with the story (traveling down a dark passage way, a red slide), really anything more than just a doorway.   The production in the first room was decent but really felt like a square room filled with puzzles.  Other than the occasional pink squiggles on the wall, there was nothing really organic about it.  With a couple of exceptions, the puzzles seemed to mirror the memories that the boy had experienced at the circus.  A healthy dose of scavenging kicked off the room and we wasted time looking through the non-linear puzzles that are unsolvable until you finish the scavenger hunt.  One magnet/coin maze was a difficult frustrating time sync and we had some tech issues with an 8-sided polyhedron puzzle and one ""locked"" door was open.  That was room 1.  Room 2 was a mixed bag of some clever puzzles, some not so clever puzzles (light clock), and some downright frustrating tasks (fishing).  In hindsight, it was the tech issues that did us in and we came up about 2 minutes short of escaping.  Not the best, not the worst room, I've done and comes in at #112 out of 168 rooms I've done to date."
"Escape room ""The Cranial Carnival"" by Escapedom in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escapedom-the-cranial-carnival,2,"Just successfully escaped from Cranial Carnival, the newest of Escapedom’s rooms. Like their first two rooms, production quality was great, the puzzles were unique, and the puzzles weren’t all linear so it was ideal for our large group of eleven. A lot of great “aha” moments. Chase was a great game master! Definitely recommend this room to newbies as well as experienced players. Thanks for another awesome room, Escapedom! 😊"

"Escape room ""Space Bus"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-space-bus,0,"Booked Space Bus after playing the King Arthur game and it was worth it. To start with it is a GORGEOUS game. I played a few sci-fi themed escape games around the world and this one is the best one yet. The deep rumble of engines and a little bit of movement made it so real! The game puzzles are well done and games allow for many things to be done at the same time. Also, some puzzles could be solved in more than one way. Be sure not to overcomplicate, because in many cases the solution is simpler than you think. "
"Escape room ""Space Bus"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-space-bus,1,"Space Bus was great! I've never done an escape room so I had no expectations. The staff we interacted with were very friendly. The condition of the bus was excellent, quite new. The level of technology in the bus in regard to the puzzles was also unexpected. I thought the experience would comprise of shaking curtains for hidden keys or looking under loose tile and the like, haha. To finish the bus on time with the amount of puzzles, you should definitely have at least 4 participants.My 5 friends and I did not set any records but we finished with exactly 1 minute to spare! Oh, the drama!"

The staff quickly separated the large group into 3 teams and set us on our way.  Preliminary instructions were quick, to the point, and off we were.  I was blessed with the Space Bus, a super detailed designed ""school bus"" outside of the facility.  At first I looked at he exterior and thought ""huh"", but once inside and locked it, the lights, sounds, and feeling of immersion was immediate.  And damn we're the puzzles cool and challenging.  No spoilers here, except we got maybe 4 hints, and finished the experience with 3 minutes to spare.  CANNOT WAIT FOR ANOTHER ROOM!  Definitely will be back.  Great job!"

Our guide Will was fantastic and actually recommended some escape rooms in Los Angeles (where we went next).Actual tips:  Listen during the guide's introduction -- it'll be important.  Read everything (even more important).  Assign the math-y puzzles to the Kumon lovers on your team."

The first puzzle was so fun and it perfectly set the mood for the rest of the room. Some puzzles were high tech and involved things I had never seen before.

I have done two escape rooms there now. The first was the zombie lab which while fun, was only okay. The second was this one, and I thought it was amazing! We escaped with 5 minutes left. Some of the clues were really difficult and without a hint, we wouldn’t have solved. Somehow, we figured most of it out ourselves. We had so much fun and will definitely come back. This escape room is very nice despite the surroundings looking a bit sketchy (aka the strip club across the street) I would definitely highly recommend this escape room to anyone who enjoys a good time.

Soon as we walked in the art and different crafts caught your attention, for some reason it reminded me of a tattoo parlor, haha. But we came for a birthday party and we had a good-sized group, my group chose the Cuban Crisis as our mission. You basically have 60 mins to find clues and crack the codes to finally receive the code to unlock the door.

First we started with the hangover. Hard but not too hard. It is for 7 people so if you do not have 7 they will fill in the spaces. Something the website didn’t explain clearly. However, we had a great couple that played the game with us and we had a wonderful time. Then we switched to the VR side. I do have to mention it is not in the same building. So do not book these too close together. We did the ocean Osiris. It was fantastic!!!! The staff helps you so you dont feel lost. We ended our night with the hospital horror. This is not an escape room, it was an “experience”. I was so submerged in my experience that I,... kind of forgot it wasn’t real. I screamed and took off my headset. My greatest fear was in that room and it felt too real to deal with it lol when I tapped out the staff was right by my side with smiles. They made me feel comfortable and supported. I came we’re with my husband and 2 older teens. We ABSOLUTELY recommend his location to EVERYONE."

"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,0,this escape room is HORRIBLE. I have no idea what game others are playing but let me tell you about it without giving the room away. For starters the clues and puzzles make zero sense. It's supposed to themed as a magicians lair but instead it is filled with gibberish as in made up words and symbols and nothing even remotely related to magic. also there is no roof to the room so it feels like you are playing in a small cubical. you can literally hear what is going on in the room right next you to clear as day also THERE IS NO AC so it was super hot in there as well. also the hints that they give you aren't relevant to what you are trying to do. I regret paying my money to go there so PLEASE BOOK ELSEWHERE
"Escape room ""Magician's Library"" by Skeleton Key Rooms in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/skeleton-key-rooms-magicians-library,1,"What a great experience! It was quite challenging for just 4 people, but we finished with just under two minutes left! An hour really flies by when your solving multiple puzzles. The puzzles were intricate and entertaining, and force you to pay attention to small details! Owner came in after we finished and she was really sweet, we stayed and talked with her for quite awhile! Glad to help support a local family who genuinely wants their guests to enjoy the game! Will DEFINITELY visit again!"

"Escape room ""The Society"" by Escape Oakland in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escape-oakland-the-society,0,"WOW. I have to say this placed has really stepped it up with their new room! If you haven't I highly recommend the Society room especially if you are new to escape rooms. As someone who has done over 50, this room is very solid.It's a nice room with several varieties of puzzles throughout.  None felt too hard or poorly designed. I played the room with 2 others and it felt very comfortable and nothing felt impossible. Everything went at a smooth pace. We were all experienced, so we all took our time and didn't feel the urge to rush. With that said we still had a out 5 minutes remaining.There were some locks here and there, but it also had its fair share of electronic puzzles as well. (Thankfully nothing glitched). I highly recommend this room if you are a beginner to escape rooms because it contains the basics that most rooms give to you throughout the country.  And if you are an expert still play it because you can't go wrong.The lobby is nice and the staff is nice as well, but overall if you have played a game here before.... YOU NEED TO COME BACK and play Society because this hands down is the best room here. That's a fact. Not an opinion."

"Escape room ""Amnesia"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-amnesia,0,"We had a great time doing both the Amnesia and Resurrection rooms. Our wonderful game master Jasmine was enthusiastic and supportive. This Quest Room location is in the South Bay Galleria, so there is ample parking, lighting, and places to eat nearby.  We have done all the other rooms by this company and these rooms have the amazing build quality, story elements, and immersion of those rooms plus an added live actor element.  The actor provides some creepy and funny moments, and helps move the gameplay and story forward.  The structure and design of the game promotes collaboration. There is hardly a moment where you feel like you are alone solving a random puzzle and then reporting back to your group. The suspense and thrill are maximized when everyone is present when there is a scary reveal or jump scare. I never heard ""What happened?"" or ""What did you see?"" We all experienced the awesomeness together.  For those apprehensive to do these rooms because of the ""horror"" element, you will be ok. These rooms have plenty of humorous and engaging moments that perfectly balance out the fear factor.  So take a deep breath and enjoy!"

The way it starts out is super different and makes you think more practical than other escape rooms (I work at one so I LOVE playing others and seeing what works and what doesn't) this one works!! Great staff and AMAZING tech. 10/10 recommend! Our actor Jasmine was great, our game master Matt was also really awesome! I'm hoping to get to see him act in the future. And Katey(Katie?) was one of the nicest bubbliest people I've ever met. Just an overall mind blowing and fun experience. (You May even get some free candy )"

"Escape room ""Daycare"" by Escape Hotel in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-hotel-daycare,4,"The experience was really fun! When you walk up, the employees are all in character as you ""check in"" - the check in process is lengthy, so definitely get there as early as they recommend! They need you to fill out waivers and have your photo taken for a fake passport, which you get to keep (and they stamp if you successfully get out of your room). We did the Daycare room, and it was surprisingly tough, but we got out with 12 minutes remaining. We had fun and would do it again."

The website was really simple to navigate and we received a confirmation email with all of the details we needed. Once we arrived at the building, we were greeted by our host with a friendly smile and really hyped us up for what was about to come. After all of the rules and backstory, we were then led to our room. The room had a bit of a National Treasure feel and there was a lot of character to the room. The puzzles were well thought out and it really made us rack our brains trying to get everything solved. We did have to use our two hints to escape but the whole adventure was just a great experience all together and we escape with only a minute to spare.

Today we all happen to have a few hours to kill, so we called up Enigma because we've been dying to try it out. Not only was the staff incredibly friendly, but there was also parking (which is a huge plus)!We got there, they greeted us at the top of the stairs very nicely, we were told a little of what to expect, then we waited about 30 seconds and someone came out, and we got started.

Both rooms had great set designs, ambiance, and the puzzles were creative and, excluding one that I just wasn't getting for a bit, just the right side of difficult but achievable. I want to also praise the staff, they were all friendly and funny and each had their own unique style that I think really brings an air of friendliness to the business that you don't see in a lot of escape rooms. They clearly care about you having a good time. If you're looking for something to do I really recommend giving these rooms a try, where else can you find yourself in the hold of a ship, a zen garden, search for a magical creature, and help save a city in one day?

"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,1,"Took my 8 year old niece here and we had SO much fun. We did the easiest room (the red giant)and it was just the right amount of challenging for the adults and some simple things that she was able to do. Honestly, she probably figured out more than the adults (she's a smarty like that). It was great for her because it was so interactive and hands on. We've been to many rooms that are just a bunch of locks and keys and that's not what this one was. Props and statues put in the right place would activate a movement. It was well done!! The man at the beginning was great at getting my niece excited. He explained so sweetly about the game and made it sound so fun that she was confident and ready to conquer. That intro made it!"
"Escape room ""Red Giant"" by Quest Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/quest-room-red-giant,2,"This review is for Red Giant only.""Red Giant"" refers to a ruby in a crypt, not the planet, so leave your space helmets at home.Parking here is super convenient in the back of the building, but the driveway leading to the parking lot is FILLED with potholes, and when we went there, a giant pond was formed b/c of the rain. There is a ring doorbell and the words ""QUEST ROOM"" in red next to the door. It looks super sketch back there.But once you ring the bell and enter, it is NICE inside. It's obvious that they put a lot of effort in building and maintaining the place. The room itself is VERY well thought out, from where they orient you, to the hints, to the final puzzle. We only needed two hints. The first hint we needed because we weren't patient enough, and the second hint we needed because we weren't as observant when we first entered the tomb as we should have been. There were a couple of times when we received unsolicited hints because we weren't on the right track, which was really nice of them.All in all, I LOVED how this room was designed. Everything really fit well. If I were to change anything, it would be to minimize the Many pages of text in this one book. It's fun, but the book was filled with red herrings, which you don't realize are red herrings until you get to the end and the book explicitly explains which pages are important. I highly recommend this room!"

We have done rooms at 2 of the other Maze Room locations and this one is BY FAR the best!!! The rooms are creative, the puzzles are clever and the staff is fantastic. On Sunday, John made They're Coming a great experience. He gave us tips when we needed but held back when we thought we could figure it out. And when he wasn't sure, he asked! Great concept. (At times I feel like game masters give unwanted help - over-enthusiasm, which I understand, but can be a bit frustrating/annoying.) John was very friendly, positive and genuinely excited for us. He definitely added to the zombie escaping experience. I wish I could say we'd be back, but they need to make a new room first. Please do!"

When it was time to get puzzling, Matthew the Butler came to fetch us and give us the lowdown. We didn't escape, but we were so close it made my heart hurt. Regardless, we had a spectacular time and it was well worth it! When they change it up, we absolutely will be back for more."

"Escape room ""Spellbound"" by Enchanted Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/enchanted-escape-room-spellbound,2,"We did the Spellbound room and liked a lot of things about it.  The decor/ambiance is really good and the puzzles are both fun and challenging.  It is different than other escape rooms that I've done in the past in that there are several objectives you are trying to complete, it's not the typical solving one puzzle leads to the next, leads to the next until you're free.  Because of the way it is structured, doing it with strangers is fine because they can be working on one puzzle while you work on another and if they find a clue for you or you find one of theirs you can share information, but multiple objectives can be getting done at the same time.  It was easy to get tickets and book through their online system and the guy who co-owns it was really nice and helpful. The building they chose for the location is great because it is on a rooftop and there is EASY parking in the back."

"Escape room ""Escape the Time Machine 2"" by Codebreakers in Oceanside",https://worldofescapes.com/oceanside/quests/codebreakers-escape-the-time-machine,1,"The very first escape room my wife and I have ever done. Playing the ""Time-Machine"" room with just the two of us was challenging. The puzzles are easy enough to get you really going. Some puzzles within the game may seem to be overwhelming, but keep trying. Ask for help when you are really stuck. Their clues are not that vague to where it is confusing.A great place to have friends and family enjoy their time and co-workers to build teamwork!

Corrine, the owner, was extremely kind, genuine, personal, helpful, and reassuring, and her passion truly shined through in the conversations we had with her. The diner room's theming was super cute, the backstory was quite a bit of fun, and the technology associated within added a layer of fun interactivity. Each puzzle was exciting and fun, and it all seemed to flow together smoothy.

We are so happy we went! The three games were all great. The Lab is a great intro room - tweens/teens would like it as would rookie escapers. We did AI and it was also fun. Villain’s Lair ended up being our favorite despite us not getting out (20 more seconds, so close!!). Sabrina was great as our game master and is definitely an asset to the company. Definitely check this place out if you like good and intuitive rooms with great scenery."

I thought this one was awesome! We did the villains lair (escaping a North Korean jail) that has a 23% pass rate. Our host was super nice in getting us set up and explaining things. Id recommend for sure and would be back!"
"Escape room ""The Villain's Lair"" by Exit Game in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/exit-game-sd-the-villains-lair,2,"Did both the newest Villain's Lair and the AI escape rooms here. I thought the AI room was more of a room that was rated 4, and the Villain's Lair a 4.5.Both rooms were extremely different, but very engaging. My group of six with varied levels of experience had a lot of fun trying to figure out the puzzles which required some thinking out of the box for both rooms and a lot of running around.I'd recommend at least a group of four for Villain's Lair and no less than four. I think we benefited from having six people because for both AI and Villain's Lair there were a couple puzzles that definitely helped having more people, not less, which is the opposite of what I find for most escape rooms. (I find 4 to be the perfect number). Having spent a lot of time surveying other escapers to find out what rooms would work for a larger group, we settled on Exit Game, and I'm glad we did! Escaping in time definitely relied on teamwork!For Villain's Lair there was a greater level of detail put into the room than in AI, and a lot less button pushing. However, there is one puzzle in Villain's Lair that requires a lot more abstract thinking and may or may not take your group longer to figure out. When we went, the ""alarm"" was speeding up which made a couple of us think we had lost and didn't escape when we still had 7 minutes left when we escaped! Since it was new to the San Diego space, we figured it was expected that they would still have issues and gave them feedback.For AI the details of the rooms were a lot less immersive than Villain's Lair, and I felt most of the puzzles required button pushing. I liked the use of technology and the use of a computer. A few of the puzzles really forced ourselves to think outside of the box. Once you have ""escaped"" you can choose to do hard mode, which our group chose to do.Villain's Lair we were told was a mix of traditional locks and technology (a mix of AI and The Lab basically), of which our group enjoyed more personally. AI is more technology and have no real locks that I can think of, and The Lab which we haven't done is more a traditional lock type room.I really liked our game master, who gave us appropriate clues without revealing too much, just the way we like it, via walkie talkies for both rooms.I'd definitely add Exit Games as one of the top Escape Room companies in San Diego. My group will be back to do their last room, The Lab."

Also, I spoke with a female staff member over the phone regarding a question I had, and she was very helpful in helping me find an answer.

The staff was super friendly and helpful. Allison was super sweet and very patient with us since it was only our second time doing an escape room. We loved the first room so much (Jesters Revenge) that we decided to do the second room (Treasure of the Nation) that same night and what's great is that if you do a second ro that same day, they will give you 20% off!"

"Escape room ""Jester's Revenge"" by No. 1 Escapes in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/no-1-escapes-jesters-revenge,4,"We did the Jester’s Revenge. This was probably the best escape room I’ve done. The people who designed it created fun, challenging, and unique puzzles. I thought the design was well laid out and you had to work together with your other teammates to figure out the solutions. All of the employees were so friendly and kind. We spoke to Brandon on the phone and he warmly explained everything to us in detail. Then we had a friendly woman who set us up acted as our jester. She made the experience even more fun. I was very impressed and I’m so looking forward to trying their other room!"
"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Westgate in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-westgate-the-lost-tomb,0,It was a wonderful time for first timers to the Escape Room experience. Highly recommend. The staff was fantastic.
"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Westgate in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-westgate-the-lost-tomb,1,"I just completed their Lost Tomb escape room and it is easily one of the best escape rooms of the 30-40 I've ever done. It was almost like walking onto the set of Legends of the Hidden Temple. It really sold the atmosphere of being inside a temple, and aside from a bit of a very minor frustration with one specific searching puzzle I had no real issues of note. I will definitely be back for their Bill and Ted and Terminator rooms and will be recommending them to all my friends who like escape rooms. If you are looking for a really well done room I recommend Escape Westgate, you'll have a fantastic time. Plus one the owners look like Michael Douglas so that a bonus!"

"Escape room ""The Lost Tomb"" by Escape Westgate in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-westgate-the-lost-tomb,3,"Went here on a field trip with daughter and class and we did the lost tomb escape room which was really cool , It has multiple rooms and definitely a lot of intricate clues you need to solve . It was a little difficult but with 10 of us we were able to get through it with 20 minutes left which was pretty quick. This is definitely good for kids and adults , great props and design put into this . Can't wait to try the terminator room next ."

It was our first time for all of us, so we had no idea what to expect. Little did I know the Prohibition room was the more difficult of the two - so we didn't make it out before the 60 mins. We had a great time though and felt very proud of ourselves for getting as far as we did. Our host was very generous with the hints, since we kept running around the room asking questions. Very fun, will do again but with a bigger group. Thanks!"

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,0,Did the prison break. Very nicely set up. Mechanics are incredibly creative. Coming back next week to try the others.
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,1,"Our group of 8 did the Prison Break escape room and succeeded in escaping in their hardest room. Some of us consider ourselves useless in escape rooms but we had a good time. While there were a lot of puzzles and hidden objects to solve, the game is as hard as you want to make it because a lot of clues are given even if you don't ask for them. If you want to make the game harder, probably tell the game keeper that you do not want clues given unless you ask. Overall would recommend if you are wanting to be challenged but not so much so that you feel like you have no chance of escaping. Paris was our game keeper and she was definitely keeping an eye out for us and letting us know what illegal things we were doing (like climbing...) and giving us relevant clues. Wish there was more of a celebration after the game like having signs to hold up for pictures."
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,2,"My boyfriend and I walked past the location in SF and we were greeted by a very friendly worker who explained everything to us!

"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,3,It was most amazing experience!! We did the Prison Break escape room as a family. We were joined by another family. Right from the get go the immersive experience began with a very well done setup. Teamwork and communication is very important and we were lucky to have a great dynamic going.The puzzles were fairly challenging but the thrill of cracking the clues was exhilarating. The solutions didn't cease to surprise.The team at the Escape Games is phenomenal! Very personable and super nice. Would especially like to mention Emily and Jackie who helped out tonight.Highly recommend this place to families - my daughter (7.5 years old) is hooked!
"Escape room ""Prison Break"" by The Escape Game San Francisco in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/the-escape-game-san-francisco-prison-break,4,This place is so nice and inviting that my friends and I will keep going till we finish all the rooms.  We just finished the prison break room and it was so amazing and immersive.  What was so great was that Jeff and gurion were so accommodating to one of our teammates being late.  It was great having the full time and for them to allow us to wait and do the room together.  We are definitely coming back to do every room and finish them all.  Best kind of service and such intuitive rooms.

My hubby and I used a terrific LivingSocial deal that made it very affordable. Best date night ever! We combined with two smaller groups to make one large team.

We went with a younger group (ages 9-11) and the gentleman that worked there was awesome. When he saw the girls struggling he would give them a little hint to help them along. Definitely will be doing this again. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it, it's a unique, creative experience.Thanks for everything Escapism"
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,3,Great escape room! It was our group's first room and we all had lots of fun.

"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,4,"Well, how can I not give it 5 stars when we beat the room time record! This was not my first escape room, and I'd say it's right up there with my favorites. Good series of challenges that are thought-inducing and challenging, but not too impossibly hard that you just get frustrated. It's well organized and professionally run. The art gallery theme plays nicely into the challenges too. Definitely recommend."
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,5,"I've done a few of these escape/puzzle rooms, and Escapism is by far the best one.  It is challenging and fun.  You do have the option to ask for clues, which we tried not to do.  This is a great activity for a group of close friends.  I DO NOT recommend this activity for couples who are just dating. This game can get rough and a bit physical since a lot of the clue will require you to get on your knees (not a clue).  A group of 8 might be too much energy and too confusing.  A group of 4-6 is good."
"Escape room ""Gallery 3919"" by Escapism in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/escapismsd-gallery,6,"Awesome experience! Super friendly staff, all of whom were very helpful.  Our group of 8 decided to try out this escape room and were greatly pleased.  We did the Art Museum escape room, and there was a great number of puzzles for our group to solve.  There were a number of very innovative and unique puzzles, and it also had a good number of creepy, twists and turns (although nothing scary)!  I would love to explain more, but I don't want to give anything away.We had to use one hint, but we made it out with 15 minutes to spare.  Definitely looking forward to trying their next room."

My friend and I did the Zombie themed room, and believe me when I tell you this room is not easy at all, but fun once you figure out the clues and you progress through the puzzles. Didn't make it out in time as we had 2 puzzles left, but it only makes us wanna come back and try another room. The teammate Rebecca was awesome! She was very friendly and you could tell she loves her job! We'll definitely come back because she insists that Daycare will give us an experience we won't forget. Thanks Escape Hotel and Rebecca!"

"Escape room ""Ghost Hunters"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-ghost-hunters,0,This was my family's first time doing an escape room.  The host couldn't have been much nicer.  He was friendly and inviting.  The ambiance was warm.  They have lockers so you can store your personal belongings while you are in the escape room.  Puzzle are fun.  Even the easier riddles/puzzles can be challenging when out under pressure.  You are given an hour to escape the room.  Definitely coming back to try the other themed rooms.
"Escape room ""Ghost Hunters"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-ghost-hunters,1,"I've been to all the rooms here! I've also been to many escape rooms but I think some of the escape rooms here have been my favorite. You definitely have to work fast and open minded. The only room we did not pass was a very new one, paranormal, which was too difficult. I would recommend them to have a beta testing period and have the prices of the room be even cheaper so they can figure out what works best for the room. Overall, my friend and I always have a blast here and feel accomplished after beating the rooms...which cannot be said for most other places! We are team #blackhat, remember it!"
"Escape room ""Ghost Hunters"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-ghost-hunters,2,"I've been here twice for the Doll House and Ghost Hunters rooms. Both were challenging but very fair. The puzzles sometimes require thinking out of the box but nothing too complicated. The games were slightly spooky but as they state, they are family friendly and their purpose is not to scare you so no jump scares or anything. The workers are extremely friendly and helpful.I would totally recommend this to anyone!"

Our host, Carl helped make our escape one of a kind. He was incredibly accommodating and informative throughout the entire process. Alan gave us a helpful intro tutorial and answered all of the (many) questions we had. The facility was clean and the room & the props in it were realistic. The difficulty level was undoubtedly enough to keep us fully engaged and with Carl's monitoring, we never felt discouraged. We loved it so much we booked the other Professor Ransom PhD room for tomorrow. I would highly recommend checking out the Great Escape Maricopa!"

Our little group of four smarty-pants.... rather, three smarty-pants and one very short but enthusiastic cheerleader (that would be me by the way), had a blast in The Elevator scenario which was perfect for a group of four!  The puzzles were challenging and fun.  The environment was themed so well!  They even had elevator music playing as we worked our way around each dilemma.  We escaped in time, and made the leader board for about 5 minutes as I'm sure other teams have beaten that record by now.  Still, we were proud of it and it was such a fantastic experience for our friends visiting from Oregon!The service was wonderful and the young lady who helped us (she told us her name a few times but I have the memory of a goldfish) was utterly helpful and delightful to talk to.  A young man also game out to greet us, who very much seemed like he was very knowledgeable about the rooms.  Anyway, I digress.  Exodus is fantastic.  And it's located right by an In-N-Out if all that thinking got you hungry."

Last one we did was submarine which was a little bit frustrating but other than that it was good. Favorite room was elevator, make sure you try that out.

"Escape room ""The Elevator"" by Exodus Escape Room in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exodus-escape-room-ah-the-elevator,2,The 5 stars is for BETH & the escape rooms!

"Escape room ""Terminal"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-terminal,0,"Unfortunately I can't give this escape room a good review. I've participated in 40+ escape rooms in the Phoenix area and this room was by far my worst experience out of all of them. On the plus side, the room was very well decorated and the experience was immersive, however the train car motion actually caused some pretty moderate nausea with no way to turn it off until the first puzzle was solved. The remaining portion of the room had a set of adequate puzzles, but then 2 longer puzzles that were simply annoyingly tedious, it never felt like we achieved anything when solving the puzzles.We didn't escape the room, however in similar situations in other rooms we have enjoyed laughing about where we made mistakes and how we could do better and appreciating the design of the puzzles - this room only left us frustrated and annoyed.These complaints are probably causes or magnified by the fact that, from our perspective, our GM was either ignoring our group, and the clues we did receive seemed to be lacking or were significantly delayed from when we did ask for help.Considering the premium cost of these rooms, we will unfortunately not be returning to finish their other rooms unlike the dozen or other companies that we have ""cleared out"". I really had such high expectations and never have been so disappointed with an escape room."
"Escape room ""Terminal"" by Great Room Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/mindspark-escape-games-terminal,1,"Place is great. We've done zombie, and terminal. Both were fun, and will be back for spell bound. Hope more rooms come soon!"

"Escape room ""The Disappearance at Fogmore Manor"" by The Entrapment in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/The-entrapment-at-fogmore-manor,6,"I will start with a disclosure that I'm friends with the owner and have been doing puzzle races with him for more than ten years now. However, I didn't help plan or test The Entrapment. I was actually proud to be one of its first official customers. I've done a few escape rooms and always felt that the puzzles were disconnected and lacking in innovation or just so random that they weren't enjoyable...none of that applies to The Entrapment! This escape room consisted of a variety of incredibly clever puzzles (of just the right difficulty) woven together in a story that made the experience unique and challenging. I loved that that there was a theme and story for the whole experience. Each object in the room was relevant and purposeful and added ambience. This is unlike the other escape rooms I've done that seemed to be full of completely unrelated puzzles or random office supplies that were intended to be puzzles. The story helped make the puzzles solvable and kept you connected to what was going on. I LOVED all of it and I can't wait until Scott creates another room to escape from!! In the mean time, get your friends together and book a time now!!!"

So unique compared to any other rooms I have done. I’ve been to rooms all over the country and world. Most games will focus on a multitude of locks/keys or numbers. “Bloody Elbow” only requires 1 key and no numbers. This made the game feel way more immersive and intuitive. It felt as if I was escaping like I would in real life. Physical activity required was such a good element! Highly recommend if your in the LA area.

The puzzles were all perfectly on theme and none of them felt ""tacked on"" at all. The set pieces were highly interactive, beautifully done, and larger than most rooms. Everything fit and gave a real sense of progression. I can't give enough praise to this experience. If you are thinking about trying it out, just do it.

Like all of their rooms, it's beautiful. It features a variety of different types and levels of puzzles. It's the perfect room for experienced enthusiasts as well as newcomers because there is a lot to do in this room. It's absolutely beautiful!I really like their rooms and for someone who tends to not like public bookings, this company's public booking policy doesn't bother me. For this room, I usually end up playing with a lot of newcomers and they tend to be quite easy going and terrific at working together. It's fun meeting new people and seeing what they come up with and finding solutions together. Because I've played their rooms before, it's easy to navigate and know when the in room game master is providing subtle hints, which are very useful. Watch your in room game master. If she/he is looking at something, it's probably best if a couple of people in your group see what they are looking at because there is an order to solving the puzzles in the different rooms.In terms of parking, I've usually found metered parking or I've walked to the venue or even have taken the subway and walked a little bit. The area is not fancy, but what area is in downtown Los Angeles.I like Escape Room LA's rooms a lot. I think their set designs are phenomenal and a bar above what many others are doing."

My kids, wife and myself all had an amazing time and really can't wait to experience the other rooms. The host that helped us is a real asset to this place.

We looked into doing something different and fun and found it. We hit the happy hour deals. They have a variety of drinks that satisfied everyone in our group. The food looked good. Didn't get a chance to try any.We tried a couple of their VR rooms. That was pretty cool. We opt to do the Raft. I believe it was the only one that was offered that night. But we had fun with that. I'm not too much into gaming but it was well worth the experience. We also did the one with the doctor. Now that one was pretty interesting. Since all of our group is involved in the medical field one way or another, it was pretty fun to try and keep the Patient alive. Took a lot of team work and felt like we were in the E.R. trying to keep the dummy alive!!! LOL!The arcade area was fun. Plenty of games to play. From famous arcades to tic tac toe Basketball to skiball. And don't forget to challenge your friends in a game of ice hockey made for 4.They seem to host private parties and have jumbo connect 4 and Jenga.

If not impressed by the room, you'll love the staff. It's owned by a lovely couple, who are very welcoming and fun to talk to. Our gamekeeper, Brian, seemed really easy-going and did his best to help us out whenever we needed, both before the game and during.

"Escape room ""Zombie Lab"" by Horror Escapes LA in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/horror-escapes-la-zombie-lab,0,"Don't be fooled by all the 5 star reviews!!!Just finished the Zombie Lab tonight and let me begin by saying, the pervious reviews hyped the room so much, but when we got there it was a big dissapointment. I am an escape room enthusiast and this was my 19th room. I would rank it 18th out of 19 rooms.  (Spoiler Free Review)Parking/Lobby:First off parking is hard to find but I suggest trying to find it on the street or at the lot at 11th and Olive. If you pass by that it will take to about 10 minutes to circle back around due to the one way streets and traffic. When we got there the host was by the door which was very nice because we were slightly unsure where to go. We entered and were told that there were going to be 6 other people in the room with us (randoms). The lobby was nice; theres a bathroom, lockers, and a bunch of comic books that are for sale. After waiting a few minutes we were shown the safety video, told the backstory of the room and then walked  to the room. The Room:Our first impression for the room was that it was fairly bland and lacking in decor. We got through the room fairly quick but we escape with 8 min to spare because we got hung up on a puzzle and because one of our locks was being finicky (The Game Master(GM) had to come in and help us with it since we had the correct combination in it and it still wasn't working). This room is a Gen 1 room, meaning the there is no technology puzzles in the room, just combos, locks and keys. The Zombie aspect of the room was one of the most hyped in the reviews but when we experienced it was sub par. The whole ""encounter"" is probably about 3-5 minutes since the zombie ends up leaving through the door (which didn't make sense in the plot line). I had thought that the zombie would be super scary and be with us until the end of the game but I was wrong. The actor playing the zombie did a good job for the time that they were in the room, I just wish they would have stayed in the room instead of leaving. The Hint System: You get 3 hints in this room, if you so close to take them. The are offered at the 30min mark, 15 min mark and 10 minutes mark (if i'm remembering correctly). During these time checks the GM would open the door and say ""The doctor will see you in ___ minutes."" I did not like that form of hints/ time checks at all, it really takes you out of the zone and pulls you out of the game mode. I think it would be so much better if they either had a screen with the clues and timer on it or a simple walkie talkie system. The Staff: Our GM was very friendly and courteous. She helped us get settled in and described the rooms to us very well. I did not like however that when you call the companies number with a question to ask, that no one picks up and it goes straight to a recorded message. Overall:I give this room 3 out of 5 stars because I felt like they could do so much more. The decor in the room was lacking and I honestly feel as though most of the room was wasted space. There were such few actual puzzles to solve in the room and the atmosphere in the room could have been better. The actor should stay in there room for longer, even stay the until the group escapes as that would add a element of rush and fear to the game. The hint system needs to be improved. Honestly, a $30 pack of walkie talkies would be sufficient enough because without it, every time you need a hint you're taken away from the game and brought back into ""reality"". I would only recommend this place to people who have never done an escape room before. After doing so many I just wasn't very impressed with this one. I'm hoping that their other rooms will be better. For the price though (we used Groupon) I would like to try to come back and escape there hardest room (The Office)."

"Escape room ""The Lab 51"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-mission2-the-lab,0,The only issue I have with Exit Game is that they pair you up with strangers. I went with a group of 3 and they paired us up with a group of 4. The whole time I felt like they didn't really contribute to anything as they had no clue what was going on. All I can say is that you really have to think outside the box in order to escape this room.

"Escape room ""The Lab 51"" by Exit Game in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/exit-game-mission2-the-lab,6,"Went here on a Saturday for a friend's birthday and did the Lab. It was a lot of fun! The story was that we were marines on a mission to escape an alien lab. You have 60 minutes to go through a series of complex puzzles, locks, clues, many rooms, and it was a great exercise in teamwork! It cost about $30/head and we had 10 people, which was a pretty good size for the challenge. The lab has a physical element to it where you need to crawl and duck your head low. They have alternatives if you cannot crawl or have claustrophobia, but it does take away from the overall experience, so opt for another challenge if that's a limitation of yours.  Especially compared to the Escape Game in Anaheim, this place was much more complex and believable with all the props and game design. It's not cheap, but a fun thing to do with a group of friends if you are looking for something different. It's located on the basement level of the Atlantic Shopping plaza where Empress Harbor Seafood and Half & Half are. Parking is free and head down the escalators to find it."

We loved it so much that we stayed and did Time Warp right after (there was an open slot). We have done multiple escape rooms in both Hawaii and Mississippi. Escape Dothan is by far the best one we have been to so far. The people that work the rooms allow you to struggle some before they give you hints. They don't make it too easy to get out! We plan on returning in the near future to do Murder at the Mansion and will continue to go as new rooms are opened. We highly recommend that everyone try Escape Dothan!

Instead of trying time to escape, you and your teammates have to get as much treasure as quickly as possible. This adds a different feel to the adventure and my friends and I had a fantastic time with our individual puzzles, as well as the puzzles we worked on together. Missed out on first place, but we smashed second place! Highly recommend Escape Chronicles to anyone looking for a good night of puzzle solving."

We will definitely be back for the Houdini room when it opens!"
"Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-noras-nightmare,2,"Played Nora's Nightmare yesterday and, it turned out, we were the first group to play the room since it officially opened.  As enthusiasts (almost 200 rooms played), we're always hesitant to try a brand new game as we've quickly learned it's much better to give them some time (even after beta testing) to fine tune things and make sure it runs they way they intended. But since we were jonesing for a room, we decided to go for it. From the first point of contact, via FB messenger, their customer service was spot on. The owner (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name) was friendly, very accommodating and responded to my inquiries quickly. As for the room, we enjoyed it quite a bit! I loved the unique theme and really liked the thought and details that were put into the aesthetics of the room. The puzzles are a good mix of lock & key as well as some tech so it should easily appeal to a variety of players. They are not overly difficult but they do still provide a good challenge and make you slow down to think. We are a two-person team and we finished with time to spare.  Afterwards, we spent quite a bit of time talking shop with the owner. She was very personable and didn't make us feel rushed or like she had something better to do. I know I already said it, but the customer service was on point with Puzzling Escape. As much as we love playing rooms, we also love talking with the owners and staff about the experience as well as about escape rooms in general.  We really enjoy hearing about what went into the design and development of their rooms and just learning about how it all started for them. We can't wait for their other rooms to open. Nora's Nightmare is a fun time for anyone looking for something neat to do. Regardless of your level of experience, get out there and play this game.  You'll be glad you did."

The room is decorated very nicely and the puzzles are challenging, but not too challenging to the point you get frustrated.  Our game master was Julie and she was very friendly and always ready with our hints (when needed).They have another room, Cabin 13, that we plan on trying next time.

I would definitely recommend! :)"
"Escape room ""The Cursed"" by Immersion in Orange County",https://worldofescapes.com/orange-county/quests/immersion-orange-the-cursed,2,"Did the Cursed escape room at Immersion and this room was on a whole  nother level compared to the other rooms that they own. The room is their latest room and they use modern tech for their cursed room. If you are thinking booking a room at Immersion, might I suggest the Cursed room over their other out-dated rooms. But in case you haven't guessed it from the room's name,  Cursed, expect it to be scary.The room is pretty packed but not overly expansive. A group of 4 seems ideal. Couples will likely experience a difficult time at Cursed while large groups will bump into each a lot in the cramped spaces.I did think the theme and story of the room was by far, the most bizarre plot I've experienced. But hey, that doesn't affect the quality of the room."

"Escape room ""PROstate Farm"" by Solve Who, LLC in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/solve-who-prostate-farm,0,"Absolutely fantastic! This is similar to an escape room game, but instead, you solve a murder. There are clues you have to find like blood, fingerprints, and a murder weapon. There are small details all over the place and it was actually funny as hell. The owners worked with actual detectives, forensic scientists, and the people who do autopsies! After you make your judgement and give your “verdict”, they go over how the murder transpired. It is split into 3 portions. First you investigate the crime scene, then you go over 3 interrogations with the 3 suspects, then you get all the evidence you found - back from the “lab” and an autopsy report. A really cool aspect, was that you report the evidence you find, so if you miss a clue, it won’t be turned back into you when you piece the mystery together with your group. I highly recommend this place!"
"Escape room ""PROstate Farm"" by Solve Who, LLC in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/solve-who-prostate-farm,1,"Came here as a double date with a group of 4 of us. We had a blast! I was expecting another escape room which start to have the same repetitive puzzles to solve and was pleasantly surprised that this was different. You're solving a crime rather than trying to escape. We did the PROstate insurance room and there were three parts. First you spend about 20 minutes at the area of the crime scene and then you go to the interrogation room and then you debrief where you try to put together all the evidence to figure out who the murderer was. I really commend them on the way they have this laid out and everything was in great condition. They even gave us a camera to use to take pictures of the crime scene. There was a ton of humor throughout this and we got a lot of good laughs. This was an awesome time and I can't wait to go back and solve the other crime! We ended up solving the crime, but it was difficult and we missed a lot of clues along the way. If you're looking for a fun night out I highly recommend!"

"Escape room ""Space Station Tiberia VR"" by Escape Room 101 in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-room-101-space-station-tiberia,1,"I went back and tried the VR room, the space room. Absolutely incredible. I have done VR before, oculus and Samsung vr, but not like this where you can walk around and see the other people in your group. If you have never tried it, you definitely need to. VR is so futuristic and needs to be supported.The space escape room itself want too hard... It honestly seemed like it was designed for kids. However it was just plain fun! You can pick things up and throw them around the space station, which just doesn't seem to get old. Escaping the room was almost secondary to the fun space elements.We got out pretty quick and they were nice enough to let us see the horror hospital VR walk through, which was... Interesting.Anyway, based on others reviews here for the physical escape rooms, try them at your own risk. But the VR rooms just seem plain fun."

"Escape room ""Sabotage"" by EscapeSF in San Francisco",https://worldofescapes.com/sfbay/quests/escapesf-sabotage,1,"Never seen a game like this before. It’s like an escape game but need to get into this suitcase. It looks like a high end movie prop, with keypad on top, and you get some gadgets to pick codes and such. Than it opens to more puzzles and another level and another level. Very clever. The military guy on TV gave some story about evil corporation and we worked on 8 cases at different tables. Ended up helping each other otherwise we probably wouldn’t have finished it in time. Their “secret safe house” was a bit hard to find. Check the address in the email. we went to their main office first but it’s just a block away. No big deal. "

Upon arriving we were treated by our game host Drew where he made us feel very welcome and was very easy to talk to. We did the Lab 51 room and it was a good mixture of difficulty with the challenges. The only thing I would say was a little frustrating was being tall lol. Without spoiling anything I would recommend my tall friends out there stretch before doing this room. We have done between 20-25 rooms and this was definitely in the top echelon. I look forward to doing the other rooms they have, and I am pretty sure they are going to rock as well. Great job Exitgame, you deliver a legit experience."

The puzzles were challenging but not frustrating, and above all I they were fun. There were many puzzles where I thought ""wow, that's clever!""--and i have probably done about 20 escape rooms at this point.

I am being a hater because the vacation vandals is HARD. It was a lot of fun but disappointed we couldn't solve it. We got about 3/4 done and got stuck. We probably should have asked for help sooner. We wanted to solve it on our own so we didn't call for a help clue till we were down to 15 minutes and by then it was too late we didn't have enough time to finish. But all the workers were super nice and the boys had fun doing a few games of laser tag beforehand. I will check back here seeing if anyone has solved it though.

"Escape room ""Fortune's Favor"" by Escape Sacramento in Sacramento",https://worldofescapes.com/sacramento/quests/escape-sacramento-fortunes-favor,1,"Super fun times solving Fortunes Favor! This one is a cool cave/forest feel. Really beautifully constructed to transport you into another place. I have previously done The Seance, Gallery, and Heist here and each challenge presents new solutions and methods that I've never experienced before. They really go the extra mile here. We had a great time with five of us in the room. The premise was fun and played on cultural knowledge. It had a mild level of creepiness/darkness which I personally prefer to heighten the excitement. Caitlyn (sp?) was a great hostess. Having the 8pm time slot, I think she let us have an extra 15min because we were on a roll. We really appreciated that because it let us fully discover the room and succeed rather than cue the lights and open the door with remaining unsolved puzzles. We will definitely be back here for another challenge next month. Maybe The Space Station... Our team can't wait!"

We completed the Saloon Room, and I can say that it was difficult to make all of us think, but also just easy enough for us to get out with 7 minutes to spare. Please please go here! Book a room online or call ahead, the price is well worth the hour given to play and if I'm ever in Flagstaff again I'll be trying to hit this place up."

We almost made it! Ugh! Definitely a return in the works for another room! Staff was super friendly and helpful! Go here, peeps! "
"Escape room ""Blood Thirst"" by Epic Escape Game in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/epic-escape-game-blood-thirst,4,"I played the Dracula game with 4 other people, I felt it was very well crafted.

"Escape room ""Six Shooter Bunk House"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-six-shooter-bunk-house,0,"Went with a group of 5, and we are all old hats at escape rooms. We've probably done about 20 so far in Vegas, St. Louis, Orlando, Phoenix, etc. This room was okay for a Tucson escape room. It was better than two other Tucson rooms we tried last weekend. The decor was very good - It did get you feeling like you were in the old west and there were some fun trinkets to look at. The downside for my group was that the puzzles/clues did not seem realistic - they were quite random and left us wondering things like, ""Why on earth would a person write that bit of info on that item??"" ""Why would a person ever hide that thing in this way?"" The puzzles and clues just weren't realistic at all. So if you are particular about authentic scenarios, you may be a bit underwhelmed here.If you don't care about practical story-lines and game play, then you will probably really enjoy this room!"
"Escape room ""Six Shooter Bunk House"" by Ace of Escape in Tucson",https://worldofescapes.com/tucson/quests/ace-of-escape-six-shooter-bunk-house,1,"We have done a room at each location, and both were so much fun.

We arrived with a group of 10 and did the mad lab. It was everybody's first time so we didn't know what to expect. We all had to sign a waiver and listen to instructions beforehand. You are not allowed to bring phones and purses. You will have to put it in a bin that will be in the same room with you. For the actual escape room, most of the times, we were screaming and scrambling so it was very hard to think while a chained up radioactive professor was chasing you. My heart was pumping pretty fast and my adrenaline was rushing. The mad scientist who was supposed to be our helper and guide, scared us even more! This was definitely not an easy escape room. We didn't make it in the 1 hr limit but it was still so much fun + SCARY! Definitely  check in yelp for the free extra hint because you will need it! Kudos to you if you can solve this escape room with no hints!"

We had a great time. The level of difficulty was challenging but not impossible. We did the ""Mad Lab"" scenario. There is a zombie on a chain and as time ticks by, the chain gets longer. If he touches you they put you in a cell and you have to answer questions to get out. Having this element added to the game definitely made it interesting and kept us on our toes!The staff was nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend this one!"
"Escape room ""Speakeasy Nouveau"" by Quicksand Escape Games in San Diego",https://worldofescapes.com/san-diego/quests/quicksand-escape-games-speakeasy-nouveau,0,"We played the Speakeasy Nouveau as a family. It was my husband and I and our two 10 year old boys.We have played a couple of escape rooms in the past as a family, so we have a little experience. This rooms is by far our very favorite ever. The story, variety of clues and puzzles, and props were all very well done. We also love the fact that its more than one room, you are led into more rooms with more clues which adds so much to the excitement! We found the clues sufficiently challenging, as we had to ask for a couple of hints along the way. The number of puzzles was perfect as we escaped with literally no time to spare. We had such a great time we came back the next night, while we were still in town, and brought another family along with us. The eight of us solved the Diner room. Again, great fun, great puzzles, and a large enough space so we all fit very comfortably and had plenty of different puzzles to work on simultaneously. They are also very competitively priced. Less expensive than some rooms we have visited, yet so much better!We highly recommend Quicksand Escape Games."

We attacked the Speakeasy Nouveau and got out with minutes to spare. There were a few minor hiccups however the hint system and the quick response by Andy kept the game flowing! All in all, Quicksand Escape is one of my top favorite escape rooms! I've completed The Diner, the Speakeasy, and Chinatown to date!"

We felt that the room was okay overall, good for those who are new to escape rooms. It was literally just locks and keys, as we felt that room didn't have a high production value because some of the clues and props just looked out of place. On top of that, when we were inside the room we could hear people talking really loudly outside, which broke our concentration from the room.

"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,0,"My group did The Basement & The Study and we left both rooms very disappointed.Let me begin by saying that we were extremely excited to do these rooms and we had heard so many good things about it. Long story short we don't think we will ever be coming back to this establishment. Study: The puzzles in the room were fairly basic but then they just became big leaps in logic. There is no direction to this room, and the hint system is at the discretion of the in-room actor, who only hinted 2 things in the room for us. Other than that she would just start yelling directly in our faces, talk about verbal abuse... We will admit that one of our players did break a rule by tossing a pillow in the room which ended up making contact with the actors arm. After which we were all reprimanded over the loud speaker which left a sour mood for all of us for the rest of the room. Do not put your actors in positions where there is no visibility and there is a possibly of them get hurt. An easy way to fix this would be to add a low red hue illuminating the space, that way both the actor and the customers have at least some visibility of what is happening. Frightened people will always have exaggerated reactions to elements unknown, so try to make those elements known. In the rules they are very clear about not climbing on any of the furniture however that is quickly thrown out the window as one of the puzzles requires interaction with some furniture. This had us all very confused as why we deliberately had to break a rule in order to solve the room. Also, throw all sense of safety out the window when you enter this room because you have to do some things that go completely against common sense and better judgement, again there is no direction telling you to do the task you just have to think of the unsafe action and do it yourself. The final puzzle that we got to was ""off by a hair"" as we were told by our game master at the end. This is always frustrating as literally a few millimeters can make the puzzle not work. This could be fixed by adding larger sensors or even making notches so that there are set amounts that triggers can hit. One of the most awkward parts about the end of the game was when the game master entered and asked us ""So how did your lovely actor do in the room?"". It's not an audition, she's already got the role you shouldn't need your customers to give feedback on them while they are in still in the room with you. Because to be honest who is really going to say something bad to the actor when they are right there in the room with you: like ""Yeah well you see she could have done a lot more instead of just standing in the corner and yelling at us"". Onto the pillow thing: Our player realized their mistake and apologized for their reactions but the way the Game Master handled it was unacceptable and unprofessional. She walked us out the lobby, sat us down while she reprimanded all of us about our actions for about 5 minutes saying that she needed a ""verbal confirmation"" from our player that they would ""behave properly"" in the room and that she could have just kicked us out without a refund. Honestly we probably would have been better off with that so that we didn't have to experience not only 1 but 2 terrible rooms. We all put that whole issue aside and we were now ready for the next room with hopes it would be so much better, spoiler alert, we were wrong, it was even worse. We were brought with our group & 4 other randoms into the waiting area where the game master yet again called us out for the pillow thing by saying ""don't throw anything at the actors or anything crazy like that"" while looking directly at us. Seriously?! You already spent time treating us like children and scolding us after the player apologized for their actions, be done with it and move on. The Basement: The entry style to the room was pointless & unnecessary, I guess it adds to the theming & immersion? Felt like a waste to me. The Basement has even less direction than the Study does. Be prepared to turn the whole room upside down in search for things. The flashlights were legitimately falling apart & were horrendously weak. The puzzles were a stretch, some of the visual clues were hard to differentiate: imagine 3 of the exact same locks with a 3 try limit on them. (For both rooms) When we feel like we are struggling we should be able to ask for a clue, it shouldn't be up to the actors to decide if we need it. Oh and in the room was an image of our player who tossed the pillow with the words ""PILLOW THROWER"" on it. Again, with the taunts & belittlement, are you kidding me. Not a way to make us feel comfortable or welcome anymore. Wish I could give this place 0 stars. Only reason I give 1 star is for the decor and windows in the Study but even then it was very sparse.Based on our experience I wouldn't be surprised if they try to not let you escape so that you come back and spend another $40 on it."
"Escape room ""Chapter 3: The Study"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-the-study,1,"Came back for The Study yesterday.

Even when we entered the room, she reviewed the rules once again.My boyfriend and I did the Casino Heist with just 2 people. It was definitely doable! You are allowed an unlimited amount of clues, but we only used one. After we were done, she came in and went over some of the things we missed/had questions about.Initially, I was a little skeptical to try 60out Escape Room since I had a bad experience with a different company in the past and it left a sour taste in my mouth in regards to escape rooms. But Mak and 60out Escape Room really turned my experience around. I can't wait to try out the other ones!! 60out Escape Room is my new ""go-to"" for escape rooms and I highly recommend everyone to check it out."

Although VR was not completely new for me, playing with a group was a different and unique experience. It had a similar style of challenge of their standard rooms, but it felt a bit easier. I'd still recommend it anyone.It's a bit disappointing that they're limited to only 2 games in VR. I wish they had more options. Since it's digital, it could be potentially unlimited. The employee made it sound like the games/rooms are expected to change every ~2 years. I wish they had more rooms  for more players (more than the 4 it's currently limited to). Until then, I suppose I have to go somewhere else for a new experience?! I"

Unfortunately, the room had some technical issues so we ended up doing the ""Designer's Studio"" instead.Luckily, we weren't disappointed at all. Though the puzzles are mostly gen 1 puzzles, made of locks and other gen 1 mechanics, there were actually gen 1 puzzles that were unique to that room that we had never seen before. I've done almost 150 rooms, and it's always fun to see new puzzles and there were plenty of new ones for me to see this time around too.Their games and wording are quite clever, so pay attention to those.Though the games are private games, I would recommend a team of 2 to 4 for more experience teams, and 4 or more for less experience teams."

The room is certainly not scary.There are 3 rooms, each self-contained. This means that you'll know when you have finished a room. There is then a meta-puzzle to escape.The puzzles mostly had sufficient clues to figure out, but our party of 3 had to ask for a few hints to make sure we were doing the right thing. One puzzle took a long time to slog through, which wasn't particularly exciting. All 3 of us were kept busy figuring things out.

"Escape room ""The Warehouse"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-WAREHOUSE,0,"It was a lot of fun. We did the Warehouse. We didn't escape, though. We had one more clue to unlock to get there. Only complaint would be getting joined with people we didn't know. I understand that is part of the drawback when having a small group, but it does make the experience a little less enjoyable. Other than that, we had a great time and plan to play more in the future."
"Escape room ""The Warehouse"" by Locked In in Birmingham",https://worldofescapes.com/birm/quests/Locked-In-THE-WAREHOUSE,1,We loved it! The warehouse was so much fun. My 15-year-old son was under the impression he was not going to have fun. But he hated to admit he had a blast with his mom and dad here. Such an awesome place! We highly recommend coming here.

We did this as a couples date and had a blast. It got pretty intense at the end. The staff were very friendly and shared information on the facility. The room we escaped from is not for the faint of heart. If anyone suffers from anxiety, you may want to reconsider the room we did ""Escape your nightmare"". Still wondering how my picture ended up on the wall..."
"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,1,"Very fun, well put together with great theming. We did the serial killer room with 3 people and it was a blast. With the looming threat of a serial killer barging into the room made for a very tense and exciting situation. I might not take people who are easily scared as the theme of the room is quite ""obvious"" (fake body parts etc.). Very much would recommend however. And looking forward to trying their other rooms."

"Escape room ""Escape Your Nightmare"" by Mind Games Clovis in Fresno",https://worldofescapes.com/fresno/quests/mind-games-clovis-escape-your-nightmare,4,"Did the ""Nightmare"" room as my first one. Me and 3 friends. Very cool setup - subtle enough that 4 30 year old+ people probably overthought the clues but straightforward enough that anyone could figure them out. That's to say it was nicely done. Easy to use the website, check in was easy, and the props were simple, if subtle for a ""Nightmare"" scenario.Will try a couple more escape rooms, but also want to come back here and try another room at least. ""Nightmare"" is their easy one and we still needed a lot of hints (hence my comment about my group likely overthinking it a bit)."

Firstly, big shout out to Ryan and the team who do a great job running the place and assisting as necessary. The rooms were well-decorated and the puzzles were lots of fun to figure out as they  were varying in complexity and required out-of-the-box thinking. The group I was a part of were a part of the beta testing for this particular escape room in Anaheim and I have to say it is worth the visit!I got to participate with people with and without experience and it was great fun.

I went with my co-workers as a team event, so we were able to fit 16 of us comfortably in there. None of the teams made it out, but it was super close! I loved how my team was working on one clue for a hot minute and we had read the clue ""upside down"" and one of the employees told us to take a closer look to make sure we were right....they nudged us enough to understand we had read the clue wrong but never gave the answer away. I would absolutely come back- so fun and it felt exciting to be in volcano *-*"

Our family decided to go at the last minute and were able to make reservations for a room all by ourselves in ""Uncle Jack's Cabin."" This was our first escape the room experience and it has to be one of our favorite family night activities. We were happy to have made it out with 14 min to spare. We were impressed with how well they thought out each clue and left looking forward to going back again. Our daughter would love to do this for her birthday party.

"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,0," This is a fun game! It is very immersive while still being puzzle heavy. We were paired with another couple that also happened to be escape room enthusiasts, so our team worked well together. The hint system keeps with the theme of the game and is very clever. There are puzzles in this game that I hadn't seen before. It's well done! "
"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,1,"The Testing Facility was a perfect example of a quality challenging room. I find that most rooms labeled as ""expert"" are only difficult because they simply don't make sense. This is not the case with this room. The room is non-linear with mini-puzzles are leading to one meta-puzzle, so it's a perfect set-up for larger groups. My husband and I attempted with just the two of us and made it to the last puzzle but we needed a few more minutes. Overall, it a great, logical and just plain fun room and we can't wait to come back and try their other room."

"Escape room ""Testing Facility"" by Escape Chronicles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/escape-chronicles-testing-facility,4,"I love, LOVE the extremely strong narrative thread throughout the entire experience. Everything, including the hint system, ties into the story experience. The Testing Facility is a puzzle heavy room. There is minimal searching in this room. I really appreciated that we had to use our brains more than our eyes. Lots of unique puzzles in this room. Everything from number puzzles, riddles, and word puzzles. Very inventive use of props and not a whole lot of padlocks. Clever use of tech in this room."
"Escape room ""Escape the Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber"" by Mission Escape Games in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/mission-escape-games-anaheim-escape-the-darkest-hour,0,"This place is amazing! We did a team building night in both rooms (one scary, one not) by Mission Escape with 8 people per room. The storylines are fantastic and the mechanics they use are like magic. This goes beyond just hunting for codes to open locks (although plenty of those too!), but they use great technology to make the experience completely immersive. They really want you to succeed, so the progressive storyline is enhanced by the tech to guide you where you need to go so you don't feel completely lost and stuck. And even if you do get stuck they give you just enough hint to get you where you need to go.We screamed, we laughed, we loved every minute!"

And even though she was terrified of the Horror Theme for The Darkest Hour, she had an amazing experience. The game itself has a lot of unique and interesting puzzles. The whole game makes you think outside the box. It's a little difficult but if you bring a good sized group you all will have a lot of fun figuring out the clues for the escape."

Brought a mixed group of experienced and inexperienced escapers to try out the new Darkest Hour: Torture Chamber. We were wowed, spooked, tricked, and then escaped.

Both stories are well thought out and immerse you from minute one. Darkest Hour was a little more simple (in my opinion) but the anticipation and thrilling nature force you to work a littlest more trepidatiously. The puzzles are innovative and unlike some of the puzzles I've seen before, the room is built to change music, lights, and mood of the room as you solve puzzles and progress. Joel was our puzzle master and he was amazing! Very engaging, a great conversationalist, and very supportive. Do yourself a favor and book this room, you'll have a blast!"

We are a group of 6 that have completed about 10-15 rooms. We do not think the difficulty rating on this one is appropriate. I would say it's medium difficulty, bordering on easy.It was unique to be split up with your group. It was a fun room and concept even though we felt like it was a little bit easy.Also, finding the spot is a little difficult. It's kind of hidden on the side of the road with a high rolling fence at the entrance to the parking lot."

Did it with two other couples on date night. Had a blast! We did the kidnapped room. It was a lot of fun, and we were able to escape from the room with nine minutes left, without any hints. Our wives were taken into a separate room and we had to rescue them and then continue all together. Don't want to give any too many details, but it was fun and challenging. The hardest part was that they didn't really tell us anything from the beginning. We just had to figure out what we needed to do. You get locked in a room with no instructions except to get out. A lot of fun, would totally recommend for groups of friends or team building activities for businesses. I was a little worried that you would have to be a genius puzzle solver. The puzzles/riddles/challenges were clever, but solvable. Thanks for a great evening PanIQ Room staff!"

This is a perfect experience for a lot of friends (I tend to cap my group at 4), but I love that this experience gets everyone involved at all times. Everything made sense and flowed beautifully.This was the 117th room I've played and words can't begin to describe this whole experience. They've got an awesome thing going here and I'm sure many more reviews will concur. Escape rooms should follow suit of what this company has got going for them."
"Escape room ""Stash House"" by Stash House in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/stash-house,2,"Stash House is probably my favorite escape room so far!!

"Escape room ""The Cellar"" by Key Quest in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/The-Cellar-Key-Quest-F,0,"This is a work in progress, but was good for the price.  The ""serial killer"" theme was well done and the puzzles are as expected for an escape room.  Without spoilers, they include looking for things with black lights, organizing clues, and opening lock boxes using various clues given to you.This is in an empty birthday party room devoted for the escape room experience, and had a creepy vibe, especially given the halloween party decorations that are part of the puzzle.  This location seems geared to kids, although this was slightly too scary and too hard for most children. The organization says that they have been visiting other escape rooms in Orange County, and are tinkering with and changing things here to make it better and better.  It may be worth it to wait a few months until a new experience is announced.  But for the much lower price compared to other escape rooms, this is worth it if you are in the area."

We were a group of 9 and we were able to finish the quest in under 45 mins. Yes we did use our hints but we still figured it out. We did the room called 'The Cellar'  and it was really fun. We will be doing it again.

"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,0,We came to 60out for our yearly team building day and we had so much fun! We got the Hangover room and escaped. It was awesome! Our team consisted of five and none of us have ever done an escape room so we considered this a win! Highly recommend and Victoria was great!
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,1,The Hangover was my 38th room. This room was decorative and set the scene up for the story. It made me feel like I was immersed in the story quite well. The puzzles were actually fun to do and were quick and on a whim type of solving. No real scavenger hunt in here which was nice and towards the end waa my favorite part because of the props we had to use in order to get out. Loved all of it.
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,2,"We had some minor tech hiccups in this room, but our game master was able to fix things for us quickly. We had to do something physical in this room that we've never done before, which was super cool! It's a pretty tech-heavy room and uses almost all your senses. I don't think there were any traditional lock-key puzzles (though I could be wrong). The end is incredibly clever!"
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,3,The set decor is mind blowing. The puzzles are intuitive and fun. Highly recommended. My friend runs an escape room of her own and she had a blast as well. 
"Escape room ""Mafia"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-hangover,4,"We did the new Hangover room. It was lots of fun and we really enjoyed it.At first, I was a reluctant Escape Room virgin but I am so glad I gave this a try. The reason I was initially hesitant is because I don't like places where I can't get out, and I don't like being scared. Haunted houses and being mid row in any arena is my nightmare.These games are terrific because they help you work together as a team while tapping into out of the box thinking and communication skills. I look forward to an opportunity to try another escape room.My friends said this was one of the better ones they have been to in LA and Phoenix."
"Escape room ""Imprisoned"" by Auburn Escape Zones in Auburn",https://worldofescapes.com/auburn/quests/auburn-escape-zones-imprisoned,0,"This was so fun!

"Escape room ""Imprisoned"" by Auburn Escape Zones in Auburn",https://worldofescapes.com/auburn/quests/auburn-escape-zones-imprisoned,1,"My husband and I just did the imprisoned challenge, and we will definitely be repeat customers. The staff was cheerful and helpful, and the clues they gave were great as well. We were floored by the details that went into our room, and we had a blast trying to keep track of all the clues. The puzzles were the right amount of challenging, and they throw in some fantastic twists that made it even better. We hadn't even left the parking lot before we started planning our next trip back. I can't recommend it enough!"

"Escape room ""Humana Festum"" by The Basement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/the-basement-humana-festum,0,"I did the new Humana Experience two days ago, which includes 4 mini escapes + 2 tacos and 2 cocktails with each ticket (more can be purchased). I've done two other rooms in the past (which are AMAZING), but the new Humana Experience was so much fun...and less stressful due to the drinks and social time. Have a drink, solve a room...eat a taco and have another drink...try another room, etc. etc. etc. Best of all, on Humana night, you can keep trying until you solve! Also, as always the actors are phenomenal! My boyfriend and I beat all the mini-rooms, so in addition to winning little trinkets, you get 20% off your next booking, which has to be purchased on the spot...and we did! I think we'll go for the Elevator Shaft next!You ROCK The Basement, and best of all you're only 7 minutes from my house!"

"Escape room ""Disco Fever!"" by Escape Rooms Mesa in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/escape-rooms-mesa-disco-fever,0,"This is an AWESOME way to spend an evening!  Played the time travel room first and had so much fun with Braden as our game master that we came back the next night to play the boogie room!  This as with any escape room, some things in the room didn't always work as planned and Braden did such a good job making sure it didn't trip us up.  Plus, when we got stuck and asked for one of our 3 ""free"" clues, he was great at giving us just the right push to get past what was blocking us.  Disco was super challenging, with clues that weren't logical to find, we definitely needed all 3 freebies plus our extra 10 minutes & clues.  But loved the multi-room adventure!"

My partner and I did The Pearled Pachyderm. It was just the two of us. The room was set up in such a way that flowed and felt like it made sense, rather than just collecting random letters, numbers and keys. The story, while minimal, made all the puzzle solving feel a little cooler. I liked the hint system as well. We only used one but they gave us a perfect hint that didn't tell us too much but got us out of our mental block. I can't wait to come back and do another!"
"Escape room ""The Pearled Pachyderm"" by Phoenix Puzzle Room in Phoenix",https://worldofescapes.com/phoenix/quests/Phoenix-Puzzle-Room-The-Pearled-Pachyderm,2,This was amazingly fun! I went with a group of 8 friends and we conquered the Pearled Pachyderm with 11 minutes to spare! I'm happy to say that it was challenging mentally even with 8 adults working on the clues together. If you like problem-solving then this is definitely a must try. Can't wait to go back and do the second room!

My team of seven were warmly welcomed to a clean and friendly lobby. Our game master Janey was fun and professional! When we beat the room record she was excited with us. The overall experience was awesome! The room itself was a 9/10 difficulty and it was pretty complex. We’re fairly experienced escapists and this room was truly difficult. I totally recommend Puzzling Escape!

I volunteered to be the first victim in, and was rewarded by being handcuffed down. Be warned there's a lot of blood and it has a definite creep factor. These puzzles were not as challenging mentally, but because of the handcuffs and clear physical limitations, proved to be pretty difficult to finally escape. "
"Escape room ""Zodiac"" by Room Escape Los Angeles in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/room-escape-los-angeles-zodiac,2,I did the Zodiac room with my girlfriends and had so much fun!

"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,0,This room is definitely challenging. I went with a group of 6 and I felt like I wasn't doing anything in certain parts of this room because there was no space for me. I admit that some of the puzzles I could not figure out but luckily for me my teammates were really smart about this. I would recommend this room for anyone who is looking for a challenge because this room definitely got me thinking a lot. 
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,1,"I did the Da Vinci room with my friends last night and had a blast. This room is extremely challenging and sooooooo good. The puzzles felt really unique and the decor was top notch. Plus, if you finish under the time limit with 2 clues or less you get a prize. Sheryl was our game master and she was super helpful and nice. We will definitely be back!"
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,2,"Just did the Da Vinci room and it's excellent. The puzzles are very challenging but never unfair. Some of them are pretty ingenious and they all stuck with the theme very well. Basically if you want to feel like Tom Hanks in the Da Vinci Code but without the awkward mullet, this is the place to go. I did this with 6 other experienced escapees and we still got out right at the 75 minute mark (or so the game master Sheryl tells us. She definitely played up the drama and was very helpful overall). I'm looking forward to trying the two other rooms at this location."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,3,I recently did the Da Vinci room with my friends and it was easily one of the best rooms I've ever done.  I thought the 75 minutes might feel too long but it was perfect considering the huge amounts of amazing/difficult puzzles which perfectly fit the theme of the room. Sheryl was definitely one of the best game masters I've ever had at any escape room I've been to.
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,4,"This is a beautiful room but it is really hard. Since the puzzles are so different, it took us some time to understand what to do. We spent a lot of times on puzzles we thought we could solve faster. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to get through this but there are plenty of others who have finished this room within that time frame. We had a group of 6 and when time ran out we were told we still had a few more puzzles to complete. Even though I am salty about the loss, I still highly recommend this room to the seasoned escape room goer."
"Escape room ""Da Vinci's Secret"" by 60out Escape Rooms in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/60out-escape-rooms-da-vincis-secret,5,"We have done about a dozen escape rooms (from 60out as well as a couple other companies) and this is honestly the hardest room that I have ever done. The room had tons of unique puzzles, not just lock and key. I don't even think 75 minutes is enough time to solve all of the puzzles. Even though we got tons of hints we were unable to escape. Despite this, we still had a lot of fun. I would recommend Da Vinci for escape room pros and bigger groups (maybe 4-6 people) so that each person can work on different puzzles at the same time."
"Escape room ""Doll House V.2"" by PuzzleMazement in Los Angeles",https://worldofescapes.com/los-angeles/quests/puzzlemazement-doll-house,0,"We did the ""Doll House""! This was our 6th Escape Room, and it was easily one of the best! This is the only one I have ever done that had 3 different levels of rooms that needed to be cleared. It was like unwrapping a present to find another present that needed to be unwrapped, and I loved that! The back story was creepy, but fun...which added its own special element to the whole experience! Jake was an excellent host, and I am excited to go back to try another room! Definitely money well spent!"

First time doing one and Ariel really helped a lot! She was able to guide us through some beginner rooms. We did 2 rooms, Dr. S (a steam punk room) and the doll house. Doll house was 3 stories and with 8 people we were able to make it with a minute to spare! Great team building exercise and super fun. Especially for the price. Definitely going to be doing more in the future."

My only criticism was that we were told all the clues we had missed and if they hadn't told us we would probably do the same one again. A missed opportunity for more business.

I started doing escape rooms a couple months ago, but this one totally went beyond my expectations.  6 of us did the room, Wanted in the West, which was recommended by the sales rep for first timers.  We finished the room in about 40 minutes with no hints!  The puzzles were fun and challenging while still being reasonable.  The room was super duper cool, well set up, and kept us on our toes.  We had some trouble with payment, but everyone was very helpful in getting it all taken care of.  The staff was kind and friendly.  The overall experience was five stars, and I hope to do more rooms like this one!"

There were some surprises I did not expect at all, and I don't want to give anything away, but it was a blast collaborating with my family and friends.  I totally want to do it again, so I can't wait for them to build out their others rooms.  They had lockers to stash your stuff and they provide a keyed lock that you keep on your possession so you know your stuff is safe.It was nice to have something like this in Canyon Country.  Shout out to Betitos next door if you love Mexican food."
