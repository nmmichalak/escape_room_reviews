251,alaska,/juneau,/juneau/quests/escape-game-alaska-espionage,0,"I'm the Owner of Escape Game Alaska and regarding Julie's review, I just want to share this because I clearly remember the two of them as customers. I would never feel the need to write this but I do feel that, as business owners, we live in a world where customers are able to review us but we, as business owners, are not given the opportunity to respond. While I am grateful to have customers play and avidly try to make it through the game, I also need to ensure that my prop decor, investments in making the rooms authentic and detailed, and game pieces do not get damaged- so that other players can play the game as well. During the game, it was clear that there was not a lot of respect for the facility or objects in the game room. (NOTE: some of the books in the rooms are antiques that were gifted to us with the intent of us caring for them; I intend to uphold that responsibility. As well, if a game piece is damaged, it can impact the game experience of people who are scheduled to play following that game). During game play, I observed the two of them dropping and damaging items in the room, kicking gaming pieces with their feet to move them after they'd dropped them on the floor and walking on top of materials. This is not how many of our participants and visitors play. While it may have appeared that I was ushering them out of the room with the intent of going to lunch; I did not go to lunch (despite the fact that I'm quite sure many other humans do)- I just didn't want to have them play any other games especially not our Gold Rush room which is stocked with many items that are over 110 years old. Regarding the difficulty of the game, while experienced gamers may make it out with time on the clock, there are still a lot of players in our area that have never played a game before and we work to ensure that all gamers escape. Our escape games are different (we note that 'everyone escapes' on our website) and we think that people enjoy the positive experience. While we can't please everyone, we do think preservation of the experience for other players is more important than allowing our games to be damaged for solely two people. While input is always appreciated, as business owners, we weigh out cost and benefit on a regular basis. It was my decision that it was potentially more costly to have the two of them play another game than it was beneficial. As well, if our experience was so bad, I'm not sure why the two of them asked to play another game.

You have to go through everything to avoid missing an “obvious” clue). The woman running the show was the reason for the bad review. She had her boyfriend stop in before we entered the room and told him that after she was finished here that they could grab food. She’s allowed to have a personal life, sure, but shooing customers out the door after they beat the game saying she has “a thing to do” is just unprofessional. We told her that we had an interest in doing another game (there were no bookings after us) and she told us that she it was doable with 2 people, but she “would rather not have [us] in that room because *this* (gestures around to the scattered items of the room) can’t happen in that room”...it was extremely rude.

465,arizona,/phoenix,/phoenix/quests/puzzling-escape-noras-nightmare,2,"Played Nora's Nightmare yesterday and, it turned out, we were the first group to play the room since it officially opened.  As enthusiasts (almost 200 rooms played), we're always hesitant to try a brand new game as we've quickly learned it's much better to give them some time (even after beta testing) to fine tune things and make sure it runs they way they intended. But since we were jonesing for a room, we decided to go for it. From the first point of contact, via FB messenger, their customer service was spot on. The owner (I'm so sorry I don't remember her name) was friendly, very accommodating and responded to my inquiries quickly. As for the room, we enjoyed it quite a bit! I loved the unique theme and really liked the thought and details that were put into the aesthetics of the room. The puzzles are a good mix of lock & key as well as some tech so it should easily appeal to a variety of players. They are not overly difficult but they do still provide a good challenge and make you slow down to think. We are a two-person team and we finished with time to spare.  Afterwards, we spent quite a bit of time talking shop with the owner. She was very personable and didn't make us feel rushed or like she had something better to do. I know I already said it, but the customer service was on point with Puzzling Escape. As much as we love playing rooms, we also love talking with the owners and staff about the experience as well as about escape rooms in general.  We really enjoy hearing about what went into the design and development of their rooms and just learning about how it all started for them. We can't wait for their other rooms to open. Nora's Nightmare is a fun time for anyone looking for something neat to do. Regardless of your level of experience, get out there and play this game.  You'll be glad you did.","Escape room ""Nora's Nightmare"" by Puzzling Escape in Phoenix","Description:Nora is an imaginative little girl whose dreams have always been filled with unicorns and rainbows, but ever since her special dream catcher went missing, she has been having increasingly disturbing dreams.

We failed the room, going over our 60 minute time by 3 minutes or so.

Time is of the essence and the more minds working together, the better. However, it is by no means impossible to do this with only two or three people.We did the Wild West room and we felt like this was a good challenge level for us since this is our first escape room (we've heard that at PanIQ, the Kidnapping room is the most challenging with the Alien room being a close second). We would have finished the room in time (I imagine) but we didn't realize it was ""okay"" to ask for hints.

683,arizona,/phoenix,/phoenix/quests/international-room-escape-az-gravitational-effect,2,"Gravitational Effect - I think I liked this room better than Amazon Rainforest. They tried to make the room 4D by giving you 3D glasses to enhance the experience but, let's be honest, they're not going to do anything other than make you trip and/or make the puzzles difficult because you can't see them straight. They are not needed to play the game so they are pretty pointless, in my opinion. We didn't even put them on. For the most part, the puzzles made sense and a few were challenging but not overly difficult. There were a couple of puzzles I felt that if they were improved upon they would make the experience more immersive. One of the puzzles involved ""jackets"" which, at first, we thought were just plastic bags. This made the puzzle seem kinda cheesy because they were just cheap rain ponchos that didn't really fit with the room. Perhaps investing in some actual jackets to make it more themed would help spruce up this puzzle some. The other puzzle was the final puzzle. I don't want to give anything away so I won't say anything about it other than it had absolutely nothing to do with the theme of the room. But even with that being said, I do want to say that there was one ""puzzle"" that was more of a physical challenge and that was a lot of fun. It caught us off guard when we saw it (which is almost always a good thing in the world of escape rooms) and we laughed a lot through it.

Ive never done these before and was honestly blown away with how smart the puzzles were. The only complaints I have is both were for 10 people ( our party had 5) and it felt like 10 was way too many people. In both rooms it really felt like maybe 4 or 5 clear leaders took the reigns, 3 people helped and at least 2 people were completely useless and either got in the way or stood in the corner probably not enjoying themselves. The rooms really should be capped at 8. Also there should be an option to book a room as adults only or kid friendly. I can see for adults who've paid the money and are really into doing the puzzles, having to let little Timmy unlock the box or push the buttons or have a turn reading clues is just obnoxious and ruins the experience they played for. There should be like Escape the Room Junior for kids (of appropriate age) so that anyone who books that knows what they are signing up for. Likewise, being the only kid in a group where you might mot know everyone in the party is awkward for the kid and really opens up the door to awkwardness if your kid isn't totally well behaved or is competing with random adults to solve a part of the puzzle.","Escape room ""Jurassic Escape"" by Escape The Room Scottsdale in Phoenix",Description:Dinosaurs are loose and hunting again in Oak Brook thanks to an evil corporation’s cloning experiments.

The personalities of others you don't know can be overwhelming and squander the experience at times.Our room guide/host would offer assistance at times, but her timing was somewhat frustrating.

We recently came back to do OutBreak, which we knew was the hardest room, but this room is specifically meant as a money grab room, which I have played a few rooms like this, elsewhere; before! What I mean by that is the room is designed so you don't make it out, and they take your $100 bucks that is costed you to book it! There is a difference between challenging and just making it so hard that you spend the whole time on one set of puzzles starting at screens which hurt your eyes! I thought the concept of the room was awesome but the way the room was laid out, game wise was not good at all!

805,arizona,/tucson,/tucson/quests/fox-in-a-box-tucson-zombie-lab,0,"This review comes from a group that has completed about 20 escape rooms across the nation, including in cities such as Orlando, St. Louis, Las Vegas. We have encountered some so-so rooms, some decent rooms, and some amazing rooms. What we LOVE - They don’t mix you with strangers in the rooms! That is awesome! This room, the Zombie Lab, was a little bit of a disappointment for us. We had previously done, over several years, both the Bank Heist and the Western room at this venue. The western themed room has the best theming of them all, as it is the most immersive, though even there you’ll see odds and ends that appear to be incomplete, like a certain ceiling tile installation/work-around that looks sloppy.  First off - TONS of locks. Locks, locks, locks! That is typical of many entry-level rooms. The puzzles ARE fun, but not many of the puzzles relate to the stories! It seems like the rooms are decorated, and then filled with a hodgepodge of random puzzles that don’t actually contribute to the theme or the story. You’re walking around thinking, “How is this puzzle related to the story at all?”  Another aspect that is a bit of a letdown: Having to watch an intro video in the lobby in front of other groups. It’s just awkward standing around a television next to the counter to watch a poorly written (and full of grammatical errors and misspellings!) video before entering the room. Lastly, it would be nice if the employees conveyed some enthusiasm for the job at hand. The instruction segment given to each group by the employee is too long and rushed. It’s a LOT of talking for them, and they talk fast to get through it, which is just annoying for everybody. The instructions should be more concise.

884,arkansas,/fayetteville-ar,/fayetteville-ar/quests/the-escapeopolis-project-1959,7,Unfortunately this was the absolute worst escape room I have ever done. Which is unfortunate because the couple that run it obviously put a lot of time into it. My wife and I have done 20+ escape rooms in several different states across the country and this one was BY FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE and BY FAR THE WORST! We brought 2 friends that had never done an escape room and I am so sorry that was their first experience. We paid $140 to do their newest room having something to do with time travel. Sadly after having spent over 2 and a half hours there total I still can't even properly explain the room. He talked FOREVER before we even were allowed in. Even though I had asked repeatedly to go to the bathroom. Then serval of there props didn't work. The flashlight we needed to get into the second room wouldn't turn on. The intro video was excessively long. They entire thing was WAY TO COMPLICATED! The clues he gives you aren't even real clues and they were off center so we couldn't even see all of it on the screen. I was so upset with how ridiculous everything was that we told him we were done even before our time ran out. We just wanted to go home. He offered to let us come back for free to do this room again since so much of equipment didnt work correctly but he should have offered us half our money back. I will NEVER go back and I will be sure that none of my friends go either. If you want a fantastic escape room experience go to Bolt NWA!

1003,arkansas,/russellville,/russellville/quests/hourglass-escape-rooms-camelot,2,"We tried the Camelot Room on a recent Friday evening (along with my youngest son’s college roommate). We called and reserved the room in advance.The 2 staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. After paying and signing waivers, we were shown a short video explaining the “Do’s & Dont’s” and how to use the iPad.They have lockers where you store your cell phones (& other items if you choose), as they do not allow phones in the rooms.This escape room does not use interactive game masters that we were used to. Instead, your hints are delivered by scanning QR codes around the room with the iPad. When you use the hints, it deducts from your time. There is also a bell in the room that you can ring at any time to have a game master come in and help if needed.We found the Camelot room to be challenging, but not to the point that it was frustrating. It wasn’t easy, but it also wasn’t so hard that it was unsolvable. The theme, layout, and props were all thought out very well.Without using any hints, we did escape with a couple of minutes to spare. Although I must admit, had it not been for our kids, my wife and I probably would’ve struggled a little more to make it out in time.After you escape, they take a group photo, which they post to their Facebook page.Overall, we had a great experience and will definitely try one of the other rooms next time!The only negative thing I can say (and it’s not that big of a deal) is that their sign and parking area were not very well lit and we actually passed the place when we first drove by.","Escape room ""Camelot"" by Hourglass Escape Rooms in Russellville",Description: The King is dead and the throne in Camelot sits empty.
