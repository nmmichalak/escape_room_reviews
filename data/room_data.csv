"Escape room ""7 Deadly Sins"" by Escapology Orlando in Orlando",https://worldofescapes.com/orlando/quests/escapology-orlando-7-deadly-sins,"11951 International Dr C3 Orlando, FL 32821","Crickley Church, 31st October, Present Day...

In the late 19th century, during an ill-fated Halloween service, the deranged minister of Crickley Church decided to kill his entire congregation after their confessions had convinced his twisted mind that they had, among themselves, committed the 7 Deadly Sins. In order to punish them for their sins, the evil minister passed around poisoned bread and wine.

As the congregation choked on their last breaths, the minister incited a curse on the children playing in the rooms beneath the church, and then buried himself alive in the church’s hidden crypt, determined to haunt the church forevermore. Your Great Grandfather was one of those innocent children. You began to think back on the mysterious deaths of family members and close friends ever since that fateful night.

Trawling the many ancestry websites to gather your evidence leads to a terrifying conclusion. Every year on Halloween someone related to a member of the congregation dies an unnatural death. As you study the pattern of these accidents and the people involved you discover that you are next - and time is running out...

In your panic, you contact the American Paranormal Society and they have told you that the only way to end the curse is to find the body of the evil minister and drive a sacred dagger through the remnants of his heart. This will lift the curse, and the souls of the victims will finally be able to rest in peace.

Not wishing to take on such a daunting task alone, you have convinced your bravest friends to race to Crickley with you, break into the abandoned Church and find the hidden crypt. You enter the churchyard at 11 pm and the iron gates immediately slam shut behind you, locking you inside. The minister seems to be playing one last trick on you. Can you complete your mission and escape the church before the clock strikes Midnight? Or will you fulfill the curse and your name be the next on a headstone in your family’s graveyard plot?

Find the hidden crypt, find the dagger, and drive it through the heart of the evil minister. Then and only then you will be saved and will destroy the curse forever.

Matters soon turn horribly wrong when your friend explains the REAL purpose of your trip. Promising enormous wealth, he wants you to return to the US with some suitcases he has packed for you.

He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance. 
Blackbeard only spent about two years (1716-1718) plundering the high seas. Within that time, however, he amassed a great deal of wealth. While the Spanish were busy obtaining all the gold and silver they could extract from Mexico and South America, Blackbeard and his crew waited patiently, then pounced on the treasure-laden ships as they sailed back to Spain.
On November 21, 1718 in Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, Blackbeard was ashore entertaining guests unaware that two ships led by British Lieutenant Robert Maynard were preparing a surprise attack to finally put an end to the notorious pirate. In the ensuing battle the next morning, Blackbeard was killed.
When Blackbeard’s ship was searched, no treasure was found. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumored hoard of gold and silver, but nothing has been found. Blackbeard's personal ledger notes that his real treasure ""lay in a location known only to him and the devil.""
So what became of Blackbeard’s treasure?  Is it waiting to be found or simply the stuff of legend? Back In Time has been hired by an anonymous treasure seeker to go back and search the captain's quarters in Blackbeard's ship, the Adventure, and try to shed some light on this mystery.

The single family home, with it’s empty windows and silent halls attracted attention from local children and teens over the years. 

Locals often call it haunted but every so often someone was dared to go inside, however, it wasn’t rare for the person to disappear completely. Or worse, come out gibbering nonsense and failing to gain their mind back afterwards. 

But why? What could be so horrendous inside that people’s sanity crumbled? You and your friends have decided to find out. You’ve gathered every scrap of evidence you could get your hand on, and discovered little. The last family to live there were Jane and Jerald Robinson, a happy couple with children. A news article you had dug up detailed a strange exit from the home. No packing was done. No pre-planned moving. It was as if they had suddenly fled in the middle of the night. 

Even stranger still, though the article talked about 2 children, it only mentioned a son. Why did this family leave and why is only one child identified?

Your fearless group has decided to answer these questions for yourselves. Stepping foot on the property. In the window, a light flickers, and the sound of a girl’s high-pitched giggle echoes as you open the front door. Will you discover where this ghostly giggle originates?

 Or will you too, become it’s victim?

Loathed by scores and loved by few, Herbert’s body was discovered in the master bedroom of The Devlin Manor, an extravagant estate built by Herbert in the 1930’s.
The Devlin Manor is the home of many unspeakable truths and spirits. Over the decades, numerous “incidents” and homicides have transpired in the cursed house. In 1935, Mrs. Devlin was found dead of an apparent suicide, having hung herself from the beam over their shared marital bed. After his wife’s sudden demise, Herbert Devlin started to spiral. His mornings began with a daily cocktail of amphetamines and his nights ended in a pool of his own bile and liquor. But alas, two years later, Herbert remarried his youthful caretaker Estelle Williams, who once claimed to have seen her predecessor roaming the halls sobbing.
Six individuals (The Widow, The Firstborn, The Business Partner, The Maid, The Secondborne, and The Psychic) have, by no random accident, been named in Mr. Devlin’s final will and summoned to the manor. Upon arriving at the sprawling estate, the inheritors are greeted by the Butler and taken into the windowless dining room.
Once every guest has arrived, the Butler seals the doors shut with Mr. Devlin’s final testament, a wax-cylinder recording of his own ghoulish voice, inside. Mr. Devlin informs them that he suspects one of them to be the culprit behind his own death.
Becoming one of these six characters, you all have sixty minutes to search the darkest corners of The Devlin Manor and find the truth behind Herbert Devlin’s death in order to claim your inheritance. Per demand, the hapless Butler has poisoned every guest’s dinner to assure complete cooperation.

Immediately, everyone is infected but that isn't your biggest problem. The chemical detection sensor has picked up the threat and shutdown the facility. Total decontamination will begin in 60 minutes (eliminating all biological organisms inside)!

Words written by a then, young Jon Doren, a loner raised in a fatherless home by his mother though rarely did she act like one, always insisting that he 'grow up' or 'stop acting like a child'.

At times, she would use restraints to exile him to a mere corner of his tiny bedroom when simply locking him in there was not, as she viewed it, enough. Fearing his mother's wrath and the ridicule of his peers he would generally bide his time in a small crawlspace his mother was unaware of.

This sanctuary, like other nooks in the house had more than one door which allowed him to move around the house without detection, a luxury he has long enjoyed...

At far too young an age he began smoking cigarettes, stealing them from him mother usually but occasionally lifting them from a nearby gas station whose busy owner rarely noticed him in the small store area as he was generally servicing a car in the garage portion of the building or out front pumping gas for a customer. Smoking ensured that he always had access to matches or a lighter and playing with them became something of a pacifier.

When he was 17, his mother committed suicide. Her body was cremated, and no service was held. Her remains arrived at his doorstep, having been delivered by the post office like a common piece of mail. He kept her ashes, eventually transferring them from the cardboard box they came in to a wooden box he crafted himself. Into the lid he carved the word 'MOM' in all capital letters, and he put her in the same place where he kept various items that had meaning to him.

He eventually moved a few miles away but he kept the house he grew up in as it had been willed to him. More would likely be made from an insurance claim than from the sale of the house since it was sorely in need of repair. Between the peeling wallpaper, leaky roof, water damage, sloping floors and electrical issues it is probably best left abandoned...

Over the last twenty or so years, countless atrocities have unfolded but many go unsolved. Experts believe it is the work of a single, serial arsonist acting alone. They suspect he probably derives pleasure from these acts and is likely to keep trophies of his exploits. These trophies will probably be the only evidence that will connect him to these crimes.

"Escape room ""Zombie Apocalypse"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-area-51,"72 Broad Street SW Atlanta, GA, 30303","Hope has about run its course here. We’re all beyond exhausted; the only thing that keeps us moving at this point is sheer force of will. The zombies won’t stop coming, and no matter what we do, nothing ever seems to make a difference – until now.

A few months ago, we got in touch with some sort of government facility. They had been completely cut off from the rest of the government and couldn’t figure out why they had lost contact. I hated to tell them what had happened, but they took it well. It was almost like they were prepared for this sort of thing. They acted like it was business as usual, but they kept asking us for things, telling us that they were working on a cure. I guess someone else would have walked away after a while, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t give up on the chance that they might actually have something that we needed.

I must have been wrong. We had just brought a big delivery in when they suddenly stopped contact. I couldn’t shake the gut feeling that something was horribly wrong. We tried to get in, but we couldn’t make it through. The team that we sent in lost contact after an hour, so we have no idea what’s going on in there. That’s why I’m writing to you. If anyone would be able to do it, it’s gonna be you. You’re our only hope here. Imagine a cure; imagine a new world. A world where you don’t have to keep watch every night, where you can return to your home and your job, where you can celebrate birthday parties and not have to worry where your next meal is coming from.

We all want to go back to that world, and this is the only way we’re going to be able to do it. We’re counting on you. Let me know when you get to the area and I’ll get you set up.

Sure, you’ve got a bit of experience, but how much is that really going to count when you find yourself knee deep in government security with a horde of zombies beating on the walls and doors. If it doesn’t feel like the odds are already stacked against you enough, there’s the problem with the building. They don’t want people in here. That’s one of the things about a government facility, but there’s no one with legitimate access to do the job. Contact was lost a month ago and someone’s got to get into that building and get the cure for the disease that’s ravaging the world.

Get through all of the security, including hand geometry scanners, RFID card readers, and PIN protected doors to get to the lab. Once you get inside, you’ll need to find out what happened and finish the research; that means you’ve got to do DNA testing and analysis of blood samples. They didn’t let anyone know where they left off or what happened in the facility, so it would be nice if you could let us know what happened to them. Once you get all that done, you have to upload the information through the one remaining satellite connection that has managed to survive. Get the information to your friends outside so that you can save the world.

Remember, you have sixty minutes before the entire complex will fill with poisonous gas, so it’s important that you get it done as soon as possible. On another note, please make sure not to start digging in the bodies. They could carry disease, and if you need something, it should be detached.

"Escape room ""Operation BRAVO"" by Paranoia Quest in Atlanta",https://worldofescapes.com/atlanta/quests/paranoia-quest-operation-bravo,"3333 Buford Drive NE, Suite VB03, Buford GA 30519","In 1997, Meteor RX13 crashed into the New Mexico desert as part of a large meteor shower that year. The Air Force conducted several recovery efforts based on strange energy anomalies measured and reported by NASA on the night of the shower. The samples were taken back to an NOA (National Oversight Agency) field office in Arizona before being shipped to an undisclosed NOA facility for testing and research. A former NOA scientist and whistleblower would issue a report 4 years later detailing a gruesome discovery within the RX13 specimen and a subsequent biological outbreak that had killed over 25 top NOA scientists and security personnel.
According to this whistleblower, Robert Jackson, NOA researchers had indeed discovered an active energy pattern within the meteor, prompting a further research into the anomaly. Jackson was a member of the original team responsible for studying the core samples and issuing a report back to NOA directors in Virginia. According to Jackson’s testimony, the core sample had revealed a soft inner chamber with a density of over 5000% less than the surrounding sample elements. Upon further examination of this chamber, scientists found a small fluid filled pocket within the meteorite shell containing 17 small pods, roughly the size of a kidney bean and of various coloring. These small pods had unusual heat signatures and a measurable pulse read by an EKG (electrocardiogram). This discovery sent waves through the top NOA research communities and resulted in a secondary transfer of the specimen from the geological research facility to the more modern and secured biological research facility in Virginia, only 20 miles from the NOA headquarters and well within the seat of government control and security.

Over the course of 15 years the RX13 Meteor was the subject of numerous well-funded government sponsored studies into the apparently organic mass, its composition and its origins. For 13 years very little progress was made, yet the sample remained fully intact, with an even pulse and all organic processes seemingly functional. During this time 3 of the 15 “pods” were removed from the mass and sent to other facilities internationally as part of the Global Space Transparency Agreement signed by the leaders of the 10 most powerful countries to share knowledge and research on space exploration. One sample was sent to St. Petersburg and the other to a facility outside of Paris. Within 6 months, both of these facilities suddenly went offline, disappearing completely from the intelligence grid. Overnight they went blank. Neither government could offer any explanations nor could any personnel from the facilities ever be located and questioned. The two samples disappeared, and the towns surrounding both facilities were evacuated and left desolate under military quarantines.

The remaining specimens at the NOA biolab continued to show no changes, until one day it all went wrong. After a private request from Harvard University to acquire a sample “pod” for its own research was approved, something began to happen. The sample pod was removed from the mass and placed in a separate container in the facility. Within 48 hours, there was a sudden emergency distress call from the biolab’s security station to the NOA Headquarters regarding an “outbreak” and subsequent casualties as the result of infection by a biological organism in the facility. Little more was said before the radio went dead and numerous calls from the NOA to secure lines within the facility went unanswered.

Immediately the NOA dispatched an elite task force to the facility to secure the specimens, assist survivors and neutralize any threat. Upon arrival, the team found a scene of mass carnage. Many bodies were visible on the exterior of the facility, some of them torn open from the inside, all of them dead from apparent mass hemorrhaging.

For two days, the NSA collected radio and satellite evidence of 6 attempts by NOA security teams to secure the facility before suddenly withdrawing all personnel and blacklisting the facility. Within 24 hours of the last attempt, all power had been cut, a massive fence had been largely completed around the compound, and large “No Trespassing” and “Condemned” signs popped up all around the 100-acre complex. By day three, the facility was abandoned. No budgetary statements were made to Congress; the blacklisted project simply fell from existence without any explanations at all.

The biolab workers’ families were outraged at the coverup and organized a massive Facebook petition. Within 2 months, the petition gained over 10,000 members and supporters demanding an explanation for the sudden disappearance of over 1,200 personnel, many of them fathers, mothers and children of surviving Americans. The petition was receiving national attention, and the conspiracy theorists, alternative news channels, and online media were releasing wild theories – everything from an Illuminati reptilian cover-up to a biological outbreak to an attack from Islamic Fundamentalists. From this national media attention, and subsequent government denials and refusals to release classified documents, a rogue journalistic movement was created by over 20 journalists and truth seekers from various backgrounds who, with the support of the massive family-operated Facebook petition, raised funds and organized a secret venture into the facility to get answers for themselves.

Finally, privately funded journalists and field experts illegally crossed through the fence surrounding the abandoned NOA facility and entered the laboratory where it all began…and where it would all soon end.",2-6,60,Average,Not scary,,0.4,2,6,60 minutes,nan,1,0,"3333 Buford Dr, Buford, GA 30519, USA",34.0647052,-83.98411469999999

You’ve tried to warn your neighbors and notify the police about your suspicions, but who would believe that Granny Sticky Fingers could be responsible for such a heinous crime?

Granny Sticky Fingers is a cunning old broad. She’s cleverly hidden Fluffy behind a series of locks and puzzles that only Granny and her goons know how to solve.

Together, these three groups have shaped their magical world how they saw fit. There have been disagreements over the years, but logic and wisdom always prevailed.

In this vision, he saw the one thing that could give him what he coveted most: power above all others. He saw the Cup of Destiny.

Lars knew what he had to do and in a daring nighttime raid, the Drekians stormed the Ulfuric Den and stole the cup. Horrified by the events that transpired the Ulfuric leader, Artemis Nightbane spoke with Sylvanas Tiamat, the leader of the Snakurians and together they decided that the matter was far too dangerous to ignore.

The sewer system serves as a subterranean passageway that connects one part of the city to another, and is the center of many stories and urban legends. From the resident mole people to mutant reptiles to oversized alligators, there are many accounts of what truly lies beneath.

Over the past two years, there have been a slew of disappearances surrounding Central Park, the lungs of the city. Rumors of an underground Archive of some sort, believed to be the headquarters of the notorious Tillman family, are beginning to turn from myth to reality. Many urban explorers have searched these underground waterways with hopes of one day discovering the secrets that can only be heard as echoes in the darkness.

Recently, a group of explorers that went in search of the rumored Tillman Archive went missing. Their last communications, along with their last known coordinates that pinged from their phones, made their way to the urban explorers forums. 40.7982°N; 73.9525°W. The NYPD has issued warnings around the city that access to any of these underground passages is strictly prohibited, and that all trespassers will be arrested immediately.

While the police continue conducting their own investigations, a network of urban explorers who are determined to dig into the truth is quietly compiling their own research to uncover this hidden lair. Although urban exploration is a team venture, being the first team to locate the Archive and reveal its mysteries will be able to stake claim to victory. Be warned, however, because no one knows what truly lurks in the confines of this underground labyrinth. Be brave, but also be quick. These entrances only stay dry for 90 minutes, before the waters fill the chambers, leading to a watery grave.

Do you dare to follow these coordinates and be the first group of urban explorers to make it out with the deepest, darkest secrets of the Tillman Family? Do you dare to face the unknown and expose these secrets, with the ultimate risk of being trapped underground and becoming part of the secret that might be buried forever?",2-8,90,Average,Not scary,13+,None,2,8,90 minutes,13,1,0,"5041 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Kissimmee, FL 34746, USA",28.3336233,-81.4865513
