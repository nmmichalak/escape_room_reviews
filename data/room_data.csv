He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance. 
Blackbeard only spent about two years (1716-1718) plundering the high seas. Within that time, however, he amassed a great deal of wealth. While the Spanish were busy obtaining all the gold and silver they could extract from Mexico and South America, Blackbeard and his crew waited patiently, then pounced on the treasure-laden ships as they sailed back to Spain.
On November 21, 1718 in Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, Blackbeard was ashore entertaining guests unaware that two ships led by British Lieutenant Robert Maynard were preparing a surprise attack to finally put an end to the notorious pirate. In the ensuing battle the next morning, Blackbeard was killed.
When Blackbeard’s ship was searched, no treasure was found. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumored hoard of gold and silver, but nothing has been found. Blackbeard's personal ledger notes that his real treasure ""lay in a location known only to him and the devil.""
So what became of Blackbeard’s treasure?  Is it waiting to be found or simply the stuff of legend? Back In Time has been hired by an anonymous treasure seeker to go back and search the captain's quarters in Blackbeard's ship, the Adventure, and try to shed some light on this mystery.

Loathed by scores and loved by few, Herbert’s body was discovered in the master bedroom of The Devlin Manor, an extravagant estate built by Herbert in the 1930’s.
The Devlin Manor is the home of many unspeakable truths and spirits. Over the decades, numerous “incidents” and homicides have transpired in the cursed house. In 1935, Mrs. Devlin was found dead of an apparent suicide, having hung herself from the beam over their shared marital bed. After his wife’s sudden demise, Herbert Devlin started to spiral. His mornings began with a daily cocktail of amphetamines and his nights ended in a pool of his own bile and liquor. But alas, two years later, Herbert remarried his youthful caretaker Estelle Williams, who once claimed to have seen her predecessor roaming the halls sobbing.
Six individuals (The Widow, The Firstborn, The Business Partner, The Maid, The Secondborne, and The Psychic) have, by no random accident, been named in Mr. Devlin’s final will and summoned to the manor. Upon arriving at the sprawling estate, the inheritors are greeted by the Butler and taken into the windowless dining room.
Once every guest has arrived, the Butler seals the doors shut with Mr. Devlin’s final testament, a wax-cylinder recording of his own ghoulish voice, inside. Mr. Devlin informs them that he suspects one of them to be the culprit behind his own death.

Dr. Walter Brandt is a high-ranking chemical weapons specialist for the United States government, part of a secret department that is only recognized by a series of mysterious numbers and letters. He has been developing powerful viruses capable of eradicating enemy forces with swift pace and deadly accuracy.

Foreign powers have noted Dr. Brandt's work and have recruited him to develop a powerful virus capable of killing their enemies in hours. He has gone rogue and has become a threat to the US and potentially the entire human race.

You are a team of scientists investigating Dr. Brandt's abandoned laboratory. You've been tasked with finding the only known antidote to virus TS-51 before it gets passed into enemy hands.

However, during the investigation a clumsy member of your team bumps into a shelf, sending vials of the highly contagious virus crashing to the ground. One of them breaks and sends plumes of deadly vapour into the air.

Immediately, everyone is infected but that isn't your biggest problem. The chemical detection sensor has picked up the threat and shutdown the facility. Total decontamination will begin in 60 minutes (eliminating all biological organisms inside)!

Your only chance of survival is to scour Dr. Brandt’s laboratory to find the antidote. He has hidden it from the government through a series of riddles, puzzles and codes that only the smartest can figure out.

If you do not find the security override code and antidote within 1 hour the facility will self-destruct, and there will be no escape.

Rely on your team, intellect, and keen sense of observation to solve the riddles and unlock the secrets to find the antidote and to escape the facility.
